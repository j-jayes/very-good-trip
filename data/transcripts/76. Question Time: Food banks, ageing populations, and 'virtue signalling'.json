Hello. Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And tomorrow, Friday 18th November, 9 AM is the general sale for tickets to our Christmas live show at the Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday, The 13th December. As usual, I'm afraid these tickets can go very fast, so do please sign up quickly. The link for the tickets It's in the description of this podcast, and we'll also tweet it from the rest of this politics Twitter account at 9 AM tomorrow morning, Friday 18th November. Right then. What's the first question, Alice? The first question, Rory, is do you think that we can fill the Albert Hall? I'm I'm panicking already. I I'm panicking a little bit too. We may have overreached ourselves. We had a moment where we thought we could do Wembley Stadium, and and now we're thinking, this is gonna be a bit embarrassing. It'll just be my my mother and your your son sitting in the office. Is your is your mother coming? Yeah. She'll definitely come down, and I hope your Rory will be there. So at least we'll have 2 people. Can't she bring a bus down from Creve or some other She can definitely bring a bus down from Creve. Yeah. Now first question, we sort of touched on this yesterday, but given that it was question from one of our wonderful listeners, Shannon Kyle. If Truss and Kuateng's economic policies cause £30,000,000,000 worth of the current black hole in finances, Shouldn't there be a charge of misconduct in public office? What does someone have to do in order for this charge to be brought, or is it now meaningless? Well, certainly, you can't be you can't can't be sent to jail for for for economic mismatch. And and I guess if one was gonna be cheeky, which obviously I would never be, I think let let me just put it on the record. I think Liz Truss and Quasi Cochin's decision were Absolutely catastrophically disastrous, and Gordon Brown was a much more responsible chancellor than they were. But if you were a Tory, you might point out that Gordon Brown's Sale of the gold reserves probably lost the country about £9,000,000,000 too, and nobody's suggesting that should send him to jail. Right. So if we're now we're now into economic tennis, I I will hit back The debt losses under Rishi Sunak Yeah. And I think I might with Hancock's eating his worms and his rats and whatever else he's doing in the jungle, I might throw back a bit of sort of multibillion pound PPE fraud. So yeah. Okay. That's your answer, Shannon. That's your answer. That's your answer. So Lisa Hinton, pretty straightforward. Can the UK government do anything to deter Iran from carrying out mass execution? Something we touched on Iran in the in the last part, but I suppose let's try and tempt you into thinking more about the question of how much influence the world can have on human rights. And one of the things that I'm a bit gloomy about, I guess, And I think the world has changed a lot since the nineties and 2000s, is that liberal values, democracy, human rights, Even openness to immigration, which we used to see as universal and which our governments and our people were happy to talk about more broadly now seem to have become more insular, more Contained in a single country, and people are much more reluctant to speak out. So do you think there is much the UK government can do to deter something like Iran from carrying out massive institutions? UK on its own, very little. UK as part of broader international partnership, and we talked yesterday about the UK and the EU putting new sanctions on in relation to the the Iranian response. But I think we've got this we're back to our one of our regular points about the the dividing line between democracies and the dictatorships. I don't think they really feel that heat without China indicating something other than support. I think we've seen the same with with Putin. I think although president Xi has been It was fairly measured and balanced in his meeting with Biden. I think Putin would look at his relationship with China and say that was net gain for him in relation to his handling of of Ukraine. So I think the short answer is not much, and that, of course, is very, very depressing. But the other thing, Roy, is that the reason why I'm glad we've talked about this 2 successive days. You know, people used to talk about the CNN factor in global diplomacy, the Issues which fell off the news radar, suddenly governments felt less pressure to maintain a stance and a position and at least addressing a problem. And I'm afraid, I think, for all the horrors that are happening in Iran at the moment, it's dropped off the radar. And while it drops off the radar, governments Feel less pressure. Well, there's there's there's this general fatigue point, isn't it, which is horrifying? But I'm afraid the truth is that it's I I mean, I find this moment trying to get people to focus on Giving money to end extreme poverty, which was something that in the nineties was very, very central. Remember, there was the millennium development goals, Sustainable development goals, we were gonna end global extreme poverty. And now just sort of people wince away when I put out a little tweet on it. 90% of the responses This will be we've got enough to worry about at home. We shouldn't be worrying about poor people abroad, and that extends to everything. But that's that's that's a that's a product of nationalism, isn't it? That's a product and people thinking that actually it's all about it looking inside to our own affairs. Here's 1, Rory, from Becky Canreuther. Elias. What is stopping the government from being honest with the public about the financial impact of Brexit? What is also preventing the Labour Party from doing the same? It feels criminal when some solutions to our financial woes can be found there. So what's your answer to that? Well, I guess we sort I guess we sort of know the answer because it's It's the same, presumably, for Keir Starmer as it is for Rishi Sunak. In both cases, Labour and Conservative calculate A very important chunk of their voters that they're particularly fighting over these floating voters, the red wall voters up in former Labour seats In Northern England are pro Brexit voters, and they think that nothing would anger them more than saying that Brexit's responsible for all of The flaws, that would remind them of what they saw as Project Fear in 2016, 2017. And it's and it's interesting that Keir Starmer, I mean, Rishi was a Brexiteer, a tear. Kias Sharma wasn't, but even Kias Sharma is not prepared to do this. And and that's you know, I think the the the Becky's question makes the observation. I mean, But I I was in the so called red wall, at the weekend watching Burnley's wonderful hammering of Blackburn Rovers. And I can't pretend that I went around doing focus groups. But this idea that places like Burnley and Blackburn are monolithically full of people saying if you dare mess around with my Brexit, the voices I hear there and elsewhere are, if there's a problem And you know that problem is damaging our standard of living and damaging our economy. You can't fix the problem until you've admitted the problem, and that's where we are with this. I mean, Hunt will do his statement on Thursday. Okay? And even Hunt, who, like you, like me, like Keir Starmer, voted remain, hunt all over the airways at the weekend saying, you know, Brexit's not doing any damage to the economy. He knows that's a complete fantasy. We're talking about 4% taken out of the economy year on year on year on year, minimum. I I look, I'm absolutely with you. I think that it has done a lot of damage. I think that it wasn't even necessarily a binary choice between Staying or leaving, although we would have done better economically to simply remain. But I also think that a form of customs union, Brexit, which Theresa May was Trying to push with a much closer relation to European Union would have been much, much less damaging economically, would have reassured manufacturers, markets, farmers, much more, And it's been made cruelly worse by things like the catastrophic Australia free trade deal, which I'm very pleased to see George Eustace, who's the former Environment secretary, farming secretary, who is the He might have said it when he was in the cabinet, Rory. He might have said it when he was part of the negotiations. He he did, I think, actually, to to be fair to the poor man. I think he was Horrified by it and argued very strongly against it now. Well, he should have resigned. He should have resigned. I mean, I don't have that much respect for somebody who comes out and says, The deal that I was prepared to stand by, the deal that I was prepared to support in cabinet, now that I've left the cabinet, I can tell you it was a terrible deal for Britain. Well, I guess the question for all these people, and I have some sympathy about this, but the question is, what is the issue over which you resign? So you're in the cabinet And you choose your issue. In my case, I resigned over the bigger issue of Boris Johnson becoming prime minister, not wanting him to push here, but there's no deal Brexit. Quite a big deal. If you're the guy whose department is in charge of farmers and you are now saying the deal that we did with Australia was a terrible deal For the people I represented, I don't have much respect for that. It's difficult, isn't it? You can see how people talk themselves around. I mean, look. I I I'm not trying to defend it, but you can imagine him having a conversation with his family and saying, well, yeah. If I go, it's gonna be even worse. I can see that. I can see that. Well, Jillian Keegan. Oh, yes. Yeah. My friend, Jadine Keegan. Great fan of Jadine Keegan. Yeah. Right. Your friend, Jadine Keegan, who who I know you are well. I I'm afraid, Rory, quite a few of our listeners are Not as enamored. Kieran Cox. Is Rory Stewart pleased with the way Jillian Keegan has started? I had very high hopes after his comments about her. I have been extremely underwhelmed after seeing her on the media. Marianne McGhee. I'd like to hear Rory's reaction to Jillian Keegan's Appalling remarks about nurses and food banks and breakdown boilers after he said he rated her and would like to see her in the cabinet. Now in case you don't know, Roy, that's about an interview that she was doing With Kay Burley. With Kay Burley. Yeah. I I watched it quite carefully because I've seen seen all this stuff on On Twitter. So, for for people who haven't watched the k Burley clip, you can you can see it by typing k Burley, Jillian Keegan in. Kay Burley asked Gillian, who's now the secretary state for education, whether she clapped for nurses and she said, yep, she she clapped for nurses. And then she's asked Whether she thinks nurses should get a pay rise, and then she's asked what she thinks about nurses going to food banks. And Gillian Keegan says, firstly, she says, look, it's very difficult not to feel that nurses and doctors deserve pay rises. They do incredible heroic work, but she says there are over a 1000000 people in the NHS and, we also have to think about pay for carers and others. And I guess That's something I'd be interested in you as somebody who specializes in government and comms. What is she really supposed to say? Because She does not have the authority as the education center. It's very important to understand this, I think, cabinet responsibility. How angry you would have been if your education secretary had gone out Oh, yeah. Unscripted on k Burley and said nurses need a pay rise. Yeah. But hold on, Roy. You're you're up to the point where where she talked about respecting the nurse and the doctors. You kind of have to say that. I think a cabinet ministry went up and said, I don't respect nurses, doctors. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. There's a big thing I was pushing out, Sorry. Is you wouldn't have wanted an education secretary saying they deserve a pay rise when she's not the health secretary and you're dealing with inflation? No. Agreed. So she has to give the kind of general line on that, but she then went on to say that in her experience, when she's been visiting food banks, And the question was about nurses visiting food banks. It's usually it's about people who've got a broken down boiler or their relationship has broken down. It was just a weird, Weird thing to say. It's a strange phrase, isn't it? So so so, yeah, so so what what I I let me continue my defence. So what she says there is The average salary of nurses is about £33,000 a year, which is not anything close to the minimum wage in So what she's answering is the question, why would somebody on an average income of £33,000 a year be going to a food bank? And food banks are very, very different, different parts of the country, many different reasons why people go to food banks, and I went through this again and again. As you can imagine, as a conservative MP, This is the standard question from many interviewers, many constituents, what's happening with food banks? The answer, certainly when I was an MP, is that The reason why most of the people are going to food banks is a temporary problem in their life. It's not fundamentally that their salary or, in many cases, benefits are inadequate, particularly with benefits that are very, very bad breaks between people's benefits, month delays where people are not getting the support they should, and that's The government's fault they should be sorting that out, but I also think it is probably true that if you're on an income of £33,000, then the reason you'd go to a food bank is because of some unexpected crisis or catastrophe in your family? Well, I thought it came across as being deeply lacking in political dial, skills and empathy. How how would you advance that? Well, probably much closer to how you just did. No. I think you just said, look. I visited food banks. I taught people to visit food banks and all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds, but you wouldn't say I mean, what she was basically saying she she was opening the door for her critics to say that she was disrespecting nurses. And I think that that was just a a silly thing to say. So I guess I'd say I wouldn't have said that. I would've I think making the framing argument about nurses and about the respected. And there are processes. That's all fine even if it's a bit kinda political waffly. But I think you then go on to say, I'm not going to comment on every single person who visits Every single feedback I am saying and you go back to your main point. I don't think it was I just think she was very, very loose with language. Now I was trying to think on that. We're supposed to go to a break, And let's get back again soon. Welcome back to the rest of this politics Question time with me, Rory Stewart. Hamir Scammell. Got it. Here's a big question from Epu Mccollum. That's quite a quite a big question. Maybe it's unfair to throw it at you because it's It's an 8,000,000,000, question. So cheekily repeating my question because Tuesday is 8,000,000,000, I think what he means is the world population hits 8,000,000,000 on Tuesday. How do you think China is preparing for its population to probably half in size during the century? Also, why do you think overall preparation for global Aging is still such a blind spot. It will transform societies completely. So this is a really interesting thing, obviously. I mean, Japan's getting very old. Africa, on the other hand, 1 in 10 children born in the world will be born in Nigeria by 2050, and then places like Mali, average family size is 7. And on the other hand, In many European and developed countries, and including in China because of their one child policy, populations are about to crash, which will mean that you'll have Well, here's here's a little stat just before I turn to you for your answer. I believe when Lloyd George introduced the old age pension in Britain, There was something like 12 working people for every retired person. And today, there are about two and a half Working people for every retired person, and it's gonna drop down to 2. Well, I read some guy called Thomas Sobotka, who is from the the Vienna because I saw Elon Musk. I hate talking about Elon Musk because he just likes us to talk about him. He's but Musk is on record as saying population collapse Due to low birth rate is now a bigger risk to civilization than global warming, which is quite a big statement. This thing about halving halving of Chinese population, is that Remotely right. Yeah. I think probably probably is true because the one child policy basically made yeah. One child policy was very, very strictly enforced, so parents had 1 child. And in many cases, very sadly, that became a male child because people found ways of getting rid of female children. Mhmm. So I would have thought that's probably right. Okay. Well, the Thomas Sobotka of the Vienna Institute of Demography says even the most pessimistic projections put world population in 2,100 at around 8,800,000,000. Which is higher than it is today. Which is higher than it is today, but it is not the explosion that we're talking about. So we've grown from a 1000000000 in 1800 to 7,900,000,000 in 2020. Okay? And as our questioner points out, 8 by Tuesday. Right? So that is then going to carry on rising, but at a much slower rate. Now Are we I guess what you're asking, Rory, is how bad does the state of the world have to become before it becomes politically acceptable to start talking about diminishing our global population. Is that what you're asking me? Well, no. I think it's actually very I mean, it's very interesting. So I've generally been on the side that Population is a bit is is damaging and damaging for the environment and that we can't sustain the levels of population growth that we have. And I've been actually quite impressed by how well Japan has dealt with the declining ageing population. But it's certainly true that there are many people out there who do argue that This is very, very difficult and dangerous for our economies because the point I was trying to make, I guess, about young people supporting the old people is that you end up with a very Few working people producing all the taxes, paying for an enormous number of retired people with very expensive medical needs, and that puts more and more of a burden on future generations. And that's where I think you have to hope robotics and AI are gonna come in. Mhmm. But are they going to make us live shorter or longer lives? Are they going to make us live longer lives, adding to the burden, adding to the problem? How many of us today are going to live to a a 100? Back when, you know, when you and I were growing up, reaching a100 was like a huge thing. It's now it's not commonplace, but it's it's kind of it's not a massive event every time. Does that mean I'm gonna have another 50 years of this podcast to go? Well, that would mean that I'd be a 115, which I think is I think is probably pushing it. You're going to have to get another partner, Rory, at some point, but, But, you know, that's just May may may may I have to go to the next generation of Campbells. Am I gonna sign up with Grace or Rory? You could do Rory and Rory. You could do Rory and Callum. Yeah. But we did have 1 question actually, Roy, that said, if we didn't do this podcast with each other, who would we like to do it with? Yours has to be Labor and mine has to be Tory. You first. Oh, blimey. Gosh. God, that's a really difficult question because it's gotta be somebody who's got where there's enough Disagreement. I mean, I couldn't do it with some lectures from Hunt because I'd just be agreeing with them all the time. I need a bit bit bit bit of bit of bit of edge to the whole thing. Somebody'd keep me on my toes. Somebody'd mock me. What about your friend, Steven Kinnock? Steve well, but he he and I agree too much. How about the deputy Okay. Labor leader? That could be the odds, couldn't it? You and Angela? Angela. Yeah. That'd be good. That would be good. Yeah. That'd be good. Who who would you choose as your Tory? Well, I think I quite like the natural way with Ken Clark. Yeah. That'd be good. He's even older than than I am. Yeah. I think I'll go for Ken Clark. You need a bit more friction. I think you and Ken might agree too much. Yeah. Okay. I'll maybe go I'll tell you what, I might go for Johnny Mercer, actually. You and Johnny Mercer. That could be the one. Couldn't it? We do disagree. We do we do disagree about quite a lot. You know, I think a better show, though. I'm I'm with you that you want to Johnny Mercer, but I think a better show is you and George Osborne. Right now, here we are, or you and Michael Gove. Here we are. I've got Johnny Sells, Hand luggage only for weeks on end, wearing suits. I mean, how? Hand washing every night in the sink plus laptops, Books and then Emma Gledel. And hand luggage is more difficult for women who need to carry their makeup and wear it to be deemed properly groomed. Hand luggage is then difficult with the restrictions It's on liquid. So what do you say about all that? Well, first of all, about a suit. Okay? The maximum number of suits you ever need to take to any other country is 2. You take them in a suit carrier. Okay? Very good. So you have a suit carrier, which you clip over your moderately sized wheelie bag, And you get on the plane, you smile nicely at the steward or stewardess, and you say, do you have a place to hang a suit? And 9 times out of 10, they do. So they hang your seat for you, then you put your thing. Now the thing about women and makeup and all that, now I take all my All your makeup. I take I take it all, all my overnight stuff, in One of those plastic bags that you get to go through security. It's all in there. Now if you need more than that, in my view, you're worrying far too much about how you look. So that's all you need. Don't so don't take anything that you can't fit into one of the plastic bags, and that becomes your overnight makeup bag, ladies. Very good. And then the thing about books, Bully Books, I'm sorry this may sound, you know, a bit kind of, you know, well, well, what about the cost of living crisis? But I believe in buying books. You take 1 on the plane. If If you need another woman you land, you buy it on arrival. Support local authors. Support local book shops. And here's here's here's my answer on this one, which is I am the world's biggest Kindle fan. And I used to travel with 12 books in my bag. I now travel with a single slim Kindle, and I've got the latest Kendall, which got an incredible battery, and I think I have at the moment 2 and a half 1000 books on it, so I'm never short of a book. How many of those are you rereading, Roy? Exactly. Every cigar. I had this amazingly slightly charming, slightly fraudulent Scottish dean at my college in Oxford who had a lot of books on shelves, and I said to him, my goodness. You know, have have you read all those books? And he said, some of them twice, Which sort of avoided the question I thought quietly. Now listen, Rory. I'm going to say something moderately supportive of a conservative minister even though I don't supporting much in what it is education. But, your friend, Nick Gibb. Oh, yes. Who who incidentally incidentally, on all the notes that they took for the formation of the new ministerial thing. They also listened to us on that. Remember? I was pitching him to get back into his position. Yes. True. That's So good old Rishi. We we we need to think about things to tell Rishi. So we got lots of questions this week about languages, foreign languages. And Nick Gibb, I see, put out a thing saying that he thinks that there should be more learning of German. Well, I totally support that. And the numbers now doing German a level are so small. It's kind of embarrassing. So lots of questions. Here's one from Martin Caldwell. I live in Berlin. I speak German. How do we change the culture in the UK to value learning a language? Freya Goldschmidt. As the next head of languages at State School, I think we need to reform the teaching of languages. It's just not working. Beth, I remember you saying, that's me, your father was a Scots Gaelic speaker. Can't remember if Rory's family were. I don't think so. My grandfather was Welsh monologue until middle school. With education being so topical, how do you feel about mandatory Gaelic and Welsh being taught in schools there? And then final one, Dennis Richards, former head, French teacher, Please ask Alice to explain Braverman's views given that she lived in France for 2 years on the Erasmus program, then wrecked the opportunity for my students. What do you think happened? What happened, Dennis, is the old story about climbing the ladder and pulling it away. Yeah. Just stats on length just quickly. So across the UK, German was taken by 36 1000 teenagers at GCSE, down from 58,000 in 2012. And by only less than 2,000 state school students Took it at 8 o'clock. Fewer fewer. Sorry. Yeah. 800 private schools. So that's only 2,800 people, and it's tiny numbers speaking. And, of course, you've got You'd presumably say that to actually have any hope of speaking decent German, you need to do at least state level, if not a degree, but that's only 2,000 people in the whole country who are Speaking even moderate German a year. And I do think even though English is recognized as gonna be, you know, the language of the world in so many ways, it's not always going to be like that. Now where I would disagree with Nick, I don't know whether we broadened it. I remember when I was growing up, my mom saying, oh, we're going to the common market. You should learn languages and all that, and I kinda do that. I've always loved. Well, I didn't. I've always loved learning languages. But I I think today, I would be learning Chinese and Arabic. I think they're the languages that we should be we should be focusing on. But at the same time, there is such a value in learning another language regardless. This idea that you only do things so that you then go and do jobs where you use them. It's such a good thing per se to learn a foreign language, to go through the process of learning, to enjoy a different language, to enjoy the cultures of different country. And I think it's sad that we've just allowed that to to fall off. And I don't criticize the Labour government that much as you know, Rory, but I do think that we made a mistake in in downgrading the significance of languages within our education system. Well, the Chinese Chinese is something that the Scots have made a real effort to invest in. And, actually, my my father spoke Very good Chinese, and as an old man in his eighties was allowed to teach Chinese a little bit in Scottish schools. But although Scotland's had a huge decline, like England, in the number of people We're doing language hires. There's been a big increase in the number of people who are doing Mandarin, and I think that's a Yeah. It's a smart investment. Yeah. Yeah. Now, Roy, we are now getting so many questions because we get them on Twitter. We get them on Instagram. We get them on email. I now, when I'm going through the questions, and I have a special category, which I put under the headline, people accusing us of ignoring things. I'd just like to say to those people, we are getting well over a 1000 questions every single week. Not answering your question does not mean that we disrespect queue or that we're ignoring things. It's just that we can't get through them all. But here's one criticizing us for things we don't talk about. Ashkartman, you still haven't talked about local government. Is that because you both find it boring and not as sexy as talking about international affairs? To most people in the UK, it matters much more than what's happening halfway around the world. So I think we have talked about local government, sort of, but not maybe say now let's Talk about local government. We do talk about local. Well and and another question, I think, from Julie Hudson on on the same thing. Well, then let's let's maybe finish on that if that's right, because I think we come towards the end. And I think I I'd say my starter before I hand back to you that it is very striking how much local government matters to people, but also how little All people know about their local representatives. I mean, I was struck that people can often name their MP, but struggle to name local councilors local mayors. And that's very frustrating because often the things that mattered when I was a constituency MP, people wanted to talk to me about very local issues, Could be even parking, planning, things that I actually, as a member of parliament, had no control over. They were run by the district or the county council, But they didn't vote in local elections, didn't know the names of their district and county councilors. And we had this very sad thing in Bristol, which is they just voted to get rid of a mayor who I Thought it was doing quite a good job. So- Yeah, it was terrific. Yeah. So I think it's very sad that Britain seems to have this allergy Towards I I'd like to be like the French where you have a a mayor in each small village in town who you can meet in the supermarket, poke in the chest, and hold accountable for what's happening. Ticket. No. I I I I think the other thing that's related to that is the, the downgrading of local journalism as well, that local Papers really, really struggle now. And I you know, part of that, again, is people's habits of going online or of, you know, dare I say, listening to podcast rather than getting their local paper, whatever it might be. I mean, I guess the other thing I'd say, Ash, is that If we were to focus so we got the the Jeremy Hunt statement coming up. I bet there will be my hunch is that amongst the kind of book balancing that he's trying to do. We're gonna see rises in council tax. Councils, I think, get an awful lot of criticism. Some of it deserved a lot of it. I think people underestimate the extent to which councils are dependent upon national government. And, therefore, that Explains maybe it's another reason why we do focus more on national government. And, also, Ash, I think you know that both Rory and I have got a shared interest in in foreign policy and foreign affairs, and also a shared belief that our media doesn't focus enough on it. So that might might explain as well. I'm gonna give a shout out to my local representative and tell you you'll enjoy this, Rory. It's an event I attended yesterday, hosted by Georgia Gould, who is the leader of Yes. Of course. Council. Philip Gould's daughter. Philip Gould's daughter. Yep. And She was presiding over the renaming of an area close to where I live on the edge of Hampstead Heath. And if you go to South End Green now, you go round this roundabout, you'll see on the roundabout, it is now called Boris Nemtsov Square and Boris Nemesoft place. And it's at the bottom of the hill going up to the Russian trade delegation where lots of diplomats and spooks and assorted Putin supporters live, and not to mention the oligarchs who live up the top as well. And what was the extraordinary about it? There was the Evgeny Karamuotso. Very quickly, just to remind people, Boris Nemtsov was a dissident leader in Russia who was assassinated on the on the Bolshoy Mosk Poderetsky bridge in 2015 Yeah. By agents Vladimir Putin. Yeah. And who was one of the I I actually met him way back with Tony Blair when he was he and Chabias, the Nemtsov and Chabias were the 2 sort of great reformers. So he's now dead. There was a message read out from his daughter. There was the wife of a a guy who's been doing much the same sort of work and who's been poisoned twice, who went back to Russia. He's now in a gulag somewhere. And while this was going on and lots of people there, your friend Steven Kinnock was there and Tom Brake from the Lib Dems, and there was a shout out for that guy, Mark Pritchard, the Tories. It was a kind of all All party thing. And there were these local protesters from Hampstead and Highgate with vuvuzailers, which they hooted throughout all of the speeches, including this woman, Evgenia, talking about her Husband languishing in jail, having survived these poisoning attempts and so forth, and they were waving banners saying, you know, we demand more democracy. And the democracy they were complaining about was they didn't like the fact that Camden Council hadn't gone with their view on the consultation about whether to rename this for this mental square. And, I mean, it was just like, like, it was the parallel universe that was going on there was extraordinary. In fact, there was a woman who came up to me and said, oh, you're here for the virtue ignoring RU? Well, I am a 100% behind things like that. I think at a time when, you know, we sometimes feel powerless at what's happening in Ukraine, sometimes these symbolic things and these gestures of support. And I'll tell you the thing that really brought it home to me, Rory. You'll love this. Guess who came up to me and said, in a very Russian accent, I'd really enjoy your podcast. Who? Don. Marina Litvinenko. Gosh. Goodness. So there you go. Amazing. Right. Well, let's let's finish on that, and lovely to talk to you, and let's talk next week. All the best.",

Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And tomorrow, Friday 18th November, 9 AM is the general sale for tickets to our Christmas live show at the Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday, The 13th December. As usual, I'm afraid these tickets can go very fast, so do please sign up quickly. The link for the tickets It's in the description of this podcast, and we'll also tweet it from the rest of this politics Twitter account at 9 AM tomorrow morning, Friday 18th November. Right then. What's the first question, Alice?\n\nSpeaker 0: The first question, Rory, is do you think that we can fill the Albert Hall? I'm I'm panicking already.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I'm panicking a little bit too. We may have overreached ourselves. We had a moment where we thought we could do Wembley Stadium, and and now we're thinking, this\n\nSpeaker 0: is gonna be\n\nSpeaker 1: a bit embarrassing. It'll just be my my mother and your your son sitting in the office.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is your is your mother coming?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. She'll definitely come down, and I hope your Rory will be there. So at least we'll have 2 people.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can't she bring a bus down from Creve or some other She\n\nSpeaker 1: can definitely bring a bus down from Creve. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now first question, we sort of touched on this yesterday, but given that it was question from one of our wonderful listeners, Shannon Kyle. If Truss and Kuateng's economic policies cause £30,000,000,000 worth of the current black hole in finances, Shouldn't there be a charge of misconduct in public office? What does someone have to do in order for this charge to be brought, or is it now meaningless?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, certainly, you can't be you can't can't be sent to jail for for for economic mismatch. And and I guess if one was gonna be cheeky, which obviously I would never be, I think let let me just put it on the record. I think Liz Truss and Quasi Cochin's decision were Absolutely catastrophically disastrous, and Gordon Brown was a much more responsible chancellor than they were. But if you were a Tory, you might point out that Gordon Brown's Sale of the gold reserves probably lost the country about £9,000,000,000 too, and nobody's suggesting that should send him to jail.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. So if we're now we're now into economic tennis, I I will hit back The debt losses under Rishi Sunak Yeah. And I think I might with Hancock's eating his worms and his rats and whatever else he's doing in the jungle, I might throw back a bit of sort of multibillion pound PPE fraud. So yeah. Okay.\n\nThat's your answer, Shannon. That's your answer.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's your answer. So Lisa Hinton, pretty straightforward. Can the UK government do anything to deter Iran from carrying out mass execution? Something we touched on Iran in the in the last part, but I suppose let's try and tempt you into thinking more about the question of how much influence the world can have on human rights. And one of the things that I'm a bit gloomy about, I guess, And I think the world has changed a lot since the nineties and 2000s, is that liberal values, democracy, human rights, Even openness to immigration, which we used to see as universal and which our governments and our people were happy to talk about more broadly now seem to have become more insular, more Contained in a single country, and people are much more reluctant to speak out.\n\nSo do you think there is much the UK government can do to deter something like Iran from carrying out massive institutions?\n\nSpeaker 0: UK on its own, very little. UK as part of broader international partnership, and we talked yesterday about the UK and the EU putting new sanctions on in relation to the the Iranian response. But I think we've got this we're back to our one of our regular points about the the dividing line between democracies and the dictatorships. I don't think they really feel that heat without China indicating something other than support. I think we've seen the same with with Putin.\n\nI think although president Xi has been It was fairly measured and balanced in his meeting with Biden. I think Putin would look at his relationship with China and say that was net gain for him in relation to his handling of of Ukraine. So I think the short answer is not much, and that, of course, is very, very depressing. But the other thing, Roy, is that the reason why I'm glad we've talked about this 2 successive days. You know, people used to talk about the CNN factor in global diplomacy, the Issues which fell off the news radar, suddenly governments felt less pressure to maintain a stance and a position and at least addressing a problem.\n\nAnd I'm afraid, I think, for all the horrors that are happening in Iran at the moment, it's dropped off the radar. And while it drops off the radar, governments Feel less pressure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there's there's there's this general fatigue point, isn't it, which is horrifying? But I'm afraid the truth is that it's I I mean, I find this moment trying to get people to focus on Giving money to end extreme poverty, which was something that in the nineties was very, very central. Remember, there was the millennium development goals, Sustainable development goals, we were gonna end global extreme poverty. And now just sort of people wince away when I put out a little tweet on it. 90% of the responses This will be we've got enough to worry about at home.\n\nWe shouldn't be worrying about poor people abroad, and that extends to everything.\n\nSpeaker 0: But that's that's that's a that's a product of nationalism, isn't it? That's a product and people thinking that actually it's all about it looking inside to our own affairs. Here's 1, Rory, from Becky Canreuther. Elias. What is stopping the government from being honest with the public about the financial impact of Brexit?\n\nWhat is also preventing the Labour Party from doing the same? It feels criminal when some solutions to our financial woes can be found there. So what's your answer to that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I guess we sort I guess we sort of know the answer because it's It's the same, presumably, for Keir Starmer as it is for Rishi Sunak. In both cases, Labour and Conservative calculate A very important chunk of their voters that they're particularly fighting over these floating voters, the red wall voters up in former Labour seats In Northern England are pro Brexit voters, and they think that nothing would anger them more than saying that Brexit's responsible for all of The flaws, that would remind them of what they saw as Project Fear in 2016, 2017. And it's and it's interesting that Keir Starmer, I mean, Rishi was a Brexiteer, a tear. Kias Sharma wasn't, but even Kias Sharma is not prepared to do this.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and that's you know, I think the the the Becky's question makes the observation. I mean, But I I was in the so called red wall, at the weekend watching Burnley's wonderful hammering of Blackburn Rovers. And I can't pretend that I went around doing focus groups. But this idea that places like Burnley and Blackburn are monolithically full of people saying if you dare mess around with my Brexit, the voices I hear there and elsewhere are, if there's a problem And you know that problem is damaging our standard of living and damaging our economy. You can't fix the problem until you've admitted the problem, and that's where we are with this.\n\nI mean, Hunt will do his statement on Thursday. Okay? And even Hunt, who, like you, like me, like Keir Starmer, voted remain, hunt all over the airways at the weekend saying, you know, Brexit's not doing any damage to the economy. He knows that's a complete fantasy. We're talking about 4% taken out of the economy year on year on year on year, minimum.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I look, I'm absolutely with you. I think that it has done a lot of damage. I think that it wasn't even necessarily a binary choice between Staying or leaving, although we would have done better economically to simply remain. But I also think that a form of customs union, Brexit, which Theresa May was Trying to push with a much closer relation to European Union would have been much, much less damaging economically, would have reassured manufacturers, markets, farmers, much more, And it's been made cruelly worse by things like the catastrophic Australia free trade deal, which I'm very pleased to see George Eustace, who's the former Environment secretary, farming secretary, who is\n\nSpeaker 0: the He might have said it when he was in the cabinet, Rory. He might have said it when he was part of the negotiations.\n\nSpeaker 1: He he did, I think, actually, to to be fair to the poor man. I think he was Horrified by it and argued very strongly against it now.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, he should have resigned. He should have resigned. I mean, I don't have that much respect for somebody who comes out and says, The deal that I was prepared to stand by, the deal that I was prepared to support in cabinet, now that I've left the cabinet, I can tell you it was a terrible deal for Britain.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I guess the question for all these people, and I have some sympathy about this, but the question is, what is the issue over which you resign? So you're in the cabinet And you choose your issue. In my case, I resigned over the bigger issue of Boris Johnson becoming prime minister, not wanting him to push here, but there's no deal Brexit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Quite a big deal. If you're the guy whose department is in charge of farmers and you are now saying the deal that we did with Australia was a terrible deal For the people I represented, I don't have much respect for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's difficult, isn't it? You can see how people talk themselves around. I mean, look. I I I'm not trying to defend it, but you can imagine him having a conversation with his family and saying, well, yeah. If I go, it's gonna be even worse.\n\nI can see that.\n\nSpeaker 0: I can see that. Well, Jillian Keegan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. Yeah. My friend, Jadine Keegan. Great fan of Jadine Keegan. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Your friend, Jadine Keegan, who who I know you are well. I I'm afraid, Rory, quite a few of our listeners are Not as enamored. Kieran Cox. Is Rory Stewart pleased with the way Jillian Keegan has started?\n\nI had very high hopes after his comments about her. I have been extremely underwhelmed after seeing her on the media. Marianne McGhee. I'd like to hear Rory's reaction to Jillian Keegan's Appalling remarks about nurses and food banks and breakdown boilers after he said he rated her and would like to see her in the cabinet. Now in case you don't know, Roy, that's about an interview that she was doing\n\nSpeaker 1: With Kay Burley. With Kay Burley. Yeah. I I watched it quite carefully because I've seen seen all this stuff on On Twitter. So, for for people who haven't watched the k Burley clip, you can you can see it by typing k Burley, Jillian Keegan in.\n\nKay Burley asked Gillian, who's now the secretary state for education, whether she clapped for nurses and she said, yep, she she clapped for nurses. And then she's asked Whether she thinks nurses should get a pay rise, and then she's asked what she thinks about nurses going to food banks. And Gillian Keegan says, firstly, she says, look, it's very difficult not to feel that nurses and doctors deserve pay rises. They do incredible heroic work, but she says there are over a 1000000 people in the NHS and, we also have to think about pay for carers and others. And I guess That's something I'd be interested in you as somebody who specializes in government and comms.\n\nWhat is she really supposed to say? Because She does not have the authority as the education center. It's very important to understand this, I think, cabinet responsibility. How angry you would have been if your education secretary had gone out Oh, yeah. Unscripted on k Burley and said nurses need a pay rise.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But hold on, Roy. You're you're up to the point where where she talked about respecting the nurse and the doctors. You kind of have to say that. I think a cabinet ministry went up and said, I don't respect nurses, doctors.\n\nNo. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. No. No. No.\n\nNo. No. No.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. There's a\n\nSpeaker 1: big thing I was pushing out, Sorry. Is you wouldn't have wanted an education secretary saying they deserve a pay rise when she's not the health secretary and you're dealing with inflation? No.\n\nSpeaker 0: Agreed. So she has to give the kind of general line on that, but she then went on to say that in her experience, when she's been visiting food banks, And the question was about nurses visiting food banks. It's usually it's about people who've got a broken down boiler or their relationship has broken down. It was just a weird, Weird thing to say. It's a\n\nSpeaker 1: strange phrase, isn't it? So so so, yeah, so so what what I I let me continue my defence. So what she says there is The average salary of nurses is about £33,000 a year, which is not anything close to the minimum wage in So what she's answering is the question, why would somebody on an average income of £33,000 a year be going to a food bank? And food banks are very, very different, different parts of the country, many different reasons why people go to food banks, and I went through this again and again. As you can imagine, as a conservative MP, This is the standard question from many interviewers, many constituents, what's happening with food banks?\n\nThe answer, certainly when I was an MP, is that The reason why most of the people are going to food banks is a temporary problem in their life. It's not fundamentally that their salary or, in many cases, benefits are inadequate, particularly with benefits that are very, very bad breaks between people's benefits, month delays where people are not getting the support they should, and that's The government's fault they should be sorting that out, but I also think it is probably true that if you're on an income of £33,000, then the reason you'd go to a food bank is because of some unexpected crisis or catastrophe in your family?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I thought it came across as being deeply lacking in political dial, skills and empathy.\n\nSpeaker 1: How how would you advance that? Well, probably\n\nSpeaker 0: much closer to how you just did. No. I think you just said, look. I visited food banks. I taught people to visit food banks and all sorts of people from all sorts of backgrounds, but you wouldn't say I mean, what she was basically saying she she was opening the door for her critics to say that she was disrespecting nurses.\n\nAnd I think that that was just a a silly thing to say. So I guess I'd say I wouldn't have said that. I would've I think making the framing argument about nurses and about the respected. And there are processes. That's all fine even if it's a bit kinda political waffly.\n\nBut I think you then go on to say, I'm not going to comment on every single person who visits Every single feedback I am saying and you go back to your main point. I don't think it was I just think she was very, very loose with language.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now I was trying to think on that. We're supposed to go to a break, And let's get back again soon. Welcome back to the rest of this politics Question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: Hamir Scammell. Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's a big question from Epu Mccollum. That's quite a quite a big question. Maybe it's unfair to throw it at you because it's It's an 8,000,000,000, question. So cheekily repeating my question because Tuesday is 8,000,000,000, I think what he means is the world population hits 8,000,000,000 on Tuesday. How do you think China is preparing for its population to probably half in size during the century?\n\nAlso, why do you think overall preparation for global Aging is still such a blind spot. It will transform societies completely. So this is a really interesting thing, obviously. I mean, Japan's getting very old. Africa, on the other hand, 1 in 10 children born in the world will be born in Nigeria by 2050, and then places like Mali, average family size is 7.\n\nAnd on the other hand, In many European and developed countries, and including in China because of their one child policy, populations are about to crash, which will mean that you'll have Well, here's here's a little stat just before I turn to you for your answer. I believe when Lloyd George introduced the old age pension in Britain, There was something like 12 working people for every retired person. And today, there are about two and a half Working people for every retired person, and it's gonna drop down to 2.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I read some guy called Thomas Sobotka, who is from the the Vienna because I saw Elon Musk. I hate talking about Elon Musk because he just likes us to talk about him. He's but Musk is on record as saying population collapse Due to low birth rate is now a bigger risk to civilization than global warming, which is quite a big statement. This thing about halving halving of Chinese population, is that Remotely right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think probably probably is true because the one child policy basically made yeah. One child policy was very, very strictly enforced, so parents had 1 child. And in many cases, very sadly, that became a male child because people found ways of getting rid of female children. Mhmm.\n\nSo I would have thought that's probably right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Well, the Thomas Sobotka of the Vienna Institute of Demography says even the most pessimistic projections put world population in 2,100 at around 8,800,000,000.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is higher than it is today. Which is higher than it\n\nSpeaker 0: is today, but it is not the explosion that we're talking about. So we've grown from a 1000000000 in 1800 to 7,900,000,000 in 2020. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: And as our questioner points out, 8 by Tuesday.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right? So that is then going to carry on rising, but at a much slower rate. Now Are we I guess what you're asking, Rory, is how bad does the state of the world have to become before it becomes politically acceptable to start talking about diminishing our global population. Is that what you're asking me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, no. I think it's actually very I mean, it's very interesting. So I've generally been on the side that Population is a bit is is damaging and damaging for the environment and that we can't sustain the levels of population growth that we have. And I've been actually quite impressed by how well Japan has dealt with the declining ageing population. But it's certainly true that there are many people out there who do argue that This is very, very difficult and dangerous for our economies because the point I was trying to make, I guess, about young people supporting the old people is that you end up with a very Few working people producing all the taxes, paying for an enormous number of retired people with very expensive medical needs, and that puts more and more of a burden on future generations.\n\nAnd that's where I think you have to hope robotics and AI are gonna come in.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. But are they going to make us live shorter or longer lives? Are they going to make us live longer lives, adding to the burden, adding to the problem? How many of us today are going to live to a a 100? Back when, you know, when you and I were growing up, reaching a100 was like a huge thing.\n\nIt's now it's not commonplace, but it's it's kind of it's not a massive event every time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Does that mean I'm gonna have another 50 years of this podcast to go?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that would mean that I'd be a 115, which I think is I think is probably pushing it. You're going to have to get another partner, Rory, at some point, but, But, you know, that's just\n\nSpeaker 1: May may may may I have to go to the next generation of Campbells. Am I gonna sign up with Grace or Rory?\n\nSpeaker 0: You could do Rory and Rory. You could do Rory and Callum. Yeah. But we did have 1 question actually, Roy, that said, if we didn't do this podcast with each other, who would we like to do it with? Yours has to be Labor and mine has to be Tory.\n\nYou first. Oh, blimey. Gosh.\n\nSpeaker 1: God, that's a really difficult question because it's gotta be somebody who's got where there's enough Disagreement. I mean, I couldn't do it with some lectures from Hunt because I'd just be agreeing with them all the time. I need a bit bit bit bit of bit of bit of edge to the whole thing. Somebody'd keep me on my toes. Somebody'd mock me.\n\nSpeaker 0: What about your friend, Steven Kinnock?\n\nSpeaker 1: Steve well, but he he and I agree too much. How about the\n\nSpeaker 0: deputy Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Labor leader? That could be the odds, couldn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: You and Angela?\n\nSpeaker 1: Angela. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: That'd be good. That would be good. Yeah. That'd be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who who would you choose as your Tory?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think I quite like the natural way with Ken Clark.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That'd be good.\n\nSpeaker 0: He's even older than than I am. Yeah. I think I'll go for Ken Clark. You need\n\nSpeaker 1: a bit more friction. I think you and Ken might agree too much.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. I'll maybe go I'll tell you what, I might go for Johnny Mercer, actually.\n\nSpeaker 1: You and Johnny Mercer. That could be the one. Couldn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: We do disagree. We do we do disagree about quite a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I think a better show, though. I'm I'm with you that you want to Johnny Mercer, but I think a better show is you and George Osborne. Right now, here we are, or you and Michael Gove. Here we are. I've got Johnny Sells, Hand luggage only for weeks on end, wearing suits.\n\nI mean, how? Hand washing every night in the sink plus laptops, Books and then Emma Gledel. And hand luggage is more difficult for women who need to carry their makeup and wear it to be deemed properly groomed. Hand luggage is then difficult with the restrictions It's on liquid. So what do you say about all that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, first of all, about a suit. Okay? The maximum number of suits you ever need to take to any other country is 2. You take them in a suit carrier. Okay?\n\nVery good. So you have a suit carrier, which you clip over your moderately sized wheelie bag, And you get on the plane, you smile nicely at the steward or stewardess, and you say, do you have a place to hang a suit? And 9 times out of 10, they do. So they hang your seat for you, then you put your thing. Now the thing about women and makeup and all that, now I take all my\n\nSpeaker 1: All your makeup.\n\nSpeaker 0: I take I take it all, all my overnight stuff, in One of those plastic bags that you get to go through security. It's all in there. Now if you need more than that, in my view, you're worrying far too much about how you look. So that's all you need. Don't so don't take anything that you can't fit into one of the plastic bags, and that becomes your overnight makeup bag, ladies.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. And then\n\nSpeaker 0: the thing about books, Bully Books, I'm sorry this may sound, you know, a bit kind of, you know, well, well, what about the cost of living crisis? But I believe in buying books. You take 1 on the plane. If If you need another woman you land, you buy it on arrival. Support local authors.\n\nSupport local book shops.\n\nSpeaker 1: And here's here's here's my answer on this one, which is I am the world's biggest Kindle fan. And I used to travel with 12 books in my bag. I now travel with a single slim Kindle, and I've got the latest Kendall, which got an incredible battery, and I think I have at the moment 2 and a half 1000 books on it, so I'm never short of a book.\n\nSpeaker 0: How many of those are you rereading, Roy?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Every cigar. I had this amazingly slightly charming, slightly fraudulent Scottish dean at my college in Oxford who had a lot of books on shelves, and I said to him, my goodness. You know, have have you read all those books? And he said, some of them twice, Which sort of avoided the question I thought quietly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now listen, Rory. I'm going to say something moderately supportive of a conservative minister even though I don't supporting much in what it is education. But, your friend, Nick Gibb.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. Who who incidentally incidentally, on all the notes that they took for the formation of the new ministerial thing. They also listened to us on that. Remember? I was pitching him to get back into his position.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. True. That's So good old Rishi. We we we need to think about things to tell Rishi. So we got lots of questions this week about languages, foreign languages.\n\nAnd Nick Gibb, I see, put out a thing saying that he thinks that there should be more learning of German. Well, I totally support that. And the numbers now doing German a level are so small. It's kind of embarrassing. So lots of questions.\n\nHere's one from Martin Caldwell. I live in Berlin. I speak German. How do we change the culture in the UK to value learning a language? Freya Goldschmidt.\n\nAs the next head of languages at State School, I think we need to reform the teaching of languages. It's just not working. Beth, I remember you saying, that's me, your father was a Scots Gaelic speaker. Can't remember if Rory's family were. I don't think so.\n\nMy grandfather was Welsh monologue until middle school. With education being so topical, how do you feel about mandatory Gaelic and Welsh being taught in schools there? And then final one, Dennis Richards, former head, French teacher, Please ask Alice to explain Braverman's views given that she lived in France for 2 years on the Erasmus program, then wrecked the opportunity for my students. What do you think happened? What happened, Dennis, is the old story about climbing the ladder and pulling it away.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Just stats on length just quickly. So across the UK, German was taken by 36 1000 teenagers at GCSE, down from 58,000 in 2012. And by only less than 2,000 state school students Took it at 8 o'clock. Fewer fewer.\n\nSorry. Yeah. 800 private schools. So that's only 2,800 people, and it's tiny numbers speaking. And, of course, you've got You'd presumably say that to actually have any hope of speaking decent German, you need to do at least state level, if not a degree, but that's only 2,000 people in the whole country who are Speaking even moderate German a year.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I do think even though English is recognized as gonna be, you know, the language of the world in so many ways, it's not always going to be like that. Now where I would disagree with Nick, I don't know whether we broadened it. I remember when I was growing up, my mom saying, oh, we're going to the common market. You should learn languages and all that, and I kinda do that. I've always loved.\n\nWell, I didn't. I've always loved learning languages. But I I think today, I would be learning Chinese and Arabic. I think they're the languages that we should be we should be focusing on. But at the same time, there is such a value in learning another language regardless.\n\nThis idea that you only do things so that you then go and do jobs where you use them. It's such a good thing per se to learn a foreign language, to go through the process of learning, to enjoy a different language, to enjoy the cultures of different country. And I think it's sad that we've just allowed that to to fall off. And I don't criticize the Labour government that much as you know, Rory, but I do think that we made a mistake in in downgrading the significance of languages within our education system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the Chinese Chinese is something that the Scots have made a real effort to invest in. And, actually, my my father spoke Very good Chinese, and as an old man in his eighties was allowed to teach Chinese a little bit in Scottish schools. But although Scotland's had a huge decline, like England, in the number of people We're doing language hires. There's been a big increase in the number of people who are doing Mandarin, and I think that's a Yeah. It's a smart investment.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Now, Roy, we are now getting so many questions because we get them on Twitter. We get them on Instagram. We get them on email.\n\nI now, when I'm going through the questions, and I have a special category, which I put under the headline, people accusing us of ignoring things. I'd just like to say to those people, we are getting well over a 1000 questions every single week. Not answering your question does not mean that we disrespect queue or that we're ignoring things. It's just that we can't get through them all. But here's one criticizing us for things we don't talk about.\n\nAshkartman, you still haven't talked about local government. Is that because you both find it boring and not as sexy as talking about international affairs? To most people in the UK, it matters much more than what's happening halfway around the world. So I think we have talked about local government, sort of, but not maybe say now let's Talk about local government. We do talk about local.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well and and another question, I think, from Julie Hudson on on the same thing. Well, then let's let's maybe finish on that if that's right, because I think we come towards the end. And I think I I'd say my starter before I hand back to you that it is very striking how much local government matters to people, but also how little All people know about their local representatives. I mean, I was struck that people can often name their MP, but struggle to name local councilors local mayors. And that's very frustrating because often the things that mattered when I was a constituency MP, people wanted to talk to me about very local issues, Could be even parking, planning, things that I actually, as a member of parliament, had no control over.\n\nThey were run by the district or the county council, But they didn't vote in local elections, didn't know the names of their district and county councilors. And we had this very sad thing in Bristol, which is they just voted to get rid of a mayor who I Thought it was doing quite a good job. So- Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 0: it was terrific. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think it's very sad that Britain seems to have this allergy Towards I I'd like to be like the French where you have a a mayor in each small village in town who you can meet in the supermarket, poke in the chest, and hold accountable for what's happening.\n\nSpeaker 0: Ticket. No. I I I I think the other thing that's related to that is the, the downgrading of local journalism as well, that local Papers really, really struggle now. And I you know, part of that, again, is people's habits of going online or of, you know, dare I say, listening to podcast rather than getting their local paper, whatever it might be. I mean, I guess the other thing I'd say, Ash, is that If we were to focus so we got the the Jeremy Hunt statement coming up.\n\nI bet there will be my hunch is that amongst the kind of book balancing that he's trying to do. We're gonna see rises in council tax. Councils, I think, get an awful lot of criticism. Some of it deserved a lot of it. I think people underestimate the extent to which councils are dependent upon national government.\n\nAnd, therefore, that Explains maybe it's another reason why we do focus more on national government. And, also, Ash, I think you know that both Rory and I have got a shared interest in in foreign policy and foreign affairs, and also a shared belief that our media doesn't focus enough on it. So that might might explain as well. I'm gonna give a shout out to my local representative and tell you you'll enjoy this, Rory. It's an event I attended yesterday, hosted by Georgia Gould, who is the leader of Yes.\n\nOf course. Council.\n\nSpeaker 1: Philip Gould's daughter.\n\nSpeaker 0: Philip Gould's daughter. Yep. And She was presiding over the renaming of an area close to where I live on the edge of Hampstead Heath. And if you go to South End Green now, you go round this roundabout, you'll see on the roundabout, it is now called Boris Nemtsov Square and Boris Nemesoft place. And it's at the bottom of the hill going up to the Russian trade delegation where lots of diplomats and spooks and assorted Putin supporters live, and not to mention the oligarchs who live up the top as well.\n\nAnd what was the extraordinary about it? There was the Evgeny Karamuotso.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very quickly, just to remind people, Boris Nemtsov was a dissident leader in Russia who was assassinated on the on the Bolshoy Mosk Poderetsky bridge in 2015 Yeah. By agents Vladimir Putin.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And who was one of the I I actually met him way back with Tony Blair when he was he and Chabias, the Nemtsov and Chabias were the 2 sort of great reformers. So he's now dead. There was a message read out from his daughter. There was the wife of a a guy who's been doing much the same sort of work and who's been poisoned twice, who went back to Russia.\n\nHe's now in a gulag somewhere. And while this was going on and lots of people there, your friend Steven Kinnock was there and Tom Brake from the Lib Dems, and there was a shout out for that guy, Mark Pritchard, the Tories. It was a kind of all All party thing. And there were these local protesters from Hampstead and Highgate with vuvuzailers, which they hooted throughout all of the speeches, including this woman, Evgenia, talking about her Husband languishing in jail, having survived these poisoning attempts and so forth, and they were waving banners saying, you know, we demand more democracy. And the democracy they were complaining about was they didn't like the fact that Camden Council hadn't gone with their view on the consultation about whether to rename this for this mental square.\n\nAnd, I mean, it was just like, like, it was the parallel universe that was going on there was extraordinary. In fact, there was a woman who came up to me and said, oh, you're here for the virtue ignoring RU? Well, I am a 100% behind things like that. I think at a time when, you know, we sometimes feel powerless at what's happening in Ukraine, sometimes these symbolic things and these gestures of support. And I'll tell you the thing that really brought it home to me, Rory.\n\nYou'll love this. Guess who came up to me and said, in a very Russian accent, I'd really enjoy your podcast. Who? Don. Marina Litvinenko.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gosh. Goodness. So there you go. Amazing. Right.\n\nWell, let's let's finish on that, and lovely to talk to you, and let's talk next week.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best.",
