That's the rest is politics.com. Welcome to another episode of The Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell. I'm with me, Rory Stewart. And we're gonna talk about matters Nadim Zahawi, matters Richard Sharp, the BBC, and the Boris Johnson sleaze. We're gonna talk about Sunak more generally. How is he doing after his 1st 100 days? We're on the 3rd anniversary of the exit from the European Union. I suspect we may touch upon that. And I think we need to touch on the Middle East as well. And, also, Rory, I'm very keen to talk about Nagorno Karabakh. So your friend, Nadim Zahawi, I predicted he would go. He has gone, but he's gone in a way that I think has not just damaged him and his career, but I think he's damaged Rishi Sunak as well. Yeah. Well, I think the I agree. I think the lesson there are couple of lessons for this. One of them is the problem for politicians, and I think that Comes into conflict of interest and cover up. So I think when we look at people's finances and their income, the big The question is always around conflict of interest, and here, the clear conflict of interest was that he was the chancellor of the exchequer when he was negotiating his Own tax bill, with HMRC. So he was negotiating with his own department as their boss. Clear conflict of interest. And second thing is his attempts to deny claims that he wasn't being investigated by HMRC and attempts to shut down this Incredibly active ex Clifford Chance tax lawyer. Dan Needle. Dan Needle. Yep. And then the final thing is, If you're gonna go, go quickly. If he'd gone absolutely immediately as soon as this came out, he would have had a chance potentially of coming back as a minister. People like Peter Mandelson, Abba Rudd, many others have resigned and come back. But if you try to cling on so long that you're eventually sacked, you damage your career in a way that it's very difficult to come back from. Although yesterday, number 10, apparently, at their briefing, said that, Rishi Sunak didn't rule him out coming back. I think the problem here is that Rishi Sunak is I can't work out whether he's if he feels weakened by these various factions around him Or whether actually he doesn't really have a kind of a political impulse that tells him instinctively where Things are going to end. I did an interview for the BBC about 2 weeks before Zohar Zoharwe eventually went. And they said, you know, what advice should you give, to Sunak? And I said, work out where you think is going to end and get there first. And it was obvious. I I think it was obvious to everybody that you couldn't possibly justify what Zahawi had done and the way he was defending himself. And I also think it was interesting how Zahawi's letter of resignation, there was no apology. There was no acceptance of the the findings of the report that Sunak had Based his decision to sack him upon by Laurie Magnus, the ethics adviser. And there was this rather sort of, I thought, rather pathetic bleat about Some of the coverage. That too, I think, probably damaged him, but he clearly thinks I mean, you probably know better than I do what the sort of various factions are around this, But I think he felt that Sunak was maybe too weak to sack him, and he needed the ammunition of that report. One thing to give a bit of Credit to Sunak as opposed to Boris Johnson is that when we spoke last week, we were talking as though the waiting for the Magnus report would be Exactly what Boris Johnson was always doing, which was trying to sort of buy 2 or 3 months in order Yeah. To hope that it went down. And, actually, to the credit of The ethics adviser, Rishi Sunak, that report came out very quickly, delivered on a Sunday, totally unambiguous, Actually, quite clearly written well written by Lauren Agnes, and Nadim Sahabi was fired on Sunday. But you're absolutely right that there was no reason to wait for that report or commission that report. And in a way, it indicates maybe what you're pointing to, which is, questions about political antennae. I think you'd probably say, just from a political point of view, either get rid of the person immediately Or, and we disapprove of this deeply, but I guess if you're being Machiavellian and Boris Johnson like, you're using the report to try to brush the thing under the carpet for 4 months. But This, in a sense, is the worst of all worlds, which is that you just get another 6 days of being hammered in the media, and then you do what everyone knew you were gonna do anyway. Richie Soon, I got the political pain or shared the political pain with Nadim Zahawi, but he got none of the credit. There's no he got no credit back in the in the reputational bank. Again, we said this, I think, 2 weeks in a row, for him to stand up at the prime minister's questions as he did when the story was first really kind of Taking getting hold in the political psyche, as it were, and the political debate, he said that Nadim Zahawi dealt with it and all the questions were answered, and and that It simply was not the case. And, you know, you've gotta be very, very careful in those situations. If you're the prime minister, these words, They get noticed more because you're the prime minister. You know, professionalism, integrity, accountability, he deliberately made that a big thing, And that means that he's you know, I think there may be lesser scandals now, will become bigger scandals because of that. It's a little bit like John Major with his back to basics. Now poor old John Major, it got completely sort of, you know, twisted against him and not not least by us, and and certainly by parts of the media. But I think John Major's sort of saying back to basics and family values and and all that stuff. And then Every small scandal became a big scandal. Every big scandal became a huge scandal. And I think anything now to do with Financial impropriety within the conservative party in the cabinet is gonna be a real problem for Ricci sooner. It is a big problem, and yet The tragedy of the thing is that I think he genuinely is a better person than Boris Johnson. He's trying harder. He wasn't trying to use that report just To buy himself 3 months and rush it under the carpet. I agree with I agree with that. But you're right. He's mishandled it. A couple of things, Anastar, which I think be interesting to hear from you on. One of them is just this question of how you get the judgment call right on when to act and when not. I remember when I was, An MP and got myself in trouble in my constituency in my 1st few months, because I'd said to a journalist from The Sun, that were people in my deficiency who held their trousers up with twine. And I went to talk to your successor, in in number 10. The story at the time was that they had to calculate whether the story would go away within 3 days or not. And if The story went away in a couple of days. They would try to bluff it out. And if they thought that it was gonna continue for much more than 3 days, The tendency was to try to force someone to resign and throw them under the under the bus. Does does that does that resonate with you? Is that the way you thought about it, or do you think about it in a different way? Oh my lord. I'm I'm amazed that that one even got to that level. Who who was that? Was that Craig Oliver? No. No. No. It was the, it was the man who went To jail eventually for, Oh, Andy Coulson. Andy Coulson. Yeah. Andy Coulson. Oh my lord. So yours your thing about the farmers with twine I think I think to be fair, Andy Coulson was not very interested in the subject. I think it was me as a neurotic anxious Were you getting a bit paranoid? Getting paranoid and going to see him. No. I think he wasn't Very interesting. He gave me about 5 minutes of his time. I'd have been very surprised at that. So and did it run for 3 days, or didn't it sort of go away? No. I think, Andy, to his credit. Probably worked out. This is gonna blow over. These little guys are really clearly a bit worried. I'm just gonna patronize him a bit, Then it'll go away. And then I'll go tell David Cameron, my god. That Rory Stewart. He's a bit sort of wooly, isn't he? Anyway, tell me about this this. How how do you work out when you can sort of tough it out And get behind your minister, and it's gonna be okay. I I guess you would have thought about this, weren't you, when Peter Mandelson got in trouble? You would have had to calculate, Is this gonna blow over? Can we stick by him because Tony Blair cared about him, would have wanted to keep him, or are we gonna have to encourage him to go? Was that an example? Well, I mean, there there are quite a few. I and the the Peter Mandelson one is sort of you know, is quite painful in lots of different ways. I I think on the 2nd resignation in particular, that we were probably driven more than we should have been by this sort of noise and the a frenzy. Particularly, I think I thought I felt this a lot during the Johnson era where there were Scandals far worse than anything Peter was alleged to have done, which didn't seem to get any level of frenzy at all. So that that would have been one definitely where I think we were being pressured by the noise and by the frenzy. I think with other ones, it was much clearer. I remember, I can't remember if we talked before about Ron Davis, the world secretary, when he was, arrested on well, the police picked him up after he'd gone for a a walk on Clapham Common, and and when he came in to try to playing what had happened. I can remember the look in Tony's eyes. Tony kept sort of just looking over to me with this look that said, I've already made my mind up. And you didn't need to sort of linger too long on that. And and Ron was gone by the end of the day. So it depends, I think, on, I guess, the the the the personal and the political value of the minister, definitely important. I don't think it is really about the media. I think it's about what you feel deep down, whether you think this is right or wrong, what's Happened as right or wrong. I think that does come into it in a big way. Question, Alastair, I think also which was relevant to you. I mean, as you say, it's very painful. I don't wanna drag over Peter Mallinson because he's a A friend of yours. But but to remind listeners, he resigned twice, and the 2nd time was over his role in brokering a British passport for donors to Millennium Dome. And the thing that at least in the in the Guardian reporting at the time, They said that in an hour long meeting, Tony Blair discussed why the media and Alastair Campbell and ministers were misled for 48 hours about mister Mandelson's phone call to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister, in June 1998. So I think that's something that you also raised in some of these other resignations, which As as a communications director, you wanted to know the facts, and you got very, very angry if you felt people weren't being straight with you on what had happened. That's what I think Rishi Sunak didn't do in relation to Zahawi. You've got to demand the facts, and you've got to try to get the facts. And it's in that process That I think sometimes, yes, confusion can happen, muddle can take place, but also a sense can develop that you're not getting the full picture here. And is there a reason for that? And that might might color your assessment at the time. I think that the other thing that is important here is the sort of leadership and the relationships of trust. So I can remember, for example, with Robin Cook, The very the first big issue with Robin Cook when there was the whole the story about him having an affair with his, with with a member of his team, and, the mythology was that I told him you have to choose between your wife and your mistress. It wasn't like that at all. However, there was a judgment to be made about whether this mattered sufficiently. And that was a point where the value of the minister, if you like, was a factor. Tony did not want to lose Robin Cook. Was it also that you felt by that stage that British life was also changing and that somebody having an affair, which was Considered a really big problem back in the eighties by the nineties was something that you were beginning to feel this is more to do with somebody's Personal private life, and it's less relevant. I mean, if I go back to where I began, the thing that I think ministers should resign over is is conflict of interest. Yep. And corruption. And a and an affair isn't isn't about corruption or conflict of interest? Well, it could be. It could be depending upon who it was. If you're having an affair with a with a Russian agent. That would be a bit of a problem. Like mister Profimo? Indeed. Indeed. I mean, I don't think it wasn't it was Problem because it was going to be a problem because the newspapers were going to go big on it. And, indeed, The News of the World did go big on it. And and but by that time, Robin was clear that as far as he was concerned, his marriage was over. I had said to him that it's Utterly up to you what you decide to do. The this is what got mangled afterwards. I said to him, but my advice in this situation is clarity. In other words, you have to be clear what you are going to do and what you're going to say about it. And he slept on it and came back the next day and said, I'm going to leave my wife and and and move in with Gaynor. But I think where you're right, I think it wasn't that maybe the culture had changed, But I think the other thing that that we were quite keen to do was not, as it were, on the first, as it were, back to basics, family values scandal that hit the new government to say we're gonna throw him overboard for the press. So so that's that's a difficult judgment call because sometimes, Like the awful Boris Johnson. Just by toughing it out, he almost got away with surviving scandals, which He got away with a lot of scandals. Yes. A lot. And so I I wonder whether somewhere in what Rishi Sunak's struggling with in the culture of the conservative party is that Nadim Zahawi, who'd been part of those Boris Johnson governments and seen Boris just defending ministers through thick and thin, refusing to resign himself, refusing to let anyone resign, was still living in a culture where He was used to that Boris culture. Just tough it out, ignore it, pay no attention whatsoever. Yeah. I I I I but I think that's what That's the influence of Johnson as he corrupted the whole lot of them in terms of what they thought was acceptable and what wasn't. I find it mind blowing that anybody can think that that was not an immediate clear conflict of interest. And, clearly, Laurie Magnus did. I mean, when you read his report, as you say, it's very it's brutally clear. And I'm really pleased in a way that that's something Rishi Sunak did and brought somebody back. You remember Boris Johnson, having transferred 2 ethics advisers, resigned, which You would have thought would lead to the resignation of the prime minister. Right? And then he decided he didn't need an ethics adviser anymore. Liz Truss said that she had such a good understanding of ethics that she didn't need to be advised on it. Shame that the same couldn't be said about her her handling of the economy. So I I do think it weakens Rishi Sunak, and I guess it is. I mean, it's a 100 days, and I know We're less focused on the 100 days thing in the UK than maybe the states where it's a big thing, you know, the president's 1st 100 days. But what was your what's your what's your overall assessment of of Rishi Sunak's 1st 100 days? Well, I think on on the plus side, he's He's a big improvement on Boris Johnson in this trust. I think he's somebody who, a bit like John Major, could well, After his political career, have a sort of position in public life and a respect which I don't think Boris Johnson's trust will ever pertain. I I notice with my colleagues Friends that they are much more comfortable working with him and in his cabinet. They they like the fact that he delegates. He Trust them. They think he's serious and professional, does his job well. But I think as you've said, he is struggling to project outwards And do the big public leadership there. I think he seems to be a hardworking, serious internal manager, but Politics, ultimately, particularly in a crisis and my goodness, the UK is in a crisis. As as you're gonna remind us, the IMF's just announced that the UK is gonna be the only Major economy that's going into recession this year. And what he's so far failing to do is do the really big businesses saying, Yep. We're in a mess. Yes. It's partly our fault. It's not entirely our fault. There are other things going on in the world, and this is the path out of it. Come with me, and and that that we're not yet feeling. Mhmm. And, I mean, I also think he's being further deliberately weakened by, Boris Johnson constantly just trying to be on maneuvers, Get himself noticed. I thought that story yesterday I mean, I know he's got a number of client journalist friends still in the media, but That utter bilge about Putin threatened to kill him by sending a missile, I mean, utter total crap. And some of the journalists yesterday, They produced the briefing note that number 10 had done on that specific call, which was all about how they agreed to keep in touch And, you know, the president Putin was pleased that the prime minister you know, I mean, all this rubbish. And it's just like but it's done deliberately, I think, to show You know, I can still get noticed. I can still get a message. I still know how to manipulate the media in a way that Rishi doesn't. He's our one of of the Sitting MPs, he's the 1 guy who's part of that real populist tradition. And one of the things that your friend Moses Naeem, the the man of Populism post truth and polarization points out in his book is that one element of these populist leaders, particularly in Latin America, is that they do separate themselves that that from their parties. They're able to be individuals. He he points out Fukimori in Peru was Example of this, and that's what Boris Johnson is trying to be. He's trying to be still the big figure, the big charismatic figure who can somehow Transcend the fact that he's on the backbenches, and there's almost nobody else who could do that. Many others threatened to do that. I mean, every time that Michael Gove was removed from office. He would definitely cause trouble for prime ministers, but Boris Johnson does it on a different scale. You know, he's got Jacob Reesemold out there saying he should be chairman of the conservative party b. He's doing visits to Ukraine. He says he's standing again. And the story, obviously, in a year's time that he's gonna put out is he's gonna be the only person who can win the conservatives. The election will be the story. Well, yeah, I think he's absolutely wrong about that. I think it'd be the absolute death throws for them if they brought him back, but there we are. I do think, by the way, one thing that Sunak could do that would indicate strength And would also be the right thing to do would have actually, if he were to announce that this whole business of Johnson and Truss having resignation honors, given that they both basically left office in disgrace that he just says it's not happening. Because they have to be agreed by by number 10. So if he were just to say that now it would be, as it were, a declaration of Johnson Mercier is a declaration of war. But given that Johnson is effectively spending most of his time waking up and thinking, how can I make Soonat's life more difficult today? I I think he's gonna need to take it on. It's a bit like Keir Starmer's done with Jeremy Corbyn. It's a I yeah. It's that's a tough call because the the problem is once you start doing that, You have the possibility, which we've never had in British politics, of when a new government comes in, when Labour takes over from the Conservatives refusing to Except the resignation of But there shouldn't be. What is the point of these resignation on us? Well, you you hate the whole system, don't you? Yes. Well, I particularly hate that because it's I do hate the whole system, but it's like, you know, particularly in the hands of somebody like Johnson, I just you know it's going to be his mates, the people he's made promises to, the donors, the people whose houses he lives in. You know? He he's just so sorted, and the it's not as if the House of Lords currently has a great reputation, Rory. Anyway, I think Souna, he he's probably too weak to do it, And I don't mean that as a as a character assessment. I mean, politically, he's probably too weak to do it. But I really do think that would be a good thing for him to do. Did you do a resignation letter, or did you just I did do a resignation letter. I did a resignation letter sent to Theresa May saying that I would not be prepared to serve in Boris Johnson's cabinet. It was coordinated. So I did it with 3 of us did it. Philip Hammond, who was the chancellor, the exchequer, David Gook, who was the lord chancellor, and myself were the 3 Cabinet ministers who decided to resign before before Boris Johnson came in. And did you get a nice reply? Yep. Got a nice very nice reply from Theresa May. Have you framed it? Is it on your toilet wall? Actually, no. I I'm afraid of it put on my toilet wall. No. I'm worried I've actually lost it, To be honest, I don't even know what it is. You can't do that. When, when we we're talking about Robin Cook, I can remember, when he finally resigned, which is It was obviously over Iraq, and he was common's leader by then. And Robin and I had about half a dozen meetings To go over the exact wording, both of his letter and of Tony's. Now there were other resignations where, You know, it didn't require that level of of input, but the the it was going to be such a big a big sort of issue when he resigned. And Robin Robin was very, very grown up about it. He didn't want to yeah. I remember him saying, I'd look. I'm resigning because I can't support the policy, But I don't want to make life any more difficult for Tony. I don't want to just become a sort of, you know, serial rebel. So we had this this sort of you know? And he drafted something and and and I drafted something, and and we sort of I remember sitting there, and And I I drafted something for him where I talked about, you know, how proud he was about his role in the Kosovo conflict and And and the and the military action, we took it sincerely owed and all this. And and he said at one point, he said, do you think you could focus a little less on my war record And a little more a little more about ethical foreign policy. And so and so but, eventually, we sort of you know, we we battered it backwards forwards. And, obviously, Tony was seeing these drafts. And, eventually, we got to a place where, you know, obviously, the fact of his resignation was was huge news. But then you got a sense from the letters of there was a sort of a mutual respect, and Robin very, very clear that, you know, he understands the decision. He understands why Tony Blair wants to make that decision, but he can't support it. And he's reached the point where he can't stay in the government. And I think that's a big test, isn't it, whether whether they're still on-site or not? I mean, obviously, the the resignation letter I was sending in against Boris Johnson was not being negotiated with anybody. It was designed to hit Boris Johnson, and that was true for the people who resigned at the end of his time when they were trying to bring him down. That def those definitely wouldn't have been negotiated with number 10. Now you mentioned, you mentioned Jacob Rees Mogg there. I'm doing we're we're recording this on Tuesday morning. I'm doing Tuesday evening. This evening, I'm doing a Radio 4 debate, Live debate on Brexit 3 years on. So 2 questions, Rory. I've done several debates with Jacob Rees Mogg. He's quite a tricky character to debate against because he is unbelievably slippery and gaslights par excellence, but he does it in that Is it an Etonian thing, Roy? Can I are there are there any kind of Etonian tricks you could maybe teach me that I could that I could use? Well, I think he's he's he His weapon is is not really Olbutonian. It's a kind of mad sort of anachronism. He's he's mainlining a sort Revision of a kind of Edwardian man. It's a sort of comic opera, excessive courtesy Yeah. Incredibly polite language, never getting flustered. No. It it's it is it's a very particular style. If you were really, really bored, my greatest debate against Jacob Rees Mogg was in the House of Commons where I defended the European, Human Rights Act against him in a in a debate of an hour and 15 minutes, just the 2 of us going at each other in the House of Commons On a really boring, boring evening. I I once said to you, I was in Brixton once, and I was stopped by a British Nigerian man who owned a hair extension shop who said to me, That debate between you and Jacob Rees Mogg on human rights is the best thing I'd ever watched. Did you win the debate? Well, actually, there wasn't any votes at the end of it. So there's no way But did you feel you won it? I felt I won it, but but Matthew Paris, who's normally a fan of Mine then came out and, I think, read an article saying he thought Jake Rees Mogg had bested me. Oh, right. So what's your tip? Give me a tip. So I think you want to Make the audience see what he's doing, expose it. So I think you might want to say, Jacob, I know what you're gonna do here. You're gonna be awfully courteous polite and use some very fancy language. And I I know what you're gonna say is that, you know, there are still opportunities for Brexit, So sort of spike his guns before he does it. I know that he's going to say that because of Brexit, we managed to do the vaccine rollout, and the money for the health services have already been given, both of which are total lies. Yeah. I think that's Yeah. I think that's not a bad tip, but a preemptive rebuttal. Good. Well, let's on on that, let's take a break, and we'll return to Israel and the Gorno Karabakh. Welcome back to the rest of politics with me, Alastair Campbell. And with and with me me, Rory Stewart. I Alastair was about to say with me, Alastair Campbell, me, Rory Stewart. Listen, Alastair, I really, really enjoyed talking to your friend and my hero, Alan Milburn, on the rest of his politics leading, I think the best interview we've done. Oh, it's partly my theory that it's great getting someone who's no longer an active politician. It'd be a bit more honest and open. But I also thought he was really challenging. He's very, very proud of Labour. He's very bright, but he was also pretty brutally clear about the fact that he could He was still proud of many things that are controversial. PFI's in the National Health Service, bringing private sector in to work in the National Health Service, And his absolute belief that markets were necessary to improve the performance of the NHS. Controlled markets. Controlled markets. Yeah. Yeah. I thought that that that you weren't alone, by the way. I mean, I was looking, Rest is Politics Twitter feed, put out the links to the to the podcast. And this morning before I went swimming, I was just having a look at some of the replies. And, you know, we get pretty positive stuff in the main, even on Twitter in response to our podcast. But, honestly, it was like a I actually sent it to Alan this morning. I said, listen. This is a love in. There was a little bit about, you know, people criticizing for marketization, PFI, etcetera. There were the kind of few sort of, you know, left at wing of the Labour Party criticism. But in the main, it was, honestly, it was it was like it really was like a kind of, you know, wow. This guy was amazing, which, Now I've known Alan for a long time, and and I just thought that was him being him. Well, there's something really important here, which is that I think it was a glimpse of what made New Labour so strongly appealing. I I said in the interview that for for someone like me to vote Labour, I want to hear people who sound like Alan Milburn. And that's, of course, what Tony Blair delivered in 97. And I'm sure that many of our listeners are from the political center, and they are worried that They're not getting enough courage and clarity out of Labour. And it was wonderful maybe for people to hear somebody who's Unimpeachably, Labour proud of Labour's record, but is also very happy to acknowledge that there are things that make sense about the market. The PFIs and the private sector being involved in health isn't necessarily a bad thing, but reform is important. And and just tonally, I thought he was he was respectful towards Rishi Sunak, which we don't hear often. And all of that, oddly, would be what would convince, I think, me and many people like me to vote for Labour. Although he he also did say he felt that West Breeding Was very much not part of the Mingvaz strategy as he described it. I also like the fact that, I mean, obviously, I know Alan's backstory. I know his about his childhood and his upbringing. I hadn't realized that he'd sort of felt he couldn't talk about that when he was a politician. Yeah. And I'm thinking that's because, actually, maybe he I don't know whether there was a slight sort of sense of, well, if you're coming from this poor background, You either look like you're trying to use it or you're giving you're giving the sense that, you know, you're not really you're not really made for this. So I think he came across very, very authentic. And for those who haven't heard Rory Stewart's hero, his word, not mine, Alan Millburn, Just search leading, that's the word single word, leading wherever you get your podcasts. Now should we turn abroad? Let's turn abroad. So Israel Palestine, should we start with that? Well, there's old Antony Blinken, secretary of state, Going he saw Netanyahu yesterday, is off to see Mahmoud Abbas today. And I really feel for the guy because, I mean, how many times can you sort of go there and say, we're absolutely committed to the two state solution, and we call on both parties to blah dee, blah dee, blah dee, blah? And this is the reality of what's happened, I think, in you know, it's fair to say there are they can you can point defaults on both sides, But that government that you've now got in and and obviously what happened with the the killings at the weekend was horrific, but you now have and you knew this was going to happen because of just how right wing the Israeli government now is. There was only ever going to be a security response. Is it is it worthwhile just to make I as you say, we've got very sophisticated listeners, but Shall I shall I just try to give a because I'm speaking to you from Jordan Yeah. Very close to the to the Palestinian border. Just to remind people a little bit about The way in which at least Palestinians and Jordanians perceive this. So I think just to remind people of the very, very basic things, which is State of Israel emerged in 1948. And for many Palestinians, even the territory that Israel captured in 1948 involved them being displaced from their homes, and they still regard that as an occupation. That's not the way the international community Regards it. But the international community is focused on what happened in 1967, which was the 6 day war, where Israel basically, in 6 days, defeated Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, Took the Golan Heights, took the West Bank, which was previously controlled by Jordan. And it's from then onwards that we really have the deep sense of the international community saying, this territory is occupied Palestinian territory. It should not belong to Israel. And a debate within Israel, which used to be much fierce than it is today between Liberals saying we don't need this territory conservatives saying this territory is vital for Israeli national security. And that debate actually is my last visit To to Israel, I got a sense that, actually, the Israeli Liberals are less strong than they were, that a new generation has emerged, that people are less Interest in making the case for the two stage solution. And this brings us to the final thing, which is what's at the heart of what we're dealing with now, which is that we came out of these agreements. People would have heard of the Oso Accords, would have heard of Camp David, which was an attempt again to do it in 2000. And this divided The territory Palestinian territory into areas a, b, and c. Broadly speaking, area a was the areas which were absolutely Palestinian, b were ambiguous, and see where areas where there were Israeli settlements. And Israeli settlements are 400,000 Israelis who have built Villages, in some cases, towns or even cities, and over a 100 of them are completely informal things where they just push out, take a piece of territory In the middle of what the Palestinians do with their territory. So while the Palestinians have these scraps of territory, I think they've got A 166 separate little entities. And when I was traveling through Palestine, you're going through checkpoints all the time. You're driving down essentially tunnels with Breeze block on either side to try to get to somewhere like Nablus. And I I think understanding this or trying to understand it From these 2 points of view is essential, but I think quite difficult to articulate because even when I'm talking to you now, I'm aware that there will be many listeners on both sides Saying what an outrageous way of characterizing the conflict. I think that's pretty fair. And and and, also, it's it's gone on now for for decades with various Points at which you mentioned Oslo. You mentioned Camp David. I can remember when Tony Blair went to the Middle East not long after we'd done the Good Friday Agreement. And I'm not linking the 2. I'm simply saying that at that time, there felt like this could happen. It felt like something was really moving. But unless you have, particularly the Americans, but the international community more broadly, Really, really focused on this and really, really trying on to port every single lever that's available to you, then it just sort of it just It feels like it evaporates. And I watched Blinken with with Netanyahu yesterday, and I think Blinken's a pretty impressive Secretary of state, I think Biden, like previous American presidents, really does feel a sense of responsibility because The American power there really matters. But that and that relationship with the Israelis is incredibly strong, But it sort of I I kinda felt blinking. It felt to me like he was slightly going through the motions. 100%. And and that's I think you put your finger on it, Alastair, and I think it's actually unspoken policy now, Washington, that this is not going to be their issue, That Biden has signalled that Israel Power sign is not what this administration's concentrating on, and so they will continue saying That they call on all sides to show restraint. They will continue to use all the old language, their unconditional support for Israel. They'll keep the three At $8,000,000,000 a year, which US provides in support for Israel, you'll notice Blinken didn't mention the settlements, in his in his speech, but I don't get the impression that this is something they're gonna be leaning into or trying to resolve. And in the absence of that, the truth is that many of the people around The new Israeli prime minister, Rabi, are gonna be pushing hard to extend those settlements further, to reinforce them, to connect with roads, To put the whole Social Security system behind them to get electricity into them. Mhmm. And, of course, Ben Gavir, who's the national security adviser now or the the head of national department minister has just again made a very provocative visit to the Temple Mount, to the Haram and Sharif. I thought also it was the the The Palestinian who committed that atrocity at the at the weekend, when I saw the Israeli Defense forces then being filmed by themselves and releasing the film of them going in to effectively demolish the house where he came from and and kick out his family. His father there saying he had no idea this was happening. And I just think and and and the response has been one of, as I say, security, security, security, which I get from the kind of mindset. But at the same time, in terms it feels like you're pushing The idea of any kind of solution further and further away. And the other thing which I think Blinken did raise and I think was right to raise is the Americans' worries that they have about the the the the new government's determination to do something about the independence of the judiciary. Absolutely. And then then just to put the Point of view from from the other point of view, I mean, it's this is incredibly presumptuous of me because I'm not in the middle of this, but I also, have traveled around Israel with Israeli friends who feel so strongly the threat. Mhmm. They they they feel threatened. The way that they perceive this is that they are facing an existential challenge, that they need to control this territory in order to, guarantee the survival of of Israel as it exists. And also that the tragedy of the last few years Is that there's so little interaction now between Israelis and Palestinian communities. I I remember that when I visited 25 years ago, you could drive very comfortably from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, and many Israelis would would visit Bethlehem. And now there are big signs are put up by the Israeli government saying do not enter this territory. You could be a danger of your life. And so Bethlehem, which is a very, peaceful part of Palestine, I mean, there there are more tricky bits, sitting here on Nablus may be a bit trickier, But even the most peaceful bits are now perceived. Bits just a few miles outside Jerusalem are perceived as being these very hostile alien territories, and you you get the sense that There's so little understanding now about different people's experiences and cultures. The trips I did with with Tony, the other thing you when when you Go from one to the other. You do really, really do have this strong sense of going from, to use the old language, you know, the 1st world to the 3rd world, literally the moment you crossed the border. I can remember 1 visit where I think yes Sharon was prime minister. And to this day, I don't know where we were driven, but I I the security around me was just extraordinary. We'd driven into this sort of, It felt like a garage in a Lyft. And we drive in and it it honestly, it was like I said that with James Bondenfeld. We drive in and the car stops, And then we sort of the car goes up in a lift, and then we come out at a different place. And then suddenly, we're in Sherrod's house. And then you cross the border, so you've got all that. And then you cross the border, and we and we had I remember having this meeting with with Yasser Arafat just over the border. You felt you'd suddenly gone to a A very poor country from a very wealthy country. And that, I think, further exacerbates this sense of divisions that can't be bridged. Let let's let's move on to the thing that you, I think, were quite right to raise and almost nobody talks about, which is what's happening now in Nagorno Karabakh, Which is this disputed territory between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Tell us a little bit about why you wanted to talk about that. Well, I've I've been I've been talking to to people, particularly on the the Armenian government side. And I think it is one of those situations where It just gets it gets no kind of real it doesn't really get any coverage at all in in in large parts of the of the media, but it's an incredibly Important story for lots and lots of different reasons. I mean, just what so wind back to when the Soviet Union collapsed in the early nineties. You had ethnic Armenian separatists in this area, Karabakh, who broke away from Azerbaijan. There was a war, estimated 30,000 lives lost. Then there was a peace process that's been going on since 1990 four. But then there was a new war started in 2020. So 2025 years later, which is interesting, is it? The answer is yes. It's 20 it flares up. I don't know about the Azerbaijan side, but I think there were 5,000 Armenians killed in that. Armenia was then forced to return Occupied territories around Nagorno Karabakh. So now Nagorno Karabakh is landlocked inside Armenia Yep. But disputed. And it's governed by some something called the NKR, which is Nagorno Karabakh Republic. Russia has sent this billionaire to kind of be the sort of The overlord as it were. And you have if you look at if you look at it on a map, Nagorno Karabakh, which is It's relatively small. It's about 1700 square miles and and very kind of agricultural, very rural, very foresty. Yep. Population, Roughly a 120,000, so quite small numbers of people. But because it's landlocked, to go from Armenia to Gorno Karabakh, you have to cross about 20 kilometers of Azerbaijan. Yep. And this protest has now started, and it's a protest that is clearly organized by the Azerbaijan government. Yep. But it's a it's reportedly protesting a gold mining that's going on inside, inside the Gorno Karabakh. And what it means is that There's apart from some traffic from the Red Cross, you can't get in and out. And they say they are saying that within the Gorno Karabakh Now there's a humanitarian crisis. But meanwhile, you have all this geopolitical stuff going on around it. So I think that's a brilliant description of it. And and, actually, Azerbaijan itself is also split into different bits. There's a bit called Nakijaban, which is again separate. This is the other side of Armenia. Yeah. Traveling through Armenian territory to get to. Yeah. So to take listen back to the real basics. Armenia, oldest Christian state in the world, 1st 1st country to convert to Christianity. Azerbaijan, predominantly Muslim and related very closely, linguistically, culturally, to Turkey. And as you say, it's become a real center for geoconflict. So the War in the nineties saw the Armenians essentially win in Nagorno Karabakh and kick out 600,000 to a1000000 Azerbaijanis. And then 25 years later, Azerbaijan came back the other way. And when Azerbaijan came back the other way, which was, as you say, 2020, And they came back this time supported very strongly by Turkey that provided them with drones. Turkish f sixteens landed on Azerbaijani airfields, and they won this victory that essentially took back a lot of the territory and kicked out a lot of Armenians. And the Russians Got a lot of credit in 2020. This was pre the invasion of Crimea for soft power and diplomacy and sending in a couple of 1,000 troops And seeming to police a ceasefire and keep everything going. And they're still there. And they're still there. But as you've pointed out, they've completely failed to respond to this blockade, which is effectively strangling the Armenian population of Gorakharek. And the question is, why are they not responding? And it seems as though Russia's power is ebbing. And probably it's that Putin now needs to keep Turkey on side because he's got So few friends out there in the world that he's not prepared to have this fight anymore. The other the other relatively new factor is that the European Union has now got involved and has sent this mission, civilian mission, to monitor the border, which Moscow has now said is a a terrible provocation, one of their favorite words, And the Americans, Blinken talking of Blinken again, Blinken has expressed support for the European Union taking an interest. And if you look at You look at the map, you've got Turkey, you've got Iran, on one of the other borders. The Armenians say the Pakistanis are getting involved, and getting engaged. And you talked about the the this this where they got the support from Turkey in the previous war. They now have Support from Israel in terms of drones where there's a bit of a sort of deal going on for, you know, drones and oil supplies. Wise. And, of course, the and the British just to throw in a a slight British element in the air, of course, one of the biggest players inside Azerbaijan is BP. Absolutely. Because Azerbaijan, unlike Armenia, is the big oil and gas hub of the region, and that's one of the reasons they've been able to fund this over the 25 years, build up their armed forces to recapture. Maybe in another episode, the story of what's happening to all these states that were part of the former Soviet Union around the fringe of Russia And their in particularly in Central Asia and in the Caucasus, their failure, really, to make the transition to liberal democracies, the ways in which Russia has continued to bail out dictators in from Belarus all the way through to Kazakhstan. And these the strange nature of the rule of Aliyev in Azerbaijan or indeed his quote in Armenia. I think the this is this is good stuff because this is right at the center of what's happening in the in what we publicly call the global order. Yeah. Absolutely. And and and and it is it is interesting how in this one, For example, the the Ukraine seems to side much more with Azerbaijan. Oh, wow. I wasn't expecting that. There was, an interview recently with one of Zelensky's key people who said that The essentially, he was saying that the whole thing is being whipped up, by the Armenians, possibly by the Russians as well, but to take attention away from Ukraine. Oh goodness. And essentially saying that this one doesn't really matter that much. Gosh. When you would have thought their natural in sync sale literature. Yeah. Okay. Well, lot more to be discussed. Thank you for raising Nagorno Karabakh. Alastair, without you, we would not have. We definitely thought we got there. And I think maybe that brings us the end of this week's pod. I shall be off now to see your friend Jacob Rees Mogg, your fellow atonian, and I shall do exactly as you said. I have my tactics prepared. Very good luck. Very well. I'm reaching for you. Bye bye.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nWelcome to another episode of The Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we're gonna talk about matters Nadim Zahawi, matters Richard Sharp, the BBC, and the Boris Johnson sleaze. We're gonna talk about Sunak more generally. How is he doing after his 1st 100 days? We're on the 3rd anniversary of the exit from the European Union. I suspect we may touch upon that.\n\nAnd I think we need to touch on the Middle East as well. And, also, Rory, I'm very keen to talk about Nagorno Karabakh. So your friend, Nadim Zahawi, I predicted he would go. He has gone, but he's gone in a way that I think has not just damaged him and his career, but I think he's damaged Rishi Sunak as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, I think the I agree. I think the lesson there are couple of lessons for this. One of them is the problem for politicians, and I think that Comes into conflict of interest and cover up. So I think when we look at people's finances and their income, the big The question is always around conflict of interest, and here, the clear conflict of interest was that he was the chancellor of the exchequer when he was negotiating his Own tax bill, with HMRC.\n\nSo he was negotiating with his own department as their boss. Clear conflict of interest. And second thing is his attempts to deny claims that he wasn't being investigated by HMRC and attempts to shut down this Incredibly active ex Clifford Chance tax lawyer.\n\nSpeaker 0: Dan Needle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Dan Needle. Yep. And then the final thing is, If you're gonna go, go quickly. If he'd gone absolutely immediately as soon as this came out, he would have had a chance potentially of coming back as a minister. People like Peter Mandelson, Abba Rudd, many others have resigned and come back.\n\nBut if you try to cling on so long that you're eventually sacked, you damage your career in a way that it's very difficult to come back from.\n\nSpeaker 0: Although yesterday, number 10, apparently, at their briefing, said that, Rishi Sunak didn't rule him out coming back. I think the problem here is that Rishi Sunak is I can't work out whether he's if he feels weakened by these various factions around him Or whether actually he doesn't really have a kind of a political impulse that tells him instinctively where Things are going to end. I did an interview for the BBC about 2 weeks before Zohar Zoharwe eventually went. And they said, you know, what advice should you give, to Sunak? And I said, work out where you think is going to end and get there first.\n\nAnd it was obvious. I I think it was obvious to everybody that you couldn't possibly justify what Zahawi had done and the way he was defending himself. And I also think it was interesting how Zahawi's letter of resignation, there was no apology. There was no acceptance of the the findings of the report that Sunak had Based his decision to sack him upon by Laurie Magnus, the ethics adviser. And there was this rather sort of, I thought, rather pathetic bleat about Some of the coverage.\n\nThat too, I think, probably damaged him, but he clearly thinks I mean, you probably know better than I do what the sort of various factions are around this, But I think he felt that Sunak was maybe too weak to sack him, and he needed the ammunition of that report.\n\nSpeaker 1: One thing to give a bit of Credit to Sunak as opposed to Boris Johnson is that when we spoke last week, we were talking as though the waiting for the Magnus report would be Exactly what Boris Johnson was always doing, which was trying to sort of buy 2 or 3 months in order Yeah. To hope that it went down. And, actually, to the credit of The ethics adviser, Rishi Sunak, that report came out very quickly, delivered on a Sunday, totally unambiguous, Actually, quite clearly written well written by Lauren Agnes, and Nadim Sahabi was fired on Sunday. But you're absolutely right that there was no reason to wait for that report or commission that report. And in a way, it indicates maybe what you're pointing to, which is, questions about political antennae.\n\nI think you'd probably say, just from a political point of view, either get rid of the person immediately Or, and we disapprove of this deeply, but I guess if you're being Machiavellian and Boris Johnson like, you're using the report to try to brush the thing under the carpet for 4 months. But This, in a sense, is the worst of all worlds, which is that you just get another 6 days of being hammered in the media, and then you do what everyone knew you were gonna do anyway.\n\nSpeaker 0: Richie Soon, I got the political pain or shared the political pain with Nadim Zahawi, but he got none of the credit. There's no he got no credit back in the in the reputational bank. Again, we said this, I think, 2 weeks in a row, for him to stand up at the prime minister's questions as he did when the story was first really kind of Taking getting hold in the political psyche, as it were, and the political debate, he said that Nadim Zahawi dealt with it and all the questions were answered, and and that It simply was not the case. And, you know, you've gotta be very, very careful in those situations. If you're the prime minister, these words, They get noticed more because you're the prime minister.\n\nYou know, professionalism, integrity, accountability, he deliberately made that a big thing, And that means that he's you know, I think there may be lesser scandals now, will become bigger scandals because of that. It's a little bit like John Major with his back to basics. Now poor old John Major, it got completely sort of, you know, twisted against him and not not least by us, and and certainly by parts of the media. But I think John Major's sort of saying back to basics and family values and and all that stuff. And then Every small scandal became a big scandal.\n\nEvery big scandal became a huge scandal. And I think anything now to do with Financial impropriety within the conservative party in the cabinet is gonna be a real problem for Ricci sooner.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is a big problem, and yet The tragedy of the thing is that I think he genuinely is a better person than Boris Johnson. He's trying harder. He wasn't trying to use that report just To buy himself 3 months and rush it under the carpet.\n\nSpeaker 0: I agree with I agree with that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you're right. He's mishandled it. A couple of things, Anastar, which I think be interesting to hear from you on. One of them is just this question of how you get the judgment call right on when to act and when not. I remember when I was, An MP and got myself in trouble in my constituency in my 1st few months, because I'd said to a journalist from The Sun, that were people in my deficiency who held their trousers up with twine.\n\nAnd I went to talk to your successor, in in number 10. The story at the time was that they had to calculate whether the story would go away within 3 days or not. And if The story went away in a couple of days. They would try to bluff it out. And if they thought that it was gonna continue for much more than 3 days, The tendency was to try to force someone to resign and throw them under the under the bus.\n\nDoes does that does that resonate with you? Is that the way you thought about it, or do you think about it in a different way?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh my lord. I'm I'm amazed that that one even got to that level. Who who was that? Was that Craig Oliver?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. No. It was the, it was the man who went To jail eventually for,\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, Andy Coulson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Andy Coulson. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Andy Coulson. Oh my lord. So yours your thing about the farmers with twine\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I think to be fair, Andy Coulson was not very interested in the subject. I think it was me as a neurotic anxious Were\n\nSpeaker 0: you getting a bit paranoid?\n\nSpeaker 1: Getting paranoid and going to see him. No. I think he wasn't Very interesting. He gave me about 5 minutes of his time.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'd have been very surprised at that. So and did it run for 3 days, or didn't it sort of go away? No. I think, Andy, to his credit. Probably worked out.\n\nThis is gonna blow over. These little guys are really clearly a bit worried. I'm just gonna patronize him a bit, Then it'll go away. And then I'll go tell David Cameron, my god. That Rory Stewart.\n\nHe's a bit sort of wooly, isn't he?\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, tell me about this this. How how do you work out when you can sort of tough it out And get behind your minister, and it's gonna be okay. I I guess you would have thought about this, weren't you, when Peter Mandelson got in trouble? You would have had to calculate, Is this gonna blow over? Can we stick by him because Tony Blair cared about him, would have wanted to keep him, or are we gonna have to encourage him to go?\n\nWas that an example?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I mean, there there are quite a few. I and the the Peter Mandelson one is sort of you know, is quite painful in lots of different ways. I I think on the 2nd resignation in particular, that we were probably driven more than we should have been by this sort of noise and the a frenzy. Particularly, I think I thought I felt this a lot during the Johnson era where there were Scandals far worse than anything Peter was alleged to have done, which didn't seem to get any level of frenzy at all. So that that would have been one definitely where I think we were being pressured by the noise and by the frenzy.\n\nI think with other ones, it was much clearer. I remember, I can't remember if we talked before about Ron Davis, the world secretary, when he was, arrested on well, the police picked him up after he'd gone for a a walk on Clapham Common, and and when he came in to try to playing what had happened. I can remember the look in Tony's eyes. Tony kept sort of just looking over to me with this look that said, I've already made my mind up. And you didn't need to sort of linger too long on that.\n\nAnd and Ron was gone by the end of the day. So it depends, I think, on, I guess, the the the the personal and the political value of the minister, definitely important. I don't think it is really about the media. I think it's about what you feel deep down, whether you think this is right or wrong, what's Happened as right or wrong. I think that does come into it in a big way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Question, Alastair, I think also which was relevant to you. I mean, as you say, it's very painful. I don't wanna drag over Peter Mallinson because he's a A friend of yours. But but to remind listeners, he resigned twice, and the 2nd time was over his role in brokering a British passport for donors to Millennium Dome. And the thing that at least in the in the Guardian reporting at the time, They said that in an hour long meeting, Tony Blair discussed why the media and Alastair Campbell and ministers were misled for 48 hours about mister Mandelson's phone call to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister, in June 1998.\n\nSo I think that's something that you also raised in some of these other resignations, which As as a communications director, you wanted to know the facts, and you got very, very angry if you felt people weren't being straight with you on what had happened.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's what I think Rishi Sunak didn't do in relation to Zahawi. You've got to demand the facts, and you've got to try to get the facts. And it's in that process That I think sometimes, yes, confusion can happen, muddle can take place, but also a sense can develop that you're not getting the full picture here. And is there a reason for that? And that might might color your assessment at the time.\n\nI think that the other thing that is important here is the sort of leadership and the relationships of trust. So I can remember, for example, with Robin Cook, The very the first big issue with Robin Cook when there was the whole the story about him having an affair with his, with with a member of his team, and, the mythology was that I told him you have to choose between your wife and your mistress. It wasn't like that at all. However, there was a judgment to be made about whether this mattered sufficiently. And that was a point where the value of the minister, if you like, was a factor.\n\nTony did not want to lose Robin Cook.\n\nSpeaker 1: Was it also that you felt by that stage that British life was also changing and that somebody having an affair, which was Considered a really big problem back in the eighties by the nineties was something that you were beginning to feel this is more to do with somebody's Personal private life, and it's less relevant. I mean, if I go back to where I began, the thing that I think ministers should resign over is is conflict of interest.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. And corruption.\n\nSpeaker 1: And a and an affair isn't isn't about corruption or conflict of interest?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it could be. It could be depending upon who it was. If you're having an affair with a with a Russian agent. That would be a bit of a problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: Like mister Profimo?\n\nSpeaker 0: Indeed. Indeed. I mean, I don't think it wasn't it was Problem because it was going to be a problem because the newspapers were going to go big on it. And, indeed, The News of the World did go big on it. And and but by that time, Robin was clear that as far as he was concerned, his marriage was over.\n\nI had said to him that it's Utterly up to you what you decide to do. The this is what got mangled afterwards. I said to him, but my advice in this situation is clarity. In other words, you have to be clear what you are going to do and what you're going to say about it. And he slept on it and came back the next day and said, I'm going to leave my wife and and and move in with Gaynor.\n\nBut I think where you're right, I think it wasn't that maybe the culture had changed, But I think the other thing that that we were quite keen to do was not, as it were, on the first, as it were, back to basics, family values scandal that hit the new government to say we're gonna throw him overboard for the press.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so that's that's a difficult judgment call because sometimes, Like the awful Boris Johnson. Just by toughing it out, he almost got away with surviving scandals, which He\n\nSpeaker 0: got away with a lot of scandals. Yes. A lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: And so I I wonder whether somewhere in what Rishi Sunak's struggling with in the culture of the conservative party is that Nadim Zahawi, who'd been part of those Boris Johnson governments and seen Boris just defending ministers through thick and thin, refusing to resign himself, refusing to let anyone resign, was still living in a culture where He was used to that Boris culture. Just tough it out, ignore it, pay no attention whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I I I I but I think that's what That's the influence of Johnson as he corrupted the whole lot of them in terms of what they thought was acceptable and what wasn't. I find it mind blowing that anybody can think that that was not an immediate clear conflict of interest. And, clearly, Laurie Magnus did. I mean, when you read his report, as you say, it's very it's brutally clear.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm really pleased in a way that that's something Rishi Sunak did and brought somebody back. You remember Boris Johnson, having transferred 2 ethics advisers, resigned, which You would have thought would lead to the resignation of the prime minister. Right? And then he decided he didn't need an ethics adviser anymore.\n\nSpeaker 0: Liz Truss said that she had such a good understanding of ethics that she didn't need to be advised on it. Shame that the same couldn't be said about her her handling of the economy. So I I do think it weakens Rishi Sunak, and I guess it is. I mean, it's a 100 days, and I know We're less focused on the 100 days thing in the UK than maybe the states where it's a big thing, you know, the president's 1st 100 days. But what was your what's your what's your overall assessment of of Rishi Sunak's 1st 100 days?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think on on the plus side, he's He's a big improvement on Boris Johnson in this trust. I think he's somebody who, a bit like John Major, could well, After his political career, have a sort of position in public life and a respect which I don't think Boris Johnson's trust will ever pertain. I I notice with my colleagues Friends that they are much more comfortable working with him and in his cabinet. They they like the fact that he delegates. He Trust them.\n\nThey think he's serious and professional, does his job well. But I think as you've said, he is struggling to project outwards And do the big public leadership there. I think he seems to be a hardworking, serious internal manager, but Politics, ultimately, particularly in a crisis and my goodness, the UK is in a crisis. As as you're gonna remind us, the IMF's just announced that the UK is gonna be the only Major economy that's going into recession this year. And what he's so far failing to do is do the really big businesses saying, Yep.\n\nWe're in a mess. Yes. It's partly our fault. It's not entirely our fault. There are other things going on in the world, and this is the path out of it.\n\nCome with me, and and that that we're not yet feeling.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. And, I mean, I also think he's being further deliberately weakened by, Boris Johnson constantly just trying to be on maneuvers, Get himself noticed. I thought that story yesterday I mean, I know he's got a number of client journalist friends still in the media, but That utter bilge about Putin threatened to kill him by sending a missile, I mean, utter total crap. And some of the journalists yesterday, They produced the briefing note that number 10 had done on that specific call, which was all about how they agreed to keep in touch And, you know, the president Putin was pleased that the prime minister you know, I mean, all this rubbish. And it's just like but it's done deliberately, I think, to show You know, I can still get noticed.\n\nI can still get a message. I still know how to manipulate the media in a way that Rishi doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's our one of of the Sitting MPs, he's the 1 guy who's part of that real populist tradition. And one of the things that your friend Moses Naeem, the the man of Populism post truth and polarization points out in his book is that one element of these populist leaders, particularly in Latin America, is that they do separate themselves that that from their parties. They're able to be individuals. He he points out Fukimori in Peru was Example of this, and that's what Boris Johnson is trying to be. He's trying to be still the big figure, the big charismatic figure who can somehow Transcend the fact that he's on the backbenches, and there's almost nobody else who could do that.\n\nMany others threatened to do that. I mean, every time that Michael Gove was removed from office. He would definitely cause trouble for prime ministers, but Boris Johnson does it on a different scale. You know, he's got Jacob Reesemold out there saying he should be chairman of the conservative party b. He's doing visits to Ukraine.\n\nHe says he's standing again. And the story, obviously, in a year's time that he's gonna put out is he's gonna be the only person who can win the conservatives. The election will be the story.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, yeah, I think he's absolutely wrong about that. I think it'd be the absolute death throws for them if they brought him back, but there we are. I do think, by the way, one thing that Sunak could do that would indicate strength And would also be the right thing to do would have actually, if he were to announce that this whole business of Johnson and Truss having resignation honors, given that they both basically left office in disgrace that he just says it's not happening. Because they have to be agreed by by number 10. So if he were just to say that now it would be, as it were, a declaration of Johnson Mercier is a declaration of war.\n\nBut given that Johnson is effectively spending most of his time waking up and thinking, how can I make Soonat's life more difficult today? I I think he's gonna need to take it on. It's a bit like Keir Starmer's done with Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a I yeah. It's that's a tough call because the the problem is once you start doing that, You have the possibility, which we've never had in British politics, of when a new government comes in, when Labour takes over from the Conservatives refusing to Except the resignation of\n\nSpeaker 0: But there shouldn't be. What is the point of these resignation on us?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you you hate the whole system, don't you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Well, I particularly hate that because it's I do hate the whole system, but it's like, you know, particularly in the hands of somebody like Johnson, I just you know it's going to be his mates, the people he's made promises to, the donors, the people whose houses he lives in. You know? He he's just so sorted, and the it's not as if the House of Lords currently has a great reputation, Rory. Anyway, I think Souna, he he's probably too weak to do it, And I don't mean that as a as a character assessment.\n\nI mean, politically, he's probably too weak to do it. But I really do think that would be a good thing for him to do. Did you do a resignation letter, or did you just\n\nSpeaker 1: I did do a resignation letter. I did a resignation letter sent to Theresa May saying that I would not be prepared to serve in Boris Johnson's cabinet. It was coordinated. So I did it with 3 of us did it. Philip Hammond, who was the chancellor, the exchequer, David Gook, who was the lord chancellor, and myself were the 3 Cabinet ministers who decided to resign before before Boris Johnson came in.\n\nSpeaker 0: And did you get a nice reply?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Got a nice very nice reply from Theresa May.\n\nSpeaker 0: Have you framed it? Is it on your toilet wall?\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, no. I I'm afraid of it put on my toilet wall. No. I'm worried I've actually lost it, To be honest, I don't even know\n\nSpeaker 0: what it is. You can't do that. When, when we we're talking about Robin Cook, I can remember, when he finally resigned, which is It was obviously over Iraq, and he was common's leader by then. And Robin and I had about half a dozen meetings To go over the exact wording, both of his letter and of Tony's. Now there were other resignations where, You know, it didn't require that level of of input, but the the it was going to be such a big a big sort of issue when he resigned.\n\nAnd Robin Robin was very, very grown up about it. He didn't want to yeah. I remember him saying, I'd look. I'm resigning because I can't support the policy, But I don't want to make life any more difficult for Tony. I don't want to just become a sort of, you know, serial rebel.\n\nSo we had this this sort of you know? And he drafted something and and and I drafted something, and and we sort of I remember sitting there, and And I I drafted something for him where I talked about, you know, how proud he was about his role in the Kosovo conflict and And and the and the military action, we took it sincerely owed and all this. And and he said at one point, he said, do you think you could focus a little less on my war record And a little more a little more about ethical foreign policy. And so and so but, eventually, we sort of you know, we we battered it backwards forwards. And, obviously, Tony was seeing these drafts.\n\nAnd, eventually, we got to a place where, you know, obviously, the fact of his resignation was was huge news. But then you got a sense from the letters of there was a sort of a mutual respect, and Robin very, very clear that, you know, he understands the decision. He understands why Tony Blair wants to make that decision, but he can't support it. And he's reached the point where he can't stay in the government.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I think that's a big test, isn't it, whether whether they're still on-site or not? I mean, obviously, the the resignation letter I was sending in against Boris Johnson was not being negotiated with anybody. It was designed to hit Boris Johnson, and that was true for the people who resigned at the end of his time when they were trying to bring him down. That def those definitely wouldn't have been negotiated with number 10.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now you mentioned, you mentioned Jacob Rees Mogg there. I'm doing we're we're recording this on Tuesday morning. I'm doing Tuesday evening. This evening, I'm doing a Radio 4 debate, Live debate on Brexit 3 years on. So 2 questions, Rory.\n\nI've done several debates with Jacob Rees Mogg. He's quite a tricky character to debate against because he is unbelievably slippery and gaslights par excellence, but he does it in that Is it an Etonian thing, Roy? Can I are there are there any kind of Etonian tricks you could maybe teach me that I could that I could use?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think he's he's he His weapon is is not really Olbutonian. It's a kind of mad sort of anachronism. He's he's mainlining a sort Revision of a kind of Edwardian man. It's a sort of comic opera, excessive courtesy Yeah. Incredibly polite language, never getting flustered.\n\nNo. It it's it is it's a very particular style. If you were really, really bored, my greatest debate against Jacob Rees Mogg was in the House of Commons where I defended the European, Human Rights Act against him in a in a debate of an hour and 15 minutes, just the 2 of us going at each other in the House of Commons On a really boring, boring evening. I I once said to you, I was in Brixton once, and I was stopped by a British Nigerian man who owned a hair extension shop who said to me, That debate between you and Jacob Rees Mogg on human rights is the best thing I'd ever watched.\n\nSpeaker 0: Did you win the debate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, actually, there wasn't any votes at the end of it. So there's no way\n\nSpeaker 0: But did you feel you won it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I felt I won it, but but Matthew Paris, who's normally a fan of Mine then came out and, I think, read an article saying he thought Jake Rees Mogg had bested me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, right. So what's your tip? Give me a tip.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think you want to Make the audience see what he's doing, expose it. So I think you might want to say, Jacob, I know what you're gonna do here. You're gonna be awfully courteous polite and use some very fancy language. And I I know what you're gonna say is that, you know, there are still opportunities for Brexit, So sort of spike his guns before he does it.\n\nSpeaker 0: I know that he's going to say that because of Brexit, we managed to do the vaccine rollout, and the money for the health services have already been given, both of which are total lies.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think that's Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think that's not a bad tip, but a preemptive rebuttal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Well, let's on on that, let's take a break, and we'll return to Israel and the Gorno Karabakh.\n\nSpeaker 0: Welcome back to the rest of politics with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with and with me me, Rory Stewart. I Alastair was about to say with me, Alastair Campbell, me, Rory Stewart. Listen, Alastair, I really, really enjoyed talking to your friend and my hero, Alan Milburn, on the rest of his politics leading, I think the best interview we've done. Oh, it's partly my theory that it's great getting someone who's no longer an active politician. It'd be a bit more honest and open.\n\nBut I also thought he was really challenging. He's very, very proud of Labour. He's very bright, but he was also pretty brutally clear about the fact that he could He was still proud of many things that are controversial. PFI's in the National Health Service, bringing private sector in to work in the National Health Service, And his absolute belief that markets were necessary to improve the performance of the NHS.\n\nSpeaker 0: Controlled markets.\n\nSpeaker 1: Controlled markets. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I thought that that that you weren't alone, by the way. I mean, I was looking, Rest is Politics Twitter feed, put out the links to the to the podcast. And this morning before I went swimming, I was just having a look at some of the replies. And, you know, we get pretty positive stuff in the main, even on Twitter in response to our podcast.\n\nBut, honestly, it was like a I actually sent it to Alan this morning. I said, listen. This is a love in. There was a little bit about, you know, people criticizing for marketization, PFI, etcetera. There were the kind of few sort of, you know, left at wing of the Labour Party criticism.\n\nBut in the main, it was, honestly, it was it was like it really was like a kind of, you know, wow. This guy was amazing, which, Now I've known Alan for a long time, and and I just thought that was him being him.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there's something really important here, which is that I think it was a glimpse of what made New Labour so strongly appealing. I I said in the interview that for for someone like me to vote Labour, I want to hear people who sound like Alan Milburn. And that's, of course, what Tony Blair delivered in 97. And I'm sure that many of our listeners are from the political center, and they are worried that They're not getting enough courage and clarity out of Labour. And it was wonderful maybe for people to hear somebody who's Unimpeachably, Labour proud of Labour's record, but is also very happy to acknowledge that there are things that make sense about the market.\n\nThe PFIs and the private sector being involved in health isn't necessarily a bad thing, but reform is important. And and just tonally, I thought he was he was respectful towards Rishi Sunak, which we don't hear often. And all of that, oddly, would be what would convince, I think, me and many people like me to vote for Labour.\n\nSpeaker 0: Although he he also did say he felt that West Breeding Was very much not part of the Mingvaz strategy as he described it. I also like the fact that, I mean, obviously, I know Alan's backstory. I know his about his childhood and his upbringing. I hadn't realized that he'd sort of felt he couldn't talk about that when he was a politician. Yeah.\n\nAnd I'm thinking that's because, actually, maybe he I don't know whether there was a slight sort of sense of, well, if you're coming from this poor background, You either look like you're trying to use it or you're giving you're giving the sense that, you know, you're not really you're not really made for this. So I think he came across very, very authentic. And for those who haven't heard Rory Stewart's hero, his word, not mine, Alan Millburn, Just search leading, that's the word single word, leading wherever you get your podcasts. Now should we turn abroad?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's turn abroad. So Israel Palestine, should we start with that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, there's old Antony Blinken, secretary of state, Going he saw Netanyahu yesterday, is off to see Mahmoud Abbas today. And I really feel for the guy because, I mean, how many times can you sort of go there and say, we're absolutely committed to the two state solution, and we call on both parties to blah dee, blah dee, blah dee, blah? And this is the reality of what's happened, I think, in you know, it's fair to say there are they can you can point defaults on both sides, But that government that you've now got in and and obviously what happened with the the killings at the weekend was horrific, but you now have and you knew this was going to happen because of just how right wing the Israeli government now is. There was only ever going to be a security response.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it is it worthwhile just to make I as you say, we've got very sophisticated listeners, but Shall I shall I just try to give a because I'm speaking to you from Jordan Yeah. Very close to the to the Palestinian border. Just to remind people a little bit about The way in which at least Palestinians and Jordanians perceive this. So I think just to remind people of the very, very basic things, which is State of Israel emerged in 1948. And for many Palestinians, even the territory that Israel captured in 1948 involved them being displaced from their homes, and they still regard that as an occupation.\n\nThat's not the way the international community Regards it. But the international community is focused on what happened in 1967, which was the 6 day war, where Israel basically, in 6 days, defeated Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, Took the Golan Heights, took the West Bank, which was previously controlled by Jordan. And it's from then onwards that we really have the deep sense of the international community saying, this territory is occupied Palestinian territory. It should not belong to Israel. And a debate within Israel, which used to be much fierce than it is today between Liberals saying we don't need this territory conservatives saying this territory is vital for Israeli national security.\n\nAnd that debate actually is my last visit To to Israel, I got a sense that, actually, the Israeli Liberals are less strong than they were, that a new generation has emerged, that people are less Interest in making the case for the two stage solution. And this brings us to the final thing, which is what's at the heart of what we're dealing with now, which is that we came out of these agreements. People would have heard of the Oso Accords, would have heard of Camp David, which was an attempt again to do it in 2000. And this divided The territory Palestinian territory into areas a, b, and c. Broadly speaking, area a was the areas which were absolutely Palestinian, b were ambiguous, and see where areas where there were Israeli settlements.\n\nAnd Israeli settlements are 400,000 Israelis who have built Villages, in some cases, towns or even cities, and over a 100 of them are completely informal things where they just push out, take a piece of territory In the middle of what the Palestinians do with their territory. So while the Palestinians have these scraps of territory, I think they've got A 166 separate little entities. And when I was traveling through Palestine, you're going through checkpoints all the time. You're driving down essentially tunnels with Breeze block on either side to try to get to somewhere like Nablus. And I I think understanding this or trying to understand it From these 2 points of view is essential, but I think quite difficult to articulate because even when I'm talking to you now, I'm aware that there will be many listeners on both sides Saying what an outrageous way of characterizing the conflict.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think that's pretty fair. And and and, also, it's it's gone on now for for decades with various Points at which you mentioned Oslo. You mentioned Camp David. I can remember when Tony Blair went to the Middle East not long after we'd done the Good Friday Agreement. And I'm not linking the 2.\n\nI'm simply saying that at that time, there felt like this could happen. It felt like something was really moving. But unless you have, particularly the Americans, but the international community more broadly, Really, really focused on this and really, really trying on to port every single lever that's available to you, then it just sort of it just It feels like it evaporates. And I watched Blinken with with Netanyahu yesterday, and I think Blinken's a pretty impressive Secretary of state, I think Biden, like previous American presidents, really does feel a sense of responsibility because The American power there really matters. But that and that relationship with the Israelis is incredibly strong, But it sort of I I kinda felt blinking.\n\nIt felt to me like he was slightly going through the motions.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100%. And and that's I think you put your finger on it, Alastair, and I think it's actually unspoken policy now, Washington, that this is not going to be their issue, That Biden has signalled that Israel Power sign is not what this administration's concentrating on, and so they will continue saying That they call on all sides to show restraint. They will continue to use all the old language, their unconditional support for Israel. They'll keep the three At $8,000,000,000 a year, which US provides in support for Israel, you'll notice Blinken didn't mention the settlements, in his in his speech, but I don't get the impression that this is something they're gonna be leaning into or trying to resolve. And in the absence of that, the truth is that many of the people around The new Israeli prime minister, Rabi, are gonna be pushing hard to extend those settlements further, to reinforce them, to connect with roads, To put the whole Social Security system behind them to get electricity into them.\n\nMhmm. And, of course, Ben Gavir, who's the national security adviser now or the the head of national department minister has just again made a very provocative visit to the Temple Mount, to the Haram and Sharif.\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought also it was the the The Palestinian who committed that atrocity at the at the weekend, when I saw the Israeli Defense forces then being filmed by themselves and releasing the film of them going in to effectively demolish the house where he came from and and kick out his family. His father there saying he had no idea this was happening. And I just think and and and the response has been one of, as I say, security, security, security, which I get from the kind of mindset. But at the same time, in terms it feels like you're pushing The idea of any kind of solution further and further away. And the other thing which I think Blinken did raise and I think was right to raise is the Americans' worries that they have about the the the the new government's determination to do something about the independence of the judiciary.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. And then then just to put the Point of view from from the other point of view, I mean, it's this is incredibly presumptuous of me because I'm not in the middle of this, but I also, have traveled around Israel with Israeli friends who feel so strongly the threat. Mhmm. They they they feel threatened. The way that they perceive this is that they are facing an existential challenge, that they need to control this territory in order to, guarantee the survival of of Israel as it exists.\n\nAnd also that the tragedy of the last few years Is that there's so little interaction now between Israelis and Palestinian communities. I I remember that when I visited 25 years ago, you could drive very comfortably from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, and many Israelis would would visit Bethlehem. And now there are big signs are put up by the Israeli government saying do not enter this territory. You could be a danger of your life. And so Bethlehem, which is a very, peaceful part of Palestine, I mean, there there are more tricky bits, sitting here on Nablus may be a bit trickier, But even the most peaceful bits are now perceived.\n\nBits just a few miles outside Jerusalem are perceived as being these very hostile alien territories, and you you get the sense that There's so little understanding now about different people's experiences and cultures.\n\nSpeaker 0: The trips I did with with Tony, the other thing you when when you Go from one to the other. You do really, really do have this strong sense of going from, to use the old language, you know, the 1st world to the 3rd world, literally the moment you crossed the border. I can remember 1 visit where I think yes Sharon was prime minister. And to this day, I don't know where we were driven, but I I the security around me was just extraordinary. We'd driven into this sort of, It felt like a garage in a Lyft.\n\nAnd we drive in and it it honestly, it was like I said that with James Bondenfeld. We drive in and the car stops, And then we sort of the car goes up in a lift, and then we come out at a different place. And then suddenly, we're in Sherrod's house. And then you cross the border, so you've got all that. And then you cross the border, and we and we had I remember having this meeting with with Yasser Arafat just over the border.\n\nYou felt you'd suddenly gone to a A very poor country from a very wealthy country. And that, I think, further exacerbates this sense of divisions that can't be bridged.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let let's let's move on to the thing that you, I think, were quite right to raise and almost nobody talks about, which is what's happening now in Nagorno Karabakh, Which is this disputed territory between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Tell us a little bit about why you wanted to talk about that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I've I've been I've been talking to to people, particularly on the the Armenian government side. And I think it is one of those situations where It just gets it gets no kind of real it doesn't really get any coverage at all in in in large parts of the of the media, but it's an incredibly Important story for lots and lots of different reasons. I mean, just what so wind back to when the Soviet Union collapsed in the early nineties. You had ethnic Armenian separatists in this area, Karabakh, who broke away from Azerbaijan. There was a war, estimated 30,000 lives lost.\n\nThen there was a peace process that's been going on since 1990 four. But then there was a new war started in 2020.\n\nSpeaker 1: So 2025 years later, which is interesting, is it?\n\nSpeaker 0: The answer is yes. It's 20 it flares up. I don't know about the Azerbaijan side, but I think there were 5,000 Armenians killed in that. Armenia was then forced to return Occupied territories around Nagorno Karabakh. So now Nagorno Karabakh is landlocked inside Armenia Yep.\n\nBut disputed. And it's governed by some something called the NKR, which is Nagorno Karabakh Republic. Russia has sent this billionaire to kind of be the sort of The overlord as it were. And you have if you look at if you look at it on a map, Nagorno Karabakh, which is It's relatively small. It's about 1700 square miles and and very kind of agricultural, very rural, very foresty.\n\nYep. Population, Roughly a 120,000, so quite small numbers of people. But because it's landlocked, to go from Armenia to Gorno Karabakh, you have to cross about 20 kilometers of Azerbaijan. Yep. And this protest has now started, and it's a protest that is clearly organized by the Azerbaijan government.\n\nYep. But it's a it's reportedly protesting a gold mining that's going on inside, inside the Gorno Karabakh. And what it means is that There's apart from some traffic from the Red Cross, you can't get in and out. And they say they are saying that within the Gorno Karabakh Now there's a humanitarian crisis. But meanwhile, you have all this geopolitical stuff going on around it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think that's a brilliant description of it. And and, actually, Azerbaijan itself is also split into different bits. There's a bit called Nakijaban, which is again separate.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is the other side of Armenia.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Traveling through Armenian territory to get to. Yeah. So to take listen back to the real basics. Armenia, oldest Christian state in the world, 1st 1st country to convert to Christianity.\n\nAzerbaijan, predominantly Muslim and related very closely, linguistically, culturally, to Turkey. And as you say, it's become a real center for geoconflict. So the War in the nineties saw the Armenians essentially win in Nagorno Karabakh and kick out 600,000 to a1000000 Azerbaijanis. And then 25 years later, Azerbaijan came back the other way. And when Azerbaijan came back the other way, which was, as you say, 2020, And they came back this time supported very strongly by Turkey that provided them with drones.\n\nTurkish f sixteens landed on Azerbaijani airfields, and they won this victory that essentially took back a lot of the territory and kicked out a lot of Armenians. And the Russians Got a lot of credit in 2020. This was pre the invasion of Crimea for soft power and diplomacy and sending in a couple of 1,000 troops And seeming to police a ceasefire and keep everything going. And\n\nSpeaker 0: they're still there.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they're still there. But as you've pointed out, they've completely failed to respond to this blockade, which is effectively strangling the Armenian population of Gorakharek.\n\nSpeaker 0: And\n\nSpeaker 1: the question is, why are they not responding? And it seems as though Russia's power is ebbing. And probably it's that Putin now needs to keep Turkey on side because he's got So few friends out there in the world that he's not prepared to have this fight anymore.\n\nSpeaker 0: The other the other relatively new factor is that the European Union has now got involved and has sent this mission, civilian mission, to monitor the border, which Moscow has now said is a a terrible provocation, one of their favorite words, And the Americans, Blinken talking of Blinken again, Blinken has expressed support for the European Union taking an interest. And if you look at You look at the map, you've got Turkey, you've got Iran, on one of the other borders. The Armenians say the Pakistanis are getting involved, and getting engaged. And you talked about the the this this where they got the support from Turkey in the previous war. They now have Support from Israel in terms of drones where there's a bit of a sort of deal going on for, you know, drones and oil supplies.\n\nWise. And, of course, the and the British just to throw in a a slight British element in the air, of course, one of the biggest players inside Azerbaijan is BP.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Because Azerbaijan, unlike Armenia, is the big oil and gas hub of the region, and that's one of the reasons they've been able to fund this over the 25 years, build up their armed forces to recapture. Maybe in another episode, the story of what's happening to all these states that were part of the former Soviet Union around the fringe of Russia And their in particularly in Central Asia and in the Caucasus, their failure, really, to make the transition to liberal democracies, the ways in which Russia has continued to bail out dictators in from Belarus all the way through to Kazakhstan. And these the strange nature of the rule of Aliyev in Azerbaijan or indeed his quote in Armenia. I think the this is this is good stuff because this is right at the center of what's happening in the in what we publicly call\n\nSpeaker 0: the global order. Yeah. Absolutely. And and and and it is it is interesting how in this one, For example, the the Ukraine seems to side much more with Azerbaijan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, wow. I wasn't expecting that.\n\nSpeaker 0: There was, an interview recently with one of Zelensky's key people who said that The essentially, he was saying that the whole thing is being whipped up, by the Armenians, possibly by the Russians as well, but to take attention away from Ukraine.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh goodness.\n\nSpeaker 0: And essentially saying that this one doesn't really matter that much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gosh. When you would have thought their natural in sync sale literature. Yeah. Okay. Well, lot more to be discussed.\n\nThank you for raising Nagorno Karabakh. Alastair, without you, we would not have. We definitely thought we got there. And I think maybe that brings us the end of this week's pod.\n\nSpeaker 0: I shall be off now to see your friend Jacob Rees Mogg, your fellow atonian, and I shall do exactly as you said. I have my tactics prepared.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good luck. Very well. I'm reaching for you. Bye bye.",
