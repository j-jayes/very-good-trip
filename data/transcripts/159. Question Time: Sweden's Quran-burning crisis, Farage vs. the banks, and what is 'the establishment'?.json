So welcome to The Rest is Politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And, Alastair, you are seeing me now sitting here in the remains of my house in Amman. I've got boxes all around me. I can see. This is the last time you'll be seeing me at this desk, And we're putting the whole family on a plane first thing tomorrow morning with a loss of stress from the children about whether I have somehow not packed the right toys. My attempts to secretly hide half their plastic crap is is is being exposed all the time. So this this is a major life move. You're leaving the Middle East? Leaving the Middle East, returning back to Blighty, where you and I could do more more more in person, I guess. I'm sure we can do more in person, but is this also possibly about trying to follow Nick Timothy, who's just been selected as a conservative party candidate in Matt Hancock's seat. No. I can categorically say that I am not running as a conservative candidate either to be mayor of London or as a member of parliament. I am currently not a member Of the Conservative Party. Are you planning to run-in any other shape or form for political office within the United Kingdom? Well, I think part of the problem is, is it really compatible with a podcast? I mean, if I'm suddenly sitting in parliament, who's gonna trust and believe that I'm remotely objective on our podcast? Well, I can be the judge of that, and and I can pull you into shape whenever I feel You're astray. So that wasn't a no. That was not a no. Well, I don't know. It just represents my anxiety about our podcast. Okay. Okay. So you're not going to be a politician again. Is that what you're telling me? Well, I don't think not not for this election. Maybe next time. And meanwhile, I suppose the other reason you're coming back to London is because Politics on the Edge will be published in September. Thank you very much for reminding people of that. And if anybody felt like preordering Politics on the Edge, I would be hugely Grateful. We were going to talk about Sweden and the Quran on the main podcast, but we we ran out of time because we talked a lot about Niger. But we did ask lots of questions. Here's one from somebody who sounds moderately Swedish, I think, Marietta Bierome. How do you 2 feel about the public burning of the crown in Sweden, which has caused an outrage in much of the Muslim world? Sweden holds on to the freedom of speech and opinion. In Finland, it would oh, maybe maybe she's a fin. In Finland, it would not be legal, although Finland is also a solid democracy. What should Sweden do? Been fascinating this because, of course, it's a classic conflict, isn't it, between absolute core belief in freedom of speech and the natural desire, particularly for what's seen as a very tolerant country in the main, not to be seen as a very intolerant country, Provoking massive protests. We talked in the main podcast about the French embassy coming under attack in Niger. Well, the Swedish embassy Has come under attack in Baghdad. It was an Iraqi Christian exile who applied to the police For permission to hold a protest, held the protest in which he set the Quran on fire, and this has started a wave of protests, including economic protests now with countries calling for a boycott of Swedish goods. And Sweden is a big, big, big exporter to that part of the world. So let's say you were back in the foreign office. You were a foreign minister, but you're not the foreign minister now of the United Kingdom, but it's Sweden and Denmark, which has also had the same problem. What would you do? Well, I think let me take 1 step back before I get to that one. I think it's a good question, but 1 step back. Speaking here from Jordan, whatever the rights or wrongs fit, it is massive news here. People in Jordan are very, very, very angry, And they're angry in Malaysia. They're angry in Turkey. They're angry in Egypt. I don't know how much has been covered in the UK, but it is huge front page news here. The Swedish ambassador, who's a friend of mine here in Amman, a very good Swedish ambassador, has been called in and almost threatened with being expelled from the country. I think the Sweden and Swedish ambassador in Baghdad has been expelled. Right. And then, you know, I've been talking to, senior people in the Middle East who were due to address major on Sweden who are boycotting Sweden because they they don't want to be seen to be endorsing this, so I think it's important to understand that whatever the argument around freedom of speech From the point of view of many Muslims, this is incomprehensibly offensive. The Quran is not treated exactly in the same way the Bible is. You know, if you handle a Quran in someone's house, it's often wrapped very carefully, placed in a special box. In many cultures, it's held High above your head when you take it. And because the bible is inspired by God, but the Quran is the direct word of God In the in the view of a a Muslim dictated to the prophet Mohammed. So it's very, very difficult for many, many Muslims To see this as anything other than a deliberate assault on Islam, and it's not made need here by the fact that, of course, the people often stirring this up In Denmark and Sweden are, of course, from the far right. It's not accidental that they're burning the Quran as opposed to burning the Torah or the bible. They're doing it to appeal to anti Muslim supporters. So back to the point about were you in in office? Because what the prime ministers of the 2 countries have had to wrestle with of Sweden and Denmark is is whether they essentially sacrificed that sense of total commitment to freedom of speech by saying, I I guess what they could say, because at the moment, it is the police who decide whether or not people can hold protests, whether they actually say, no. The government is going to decide this, and we've decided we're not going to allow protesters to burn the Quran. Yeah. I mean, I I may be influenced by the fact that I grew up and spent a lot of my life in Muslim countries, but I definitely am more sympathetic To the British approach. So you remember in in Gateshead, some Qurans were burnt and stamped on back in 2010, and the police took immediate tick on the grounds of hate crime, and I think that is perfectly legitimate. I cannot see this except in terms of a deliberate hate crime designed to try to Antagonize and alienate. And and I I don't wanna push this too far, but you can think of many other profoundly offensive things that could be done by far right groups, You know, dressing up in Ku Klux Klan uniforms and the like, which we would very easily see as hate crime. I think it's partly because the progressive left in some countries are uncomfortable with religion that they're unsure how to react. This particular incident in Sweden, though, wasn't somebody from the far right, though the far right been exploiting it since. It was an Iraqi Christian exile Yeah. Who may or may not be far right. I don't know. But it wasn't, as we would say, traditional Swedish far right. There is a far right in Sweden, and they did far better. The Sweden Democrats, they're one of the most misnamed parties I would suggest, but they did very, very well. 62 seats, 2nd largest party in parliament, and and basically emerged from a Biologically racist party that actually believes that anyone adopted in Sweden, this back in 19 eighties, anyone adopted in Sweden who wasn't white should be sent out of Sweden. So there's a huge background to this, which is very worrying. And you mentioned, just to make it more complicated for the the Swedish government, is that they you mentioned Turkey. And, of course, Erdogan was somewhat reluctantly dragged to a position of supporting Sweden's membership of NATO, which is one of the big events post the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but is now, of course, starting to stir in relation to this and suggesting that, well, perhaps Sweden Isn't a reliable country because they've allowed this situation to get out of hand, so it's a horribly complicated situation. My hunch is that both Sweden and Denmark will move to a position closer to our own where you can actually say, no. You are not allowed to burn the Koran. Now here's a very good question for you. Peter Dirk Dekker, as a regular listener to your podcast From the Netherlands, I was somewhat surprised to see the political decline of one of Europe's longest serving prime ministers, Mark Lutter, go wholly unnoticed in your otherwise very international podcast. What is your perception of the Dutch political crisis in the upcoming November elections? Well, it's true that we didn't do a sort of big special on the Netherlands. And we did, I think, mention Mark Rutter when he decided to step down. That was when a few weeks ago now. And in the main episode this week, we did talk briefly about the Netherlands, and I think I made the point that they were giving a very good sense of becoming somewhat ungovernable. I mean, look, you've all of the main players within the current coalition essentially have said that they're stepping down. And there was quite a moving statement by the deputy prime minister who said that she was leaving politics in part because it had become so horrible. And apparently, her daughters went on television to say that they were urging her to stop because of all the threats that were being made against her. Some guy in jail for turning up at a house waving a torch in her face. So I don't know. I I think as to what happens in the election, And we talked yesterday about this Farmers' Party that's doing very well. The far right is, Wilders is back, sort of, you know, making lots of noise. And It's very, very hard to read how this election, which is not going to be for another few months yet, is going to play out. We will definitely talk about it near the time when it becomes a little clearer as to what's gonna happen. One thing that's cheered me up a little bit, we often talk about how unpleasant politics has become, which is One of the reasons why I'm a little bit reluctant to dive back in in this election. But I had the privilege here in Jordan of hosting for lunch a group of parliamentary candidates for the UK elections from the Labour and the Conservative parties. It was extraordinary. It was brought together by a, coalition for global prosperity, which is, campaigns around international development, and they had brought this Group of mostly young people, diverse, bright, interesting, pretty difficult for me to be honest To tell going around the table who was conservative and who was Labour. And I was so impressed that notwithstanding how horrifying British politics has become here were a dozen really bright motivated interesting people from interesting backgrounds who seem to be on track to become members of parliament, interested in international development, interested in visiting a refugee camp in Jordan. So I I maybe they've been reading, but what can I do? Oh, that's very that's very heartening to hear. Look. I do think the next generation's Got to be better than this. I mean, I I agree with Chris Bryant's assessment in his book code of conduct that this has been the worst parliament in probably in our well, certainly in our lifetime, but possibly ever. Just very briefly on the the other thing that's maybe worth saying on on Holland, I talked about the deputy prime minister, Zygrit Kach, Musette is stepping down. And there was a piece in, I think it was The Times earlier this week, about the Dutch equivalent of Mi five who are warning that what they call anti institutional extremist movement targeting democratic authorities. And these are basically people who think that there's an evil elite running the country, that it controls the government, the big companies, the judges, science, newspapers, the TV channels. You know, I think we often think of the Netherlands as Sort of, you know, sane, sensible, and and so forth. But there's a real kind of underbelly there at the moment that the authorities are clearly very, very worried about. And the statement made by a secret car when she stepped down was pretty sad. Well, here we are for a question that's really gonna irritate you and one that you've been trying to avoid, and you tell us why you've been trying to avoid it. So David Crozier, the Farage fiasco. Just to remind listeners, Farage fiasco is David Crozier referring to the fact that Nigel Farage had his bank account closed by Coots Bank, which is a subsidiary of NatWest. He protested it. Number of statements were made by NatWest, and the chairman of NatWest has now resigned. So the franchise fiasco, is this a real story or a prime example of a populist playing the victim to advance his polarizing agenda. And I suspect we will disagree on this, Alastair, which is always good on this podcast. Over to you first. Well, I think it's both. It is a real story. However, something happens to our media, particularly when it's about figures who are very, very well known on the right. I've actually written my new European column about this. It's not that I don't want to talk about Nigel Farage. I just think this story is being talked about far too much. But the point I've made in in my column is that we don't have a serious government at the moment. We don't have a serious media, and the combination means that we just go from one spasm to the next. So we had the Gary Lineker spasm a few months ago when all that the media could cover was Gary Lineker's tweet about refugees. We then had the Hugh Edwards spasm, and that came and that that lasted for days and days and days, and then it just went. And now we've had the Farage Coote spasm. And the other thing that I I don't believe that Nigel Farage should be allowed in front of a microphone anywhere without being grilled rigorously, robustly on Brexit because he was such a major player in it. And what what I think the media is allowing him to do now He sort of reinvent himself as a consumer champion just because he couldn't get an account with Coots bloody bank, for god's sake. So I'm not saying they didn't make mistakes, But, honestly, it's not that big a deal. Well, let let me let me sort of slightly agree with you, but slightly disagree. I think what happened was Pretty outrageous. So Coutts took away his account. He questioned it. They then leaked to the BBC The the reason that his account had been suspended is he didn't have enough money. This turned out to be completely untrue. It turned out when they managed to get hold of a more than 40 page document that they actually accepted in the document that he did have enough money to have his account at Coutts. And the head of NatWest had briefed the BBC. She'd leaked stuff that broke clients' confidentiality, but more importantly, she'd lied So the the CEO of this big bank had told a direct lie to the BBC, and so I think it's absolutely right that she went. I thought it was a bit odd, in fact, that NatWest originally tried to keep her and drop her bonus, which was the worst of all worlds. I mean, the board must have gone mad. And I was I think the hero of this story Is our friend John Sopol, who produced a tweet saying, dear Nigel, always believed when I get things wrong, I own up to it. I got it wrong. Sorry. That will teach me to trust reporting of my old employer, smiley face, the BBC. If your political views were even part of the reason why the account The suspended from Coutts. That is totally reprehensible, John. So well done, John Soper. Yeah. Fair enough. Fair enough. But I still think there's a wonderful clip of Matt Fry, channel 4, chasing Nigel Farage down the street, trying to find out where Nigel Farage gets all his money from, which is a legitimate question. And I think if there was a little bit more focus on that, a little bit less focus on where he can bank his bloody money, We might know more. Nigel Farage, he's a very, very effective communicator. He's a very effective campaigner. But his role in our national life as one of the creators of a project which has gone horribly wrong, he now barely talks about it anymore. He moves on to his next populist cause, and I don't believe we should help him to do that. Very good. Right. Let's just stick with Farage for a moment, Rory. Stu Balmer, dear Rory and Alastair, could you please explain to me, Farage and that lot always go on about the establishment. Who are the establishment? I always thought they were they were the establishment coming from very expensive private education as they have the power. Stew, that is a very good question, and it relates to something we've talked about before. They are the establishment. People like Farage and the right wing newspapers that yet again are doing his bidding, They are the establishment. But what they do is they persuade people that they're there for the little people. And that is why I make the link to Brexit. That Brexit was a victory for people who represent a big part of what I define as the establishment and their political and economic forces on the right. And they only won by persuading people that actually they're with them against this mythical elite. I think we've gotta be careful here because I think that there's a risk of saying the elite is mythical, but the establishment is real. I think these are all Different ways of struggling with where power lies, and there are different types of power in Britain's economic power. There is cultural power. There's governmental power. And I think there's a perfectly good case to be made that Britain, like any diverse modern society, has a lot of competing establishments. There's definitely a type of an establishment that, you know, you and I are part of. There's part of an establishment that Farage is part of. But even Nigel Farage's best pals Cannot say that he doesn't represent a form of elite establishment power. He does. And that's the tragedy, of course, for all these populist movements that they all involve just new forms of elite trying to present themselves as anti elite. I agree. Alright. Let's take a quick break there, Rory. We'll be back in a minute. Welcome back to The rest is politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. I'm Ernie Oskamal. Okay. Senkai Sia. Senkai Sia is a a British student who's in California. What are your thoughts on the effectiveness of Tony Blair's central government machinery units, like the delivery and strategy units that were abolished by Cameron? Does Alastair think their work improved policy implementation? Was Laurie suspicious them centralizing power and micromanaging Whitehall? Are these units a good model to deploy to other countries as advocated by the Tony Blair Institute? There we are. Over to you. Well, I think they're also advocated by those countries which have adopted them. I think it was a mistake of David Cameron to get rid of them. Look, strategies kind of, you know, whether you have a strategy unit in the way it's set out in the question, I think it's probably less important than a delivery unit. The strategy has to come from the people at the top who define a strategy, execute the strategy, and narrate the strategy, take that forward. But I think delivery It's so difficult in public services. It's become more difficult, and you can only do it if you're constantly on top of keeping track of it. And look, the delivery unit model that we brought in headed by Michael Barber, who was terrific and Sir Michael Barber. Sir Michael Barber. Yes. But as you know, Rory, I'm not I don't I don't always feel I have to give people their title. But sir Michael Barber, A very fine man. And, look, it's it's true that I I visit lots of different governments in different parts of the world. It is it isn't to see how many of them have his book on their bookshelves because I think they realize that what the public want from their governments these days is delivery. How do you track delivery? Well, you do. It's not micromanaging, but you have to have somewhere within government where you're tracking it. And I think the center is the place to have that. And also that it means that you can track thematically across government. You know? If you have a strategy for public service modernization, that's not just about 1 public service. It's about a general approach. So I'm a big fan of delivery units. Yeah. Well, I I'm quite a fan too, and I'm actually quite a fan of Michael Barber. I got him in to talk to my Yale class, and in fact, he very kindly came to see me when I was Running to be prime minister. He's written great book. People haven't looked at it called how to run a government so that citizens benefit and tax payers don't go crazy. He's tried like you. He's along with your per civilians, he's invented his own word, which is deliverology, which So I'm not quite sure how far deliverology is gonna go. I think perseverance wins. What do you think, Rory? Well, I don't like deliverology. I've always been a bit suspicious of sort of overly technocratic approaches to politics because I think it was one of the problems in the nineties that we didn't think enough about Emotion, identity, values, it's not all about sort of technocratic approach delivery, but a lot of it is. And I think Michael Bubba is very good at it. I think it's also unfortunately, although I'm tempted as a conservative to mount a very nostalgic Defense the civil service and say we don't need any of these special advisers. We don't need delivery units. It can all be done by the civil service. I think The truth of the matter is the world has got more and more complicated. The civil service faces so many legal challenges. It's very, very helpful. And I felt in 2010, and Lot of politics on the edge is actually about what happened when those units were got rid of. I really felt that Cameron struggled in those 1st 5 years because he didn't have those kind of units to help Drive through policy. Philippa Vance. Rory mentioned party discipline a few weeks ago. Please can you explain what's the point of having MPs if the expectation is they vote with their party. I appreciate the 2 can rebel, but that's at a cost and lead to MPs choosing their votes against wisely. So let let me try to answer that. The answer is that in systems where there is no party discipline and Every legislator can vote as they want, which was the system in Britain in the 18th century. Paradoxically, you often end up with even more corruption Because each one of those individual votes is open for manipulation and buying. And that's why traditionally in the US, before there were strong party systems, When senators and congresspeople all voted very independently, you had this pork barrel politics. MPs become very, very vulnerable to saying, oh, I'm gonna hold back my vote unless you build a bridge to nowhere in my Constituency or you put an army base in my constituency. Because often when there isn't party discipline, yes, of course, in certain cases is the MPs are using their vote for the public good, but they can often be simply trading their vote for various types of reward. And the 2nd problem with a system without any parties is that when you are a voter in your constituency, You're usually not voting for the individual MP. In some cases, you may not even know who your MP is. You're voting for a party. You're voting for the manifesto of that party. Say you're voting in 1997, you're voting to bring in new Labour, and you've read their manifesto or you've got some sense of it, You're expecting them to do the kinds of things that Tony Blair says they're gonna do. And if you wake up the next morning and find your Labour MP is deliberately voting against Tony Blair's policies repeatedly, so he can't get his policies through, you feel a bit disenfranchised. So there are strong arguments for why parties matter And why party discipline matters because it brings a bit of order and structure to what would otherwise be 50,000,000 individual voters and 650 individual MPs. Yeah. And, you know, we've talked recently both about Holland, the Netherlands, and Spain where It would seem that it's impossible to form a government. And when we talk about forming a government, when we have a general election and people say which party leader is able to quote former government, close quotes. That means, do they have enough people in the new House of Commons that can be expected to vote, particularly for a budget, but for other things that that party has been promising in a campaign. So I I I broadly agree with that. I think sometimes perhaps MP should be allowed a little bit more freedom in terms of what they say and do, but I think the broad approach that you're electing a party as well as an individual MP, I think still serves us reasonably well. And and I think the way to resolve it is that you let the MPs rebel. I mean, I did rebel, but you put the cost on it quite high So that they rebel on 1 or 2 issues that really matter to them existentially. But the the public understands that looking at their voting record cord. Doesn't tell you very much because 95% of their votes, you can expect to be in line with their party. And when they really find something in the way that I did About a no deal Brexit. Yep. At that point, they resigned from the government. They leave the cabinet. They rebel against their party. They get thrown out of their party, And they have to have the option to do that. Otherwise, you won't be able to stop extreme injustice, but there has to be that balance between freedom and discipline. Now United Nations Security Council, Asa Stanley, a few weeks ago, Rory said that if the United Nations Security Council was picked today, the UK would not be on it. Who would the major five be today if the council was going to be changed now? Okay. So I think that the normal argument is you'd give much bigger space to the BRICS Because they represent the big regional powers, Brazil and Latin America, India in Asia, obviously, China and Russia are already on the council, South Africa or Nigeria In Africa, because one of the fundamental problems at the moment is sub Saharan Africa is not represented at all. Latin America is not represented at all. South Asia is not represented at all, and that makes less and less sense given the populations and the economic size of these countries. Yeah. I think the countries that would Think that they deserve a place would be India, Germany, Japan. Have I missed any? Brazil, Possibly. If it was being set up in terms of power today, I think, actually, if you were going to revisit it, perhaps you'd you'd sort of say, well, the only 2 I mean, you'd probably start a world war, which I don't think would be a very good idea. You probably would kick off Russia and the UK and France. And bring in the EU? You bring in the EU on there. You probably have United States, European Union, China, and then a body that brought together some something that represented Africa and then Latin America. I think that's how you'd work it. You can have an African Union seat and a Latin American seat. Yeah. Now listen. Here's my final one, Rory. Gone in. A bit lighter than what we we've been talking about. Charlie O'Neil, can Rory please share his favorite experience of Theresa May, I've got Alastair share his favorite experience of Gordon Brown. They are both good, hardworking PMs who were dealt a bad hand. So what's your favorite experience of Theresa May? My favorite experience, Theresa May, is when she was up in my constituency and seeing her come up as a very, very busy woman working the tables. She's she's not a big extrovert. She's quite quite an introverted person, but just showing the dedication late at night So getting around, meeting party members, listening to people, taking their experiences seriously. I felt in every engagement with her, Whether it was going to see her in the cabinet room when she was appointing me to a ministerial position or sitting in the cabinet with her around the table or the National Security Council, That this was somebody who was a serious human being doing her best. I I I was very, very proud to This is Servan Her government. Over to you on Gordon Brown. I'll tell you what, Rory. Because I'm very keen for both Theresa May and Gordon Brown to come on as guests of Leading, I'm going to link my favorite experience of Gordon Brown to a direct invitation to give me my tie back. Because on Gordon's last day as prime minister, and I'd been in there helping on the campaign and then was around for those rather strange days when the coalition was being put together. So when Gordon finally decided that, you know, he was calling it a day and he was gonna go and see the queen and and resign as prime minister, Gordon came down with Sarah, his wife, and these 2 boys, and he sort of said goodbye to people. And then Before he went out, he suddenly realized there was somebody pointing out to him that he's wearing a blue tie. And he thought, come back. Can't go out wearing a blue tie. And he looked around to see if anybody was wearing a red tie. I was wearing closest thing to a red tie. It wasn't quite Trumpian red but it was pretty red. So we should maybe share a picture in the newsletter of Gordon walking out as he resigned from number 10 in Mai Tai. Now that was 13 years ago. Now, Gordon, I want my tie back. So I suggest that when you Sit down with me and Rory for an episode of Leading that we have the handover of the red tie. Very good. Final question, Johnny p. What books are you currently reading? What have you just finished reading? We haven't had any cultural recommendations for a while. So while I give you a second to think about the answer, Johnny, the answer is because it's been a long time. I've been reading a lot of books. So here's a quick quick selection of books. Great book on trauma called The Body Keeps the Score by a person called Bessel van der Kolk, a novel called The General by c s Forrester who wrote the Hornblower series, which is about a 1st World War general. It's ironic, strange, moving, I think a really sort of weird, troubling insight Into the mentality of 1st World War generals recommended by my friend Mark Behan. If people have young children and want a gentle way of Introducing at least those more interested in samurai into Japan. There's a great book I'm reading my children at the moment called Young Samurai by somebody called Bradford. People want politics things. I've been looking at this child will be great, which is Mesmerizing by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, an account of her Going through a coup d'etat, she becomes present in Liberia. But in 1980, she goes through a coup d'etat where all but 3 of her cabinet colleagues are lined up on posts on the beach and shot. And finally, a little shout out to Ben Reilly Smith, who's a telegraph correspondent, just written a book called right to rule, which I think you might find quite interesting, which is an attempt to answer The fundamental question, how on earth did the conservatives remain in power given the catastrophic catalog of errors over 13 years just just coming out? So over to you. Any thoughts from you? Sorry. In that one, you say catastrophic errors over 13. Is it a book saying never vote for them again? Because I definitely would read that. Well, it's he's a telegraph journalist, but it's a book saying it's a bit weird given everything that happened, austerity, Brexit, Liz Truss, That the conservatives remained in power. So it's a question of what is the resilience of the conservative party? What is it that against all the odds meant that they kept winning elections through that period. Oh, I see. I've got it. I've got it. Okay. Now I have just finished a book which I think you would enjoy. Ticoy. It was published 96 years ago. Oh, yes. Very good. It was given to me as a gift by my editor of my book, which as you know is called Yeah. Pub. It's called, but what can I do? I almost said politics on the edge. I said sorry. Well, so my editor, Nigel, when, But what can I do? Reach number 1? My editor Nigel decided this was worthy of some sort of celebration, so he dug into his collection of Very rare first editions because there used to be such a thing, Roy. There isn't anymore, but there there is such a thing as a rare first edition. And he found this book called the piper In Peace and War. And it's just fantastic. It's, as you know, I I love the bagpipes, but the bagpipes have been an instrument of war. Right. Do you know when the bagpipes ceased to be officially recognized as an instrument of war? No. When? 1996. Not till 1996. The Labour government should have reversed But it's full of stories of amazing heroism of pipers in war. So I thoroughly enjoy that, and I think you would. I'm reading a book called Das Leben ist gut. Oh. Life is Good Gosh. By a guy called Alex Capus, c a p u s. And is that is that an ironic title or is it a self help book? Well, I'm only halfway through. It's a book about a couple who have never spent a night apart, and the wife goes off to Paris for a week. Ah. And it's still the guy. Well well, we don't know whether he is his date. Goodness gracious me. I think we know what's gonna happen there. I don't think I don't think that's the road it's going to go down, but it's one of those things where the guy who runs a bar, he's he's also a writer, but he runs a bar. And where I am at the moment is just sort of reflecting all these different personalities who come into his bar, but I'm thoroughly enjoying it. And then the other book I read recently, also Alf Deutsch, It's called Der Anhalta. But if I told you that the author was Lee Child you'll probably realize that it's That is a translation of a book that Lee Child wrote called The Hitchhiker. I've taken to reading Agatha Christian French because that's about the level of language I can do. And Shoshana, my wife, is reading Harry Potter in Arabic. Oh, wow. The other thing to tell you is that if you want a good French Novelists that I think if your French is not sort of mega good, but I think you would really like is Amelie Notame. She's a wonderful writer and but she writes in very, very clear simple French. People looking for things to listen to, I really recommend fantastic recordings by Gareth Armstrong, who's an English actor, of Maigret, Georges Simonon's Maigret novels, and I've been through 7 of these so far. And Gareth Armstrong beautifully uses English accents tickets. To capture different French personality types without you really noticing that seamless transition, and it's fantastically translated. And, Simon, I mean, it's I'm still staggered by the man. He wrote something like 500 books. He was generating 9 or 10 of these a year, and every one of them would have taken me 2 years to write at that kind of quality. Have I mentioned before Wendy Joseph, the Old Bailey judge? No. You've not. Was you talking about listening? Because we actually listened to this recently on a long drive up to the Lake District. Wendy Joseph, Old Bailey Judge, and her book is called Unlawful Killings. And it's written like a series of short stories, really, because it's she takes cases that she's been involved in. She disguises names and so forth. But It's beautifully written, but it also gives you a sense of the complexities of what goes in to a murder trial and the and the the number of lives that are affected by that. And she comes over as an incredibly sort of Empathetic, sensitive woman. But you really get a feeling for, you know how when we're following court cases and you sort of, You know, you think, oh, well, he's obviously guilty or he's not guilty, whatever. It really takes you into the complexities of the of the stories and the situations and and, ultimately, the judgments that she has to make. I I think we're gonna get in huge trouble from our very intimidating producer, Dom, who if people could see him, I think they would be scared, but, Luckily, it's an audio presentation. He's gonna be telling us off for giving more book recommendations, as you'd say, than the British Library. That's not how he's that's not how he speaks. He doesn't talk at all like that. Shut up, boys. Leave it till next week. He's also a Manchester City supporter. And as you know, Rory, Manchester City are set to lose their 1st game of the season because they're playing against Oh, wait. Wait. Wait. They're playing against Richmond FC, Ted Lasso's club? No. They're playing badly. Have you watched Ted Lasso? I have. I love it. I love it. I love it. Absolutely love it. Do you like it? Yeah. Yes. I do. I I love the positivity and and because usually watching stuff about football, Actors just can't do football because they're not good at all. Well, actually, they do it they do it pretty well. Are they playing football okay? How do they how do they actually play the football? Are the are the actors Just being forced to actually pass the ball, or they got stunt doubles? Yeah. They do. I think they do a bit of that, and they they have a bit of stunt double, and they have a bit of CGI and all that stuff. AI, Rory, it's you know, AI is gonna take over more. We've been watching something called The Offer, which is about the making of The Godfather. And as a result of which, having watched it, we rewatched The Godfather because it's 50 years now since The Godfather, And it was kind of okay. It was it was a bit bit dated. Really? Did Marlon Brando remind you a bit of Dom, our producer, that terrifying figure who keeps intervening? No. When Don says, Rory, I'm gonna make you an offer. I wasn't I I found Al Pacino more convincing than Marlon Brando. And, also, I know it was all part of the app, but I couldn't quite often I mean, I'm 66 now, and maybe it's just my hearing, but I I couldn't really work out what he was saying a lot of the time. And I think it's awful when you're watching films in your own language and you wanted want subtitles. Want the subtitles. My my sister once said, that she felt with one of her boyfriends that she'd she'd got together with the young Marlon Brando and ended up with the old Marlon Brando. Anyway, the offer the offer's quite good. Although, it was based on a book by somebody called Albert Ruddy, who was also the executive producer of the series. And the one thing I'll say about the series is that Albert Ruddy, who produced The Godfather, comes out as an utterly heroic figure. Extraordinary. Amazing. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Absolutely. Sounds good. A bit like me in politics on the edge. Right. Okay. Here we get to Wrap. Thank you very much, Alice, for this, and it's a goodbye to everyone from Jordan and my slightly never again for some time when you hear the call to prayer Or the gas van driving past playing its own ice cream tune. Alright, guys. Lovely to talk to you. Alright. Bye bye.",

To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show Just go to the rest is politics .com. That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: So welcome to The Rest is Politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, Alastair, you are seeing me now sitting here in the remains of my house in Amman. I've got boxes all around me.\n\nSpeaker 0: I can see.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the last time you'll be seeing me at this desk, And we're putting the whole family on a plane first thing tomorrow morning with a loss of stress from the children about whether I have somehow not packed the right toys. My attempts to secretly hide half their plastic crap is is is being exposed all the time.\n\nSpeaker 0: So this this is a major life move. You're leaving the Middle East?\n\nSpeaker 1: Leaving the Middle East, returning back to Blighty, where you and I could do more more more in person, I guess.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm sure we can do more in person, but is this also possibly about trying to follow Nick Timothy, who's just been selected as a conservative party candidate in Matt Hancock's seat.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I can categorically say that I am not running as a conservative candidate either to be mayor of London or as a member of parliament. I am currently not a member Of the Conservative Party.\n\nSpeaker 0: Are you planning to run-in any other shape or form for political office within the United Kingdom?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think part of the problem is, is it really compatible with a podcast? I mean, if I'm suddenly sitting in parliament, who's gonna trust and believe that I'm remotely objective on our podcast?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I can be the judge of that, and and I can pull you into shape whenever I feel You're astray. So that wasn't a no. That was not a no. Well, I\n\nSpeaker 1: don't know. It just represents my anxiety about our podcast.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. So you're not going to be a politician again. Is that what you're telling me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't think not not for this election.\n\nSpeaker 0: Maybe next time. And meanwhile, I suppose the other reason you're coming back to London is because Politics on the Edge will be published in September.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much for reminding people of that. And if anybody felt like preordering Politics on the Edge, I would be hugely Grateful.\n\nSpeaker 0: We were going to talk about Sweden and the Quran on the main podcast, but we we ran out of time because we talked a lot about Niger. But we did ask lots of questions. Here's one from somebody who sounds moderately Swedish, I think, Marietta Bierome. How do you 2 feel about the public burning of the crown in Sweden, which has caused an outrage in much of the Muslim world? Sweden holds on to the freedom of speech and opinion.\n\nIn Finland, it would oh, maybe maybe she's a fin. In Finland, it would not be legal, although Finland is also a solid democracy. What should Sweden do? Been fascinating this because, of course, it's a classic conflict, isn't it, between absolute core belief in freedom of speech and the natural desire, particularly for what's seen as a very tolerant country in the main, not to be seen as a very intolerant country, Provoking massive protests. We talked in the main podcast about the French embassy coming under attack in Niger.\n\nWell, the Swedish embassy Has come under attack in Baghdad. It was an Iraqi Christian exile who applied to the police For permission to hold a protest, held the protest in which he set the Quran on fire, and this has started a wave of protests, including economic protests now with countries calling for a boycott of Swedish goods. And Sweden is a big, big, big exporter to that part of the world. So let's say you were back in the foreign office. You were a foreign minister, but you're not the foreign minister now of the United Kingdom, but it's Sweden and Denmark, which has also had the same problem.\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think let me take 1 step back before I get to that one. I think it's a good question, but 1 step back. Speaking here from Jordan, whatever the rights or wrongs fit, it is massive news here. People in Jordan are very, very, very angry, And they're angry in Malaysia. They're angry in Turkey.\n\nThey're angry in Egypt. I don't know how much has been covered in the UK, but it is huge front page news here. The Swedish ambassador, who's a friend of mine here in Amman, a very good Swedish ambassador, has been called in and almost threatened with being expelled from the country.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the Sweden and Swedish ambassador in Baghdad has been expelled.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. And then, you know, I've been talking to, senior people in the Middle East who were due to address major on Sweden who are boycotting Sweden because they they don't want to be seen to be endorsing this, so I think it's important to understand that whatever the argument around freedom of speech From the point of view of many Muslims, this is incomprehensibly offensive. The Quran is not treated exactly in the same way the Bible is. You know, if you handle a Quran in someone's house, it's often wrapped very carefully, placed in a special box. In many cultures, it's held High above your head when you take it.\n\nAnd because the bible is inspired by God, but the Quran is the direct word of God In the in the view of a a Muslim dictated to the prophet Mohammed. So it's very, very difficult for many, many Muslims To see this as anything other than a deliberate assault on Islam, and it's not made need here by the fact that, of course, the people often stirring this up In Denmark and Sweden are, of course, from the far right. It's not accidental that they're burning the Quran as opposed to burning the Torah or the bible. They're doing it to appeal to anti Muslim supporters.\n\nSpeaker 0: So back to the point about were you in in office? Because what the prime ministers of the 2 countries have had to wrestle with of Sweden and Denmark is is whether they essentially sacrificed that sense of total commitment to freedom of speech by saying, I I guess what they could say, because at the moment, it is the police who decide whether or not people can hold protests, whether they actually say, no. The government is going to decide this, and we've decided we're not going to allow protesters to burn the Quran.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, I I may be influenced by the fact that I grew up and spent a lot of my life in Muslim countries, but I definitely am more sympathetic To the British approach. So you remember in in Gateshead, some Qurans were burnt and stamped on back in 2010, and the police took immediate tick on the grounds of hate crime, and I think that is perfectly legitimate. I cannot see this except in terms of a deliberate hate crime designed to try to Antagonize and alienate. And and I I don't wanna push this too far, but you can think of many other profoundly offensive things that could be done by far right groups, You know, dressing up in Ku Klux Klan uniforms and the like, which we would very easily see as hate crime.\n\nI think it's partly because the progressive left in some countries are uncomfortable with religion that they're unsure how to react.\n\nSpeaker 0: This particular incident in Sweden, though, wasn't somebody from the far right, though the far right been exploiting it since. It was an Iraqi Christian exile Yeah. Who may or may not be far right. I don't know. But it wasn't, as we would say, traditional Swedish far right.\n\nThere is a far right in Sweden, and they did far better. The Sweden Democrats, they're one of the most misnamed parties I would suggest, but they did very, very well.\n\nSpeaker 1: 62 seats, 2nd largest party in parliament, and and basically emerged from a Biologically racist party that actually believes that anyone adopted in Sweden, this back in 19 eighties, anyone adopted in Sweden who wasn't white should be sent out of Sweden. So there's a huge background to this, which is very worrying.\n\nSpeaker 0: And you mentioned, just to make it more complicated for the the Swedish government, is that they you mentioned Turkey. And, of course, Erdogan was somewhat reluctantly dragged to a position of supporting Sweden's membership of NATO, which is one of the big events post the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but is now, of course, starting to stir in relation to this and suggesting that, well, perhaps Sweden Isn't a reliable country because they've allowed this situation to get out of hand, so it's a horribly complicated situation. My hunch is that both Sweden and Denmark will move to a position closer to our own where you can actually say, no. You are not allowed to burn the Koran.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now here's a very good question for you. Peter Dirk Dekker, as a regular listener to your podcast From the Netherlands, I was somewhat surprised to see the political decline of one of Europe's longest serving prime ministers, Mark Lutter, go wholly unnoticed in your otherwise very international podcast. What is your perception of the Dutch political crisis in the upcoming November elections?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it's true that we didn't do a sort of big special on the Netherlands. And we did, I think, mention Mark Rutter when he decided to step down. That was when a few weeks ago now. And in the main episode this week, we did talk briefly about the Netherlands, and I think I made the point that they were giving a very good sense of becoming somewhat ungovernable. I mean, look, you've all of the main players within the current coalition essentially have said that they're stepping down.\n\nAnd there was quite a moving statement by the deputy prime minister who said that she was leaving politics in part because it had become so horrible. And apparently, her daughters went on television to say that they were urging her to stop because of all the threats that were being made against her. Some guy in jail for turning up at a house waving a torch in her face. So I don't know. I I think as to what happens in the election, And we talked yesterday about this Farmers' Party that's doing very well.\n\nThe far right is, Wilders is back, sort of, you know, making lots of noise. And It's very, very hard to read how this election, which is not going to be for another few months yet, is going to play out. We will definitely talk about it near the time when it becomes a little clearer as to what's gonna happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: One thing that's cheered me up a little bit, we often talk about how unpleasant politics has become, which is One of the reasons why I'm a little bit reluctant to dive back in in this election. But I had the privilege here in Jordan of hosting for lunch a group of parliamentary candidates for the UK elections from the Labour and the Conservative parties. It was extraordinary. It was brought together by a, coalition for global prosperity, which is, campaigns around international development, and they had brought this Group of mostly young people, diverse, bright, interesting, pretty difficult for me to be honest To tell going around the table who was conservative and who was Labour. And I was so impressed that notwithstanding how horrifying British politics has become here were a dozen really bright motivated interesting people from interesting backgrounds who seem to be on track to become members of parliament, interested in international development, interested in visiting a refugee camp in Jordan.\n\nSo I I maybe they've been reading, but what can I do?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, that's very that's very heartening to hear. Look. I do think the next generation's Got to be better than this. I mean, I I agree with Chris Bryant's assessment in his book code of conduct that this has been the worst parliament in probably in our well, certainly in our lifetime, but possibly ever. Just very briefly on the the other thing that's maybe worth saying on on Holland, I talked about the deputy prime minister, Zygrit Kach, Musette is stepping down.\n\nAnd there was a piece in, I think it was The Times earlier this week, about the Dutch equivalent of Mi five who are warning that what they call anti institutional extremist movement targeting democratic authorities. And these are basically people who think that there's an evil elite running the country, that it controls the government, the big companies, the judges, science, newspapers, the TV channels. You know, I think we often think of the Netherlands as Sort of, you know, sane, sensible, and and so forth. But there's a real kind of underbelly there at the moment that the authorities are clearly very, very worried about. And the statement made by a secret car when she stepped down was pretty sad.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, here we are for a question that's really gonna irritate you and one that you've been trying to avoid, and you tell us why you've been trying to avoid it. So David Crozier, the Farage fiasco. Just to remind listeners, Farage fiasco is David Crozier referring to the fact that Nigel Farage had his bank account closed by Coots Bank, which is a subsidiary of NatWest. He protested it. Number of statements were made by NatWest, and the chairman of NatWest has now resigned.\n\nSo the franchise fiasco, is this a real story or a prime example of a populist playing the victim to advance his polarizing agenda. And I suspect we will disagree on this, Alastair, which is always good on this podcast. Over to you first.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think it's both. It is a real story. However, something happens to our media, particularly when it's about figures who are very, very well known on the right. I've actually written my new European column about this. It's not that I don't want to talk about Nigel Farage.\n\nI just think this story is being talked about far too much. But the point I've made in in my column is that we don't have a serious government at the moment. We don't have a serious media, and the combination means that we just go from one spasm to the next. So we had the Gary Lineker spasm a few months ago when all that the media could cover was Gary Lineker's tweet about refugees. We then had the Hugh Edwards spasm, and that came and that that lasted for days and days and days, and then it just went.\n\nAnd now we've had the Farage Coote spasm. And the other thing that I I don't believe that Nigel Farage should be allowed in front of a microphone anywhere without being grilled rigorously, robustly on Brexit because he was such a major player in it. And what what I think the media is allowing him to do now He sort of reinvent himself as a consumer champion just because he couldn't get an account with Coots bloody bank, for god's sake.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm\n\nSpeaker 0: not saying they didn't make mistakes, But, honestly, it's not that big a deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let let me let me sort of slightly agree with you, but slightly disagree. I think what happened was Pretty outrageous. So Coutts took away his account. He questioned it. They then leaked to the BBC The the reason that his account had been suspended is he didn't have enough money.\n\nThis turned out to be completely untrue. It turned out when they managed to get hold of a more than 40 page document that they actually accepted in the document that he did have enough money to have his account at Coutts. And the head of NatWest had briefed the BBC. She'd leaked stuff that broke clients' confidentiality, but more importantly, she'd lied So the the CEO of this big bank had told a direct lie to the BBC, and so I think it's absolutely right that she went. I thought it was a bit odd, in fact, that NatWest originally tried to keep her and drop her bonus, which was the worst of all worlds.\n\nI mean, the board must have gone mad. And I was I think the hero of this story Is our friend John Sopol, who produced a tweet saying, dear Nigel, always believed when I get things wrong, I own up to it. I got it wrong. Sorry. That will teach me to trust reporting of my old employer, smiley face, the BBC.\n\nIf your political views were even part of the reason why the account The suspended from Coutts. That is totally reprehensible, John. So well done, John Soper.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Fair enough. Fair enough. But I still think there's a wonderful clip of Matt Fry, channel 4, chasing Nigel Farage down the street, trying to find out where Nigel Farage gets all his money from, which is a legitimate question. And I think if there was a little bit more focus on that, a little bit less focus on where he can bank his bloody money, We might know more.\n\nNigel Farage, he's a very, very effective communicator. He's a very effective campaigner. But his role in our national life as one of the creators of a project which has gone horribly wrong, he now barely talks about it anymore. He moves on to his next populist cause, and I don't believe we should help him to do that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Let's just stick with Farage for a moment, Rory. Stu Balmer, dear Rory and Alastair, could you please explain to me, Farage and that lot always go on about the establishment. Who are the establishment? I always thought they were they were the establishment coming from very expensive private education as they have the power.\n\nStew, that is a very good question, and it relates to something we've talked about before. They are the establishment. People like Farage and the right wing newspapers that yet again are doing his bidding, They are the establishment. But what they do is they persuade people that they're there for the little people. And that is why I make the link to Brexit.\n\nThat Brexit was a victory for people who represent a big part of what I define as the establishment and their political and economic forces on the right. And they only won by persuading people that actually they're with them against this mythical elite.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think we've gotta be careful here because I think that there's a risk of saying the elite is mythical, but the establishment is real. I think these are all Different ways of struggling with where power lies, and there are different types of power in Britain's economic power. There is cultural power. There's governmental power. And I think there's a perfectly good case to be made that Britain, like any diverse modern society, has a lot of competing establishments.\n\nThere's definitely a type of an establishment that, you know, you and I are part of. There's part of an establishment that Farage is part of.\n\nSpeaker 0: But even Nigel Farage's best pals Cannot say that he doesn't represent a form of elite establishment power. He does.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's the tragedy, of course, for all these populist movements that they all involve just new forms of elite trying to present themselves as anti elite. I agree.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Let's take a quick break there, Rory. We'll be back in a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome back to The rest is politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm Ernie Oskamal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Senkai Sia. Senkai Sia is a a British student who's in California. What are your thoughts on the effectiveness of Tony Blair's central government machinery units, like the delivery and strategy units that were abolished by Cameron? Does Alastair think their work improved policy implementation?\n\nWas Laurie suspicious them centralizing power and micromanaging Whitehall? Are these units a good model to deploy to other countries as advocated by the Tony Blair Institute? There we are. Over to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think they're also advocated by those countries which have adopted them. I think it was a mistake of David Cameron to get rid of them. Look, strategies kind of, you know, whether you have a strategy unit in the way it's set out in the question, I think it's probably less important than a delivery unit. The strategy has to come from the people at the top who define a strategy, execute the strategy, and narrate the strategy, take that forward. But I think delivery It's so difficult in public services.\n\nIt's become more difficult, and you can only do it if you're constantly on top of keeping track of it. And look, the delivery unit model that we brought in headed by Michael Barber, who was terrific and\n\nSpeaker 1: Sir Michael Barber.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sir Michael Barber. Yes. But as you know, Rory, I'm not I don't I don't always feel I have to give people their title. But sir Michael Barber, A very fine man. And, look, it's it's true that I I visit lots of different governments in different parts of the world.\n\nIt is it isn't to see how many of them have his book on their bookshelves because I think they realize that what the public want from their governments these days is delivery. How do you track delivery? Well, you do. It's not micromanaging, but you have to have somewhere within government where you're tracking it. And I think the center is the place to have that.\n\nAnd also that it means that you can track thematically across government. You know? If you have a strategy for public service modernization, that's not just about 1 public service. It's about a general approach. So I'm a big fan of delivery units.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, I I'm quite a fan too, and I'm actually quite a fan of Michael Barber. I got him in to talk to my Yale class, and in fact, he very kindly came to see me when I was Running to be prime minister. He's written great book. People haven't looked at it called how to run a government so that citizens benefit and tax payers don't go crazy.\n\nHe's tried like you. He's along with your per civilians, he's invented his own word, which is deliverology, which So I'm not quite sure how far deliverology is gonna go.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think perseverance wins. What do you think, Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't like deliverology. I've always been a bit suspicious of sort of overly technocratic approaches to politics because I think it was one of the problems in the nineties that we didn't think enough about Emotion, identity, values, it's not all about sort of technocratic approach delivery, but a lot of it is. And I think Michael Bubba is very good at it. I think it's also unfortunately, although I'm tempted as a conservative to mount a very nostalgic Defense the civil service and say we don't need any of these special advisers. We don't need delivery units.\n\nIt can all be done by the civil service. I think The truth of the matter is the world has got more and more complicated. The civil service faces so many legal challenges. It's very, very helpful. And I felt in 2010, and Lot of politics on the edge is actually about what happened when those units were got rid of.\n\nI really felt that Cameron struggled in those 1st 5 years because he didn't have those kind of units to help Drive through policy. Philippa Vance. Rory mentioned party discipline a few weeks ago. Please can you explain what's the point of having MPs if the expectation is they vote with their party. I appreciate the 2 can rebel, but that's at a cost and lead to MPs choosing their votes against wisely.\n\nSo let let me try to answer that. The answer is that in systems where there is no party discipline and Every legislator can vote as they want, which was the system in Britain in the 18th century. Paradoxically, you often end up with even more corruption Because each one of those individual votes is open for manipulation and buying. And that's why traditionally in the US, before there were strong party systems, When senators and congresspeople all voted very independently, you had this pork barrel politics. MPs become very, very vulnerable to saying, oh, I'm gonna hold back my vote unless you build a bridge to nowhere in my Constituency or you put an army base in my constituency.\n\nBecause often when there isn't party discipline, yes, of course, in certain cases is the MPs are using their vote for the public good, but they can often be simply trading their vote for various types of reward. And the 2nd problem with a system without any parties is that when you are a voter in your constituency, You're usually not voting for the individual MP. In some cases, you may not even know who your MP is. You're voting for a party. You're voting for the manifesto of that party.\n\nSay you're voting in 1997, you're voting to bring in new Labour, and you've read their manifesto or you've got some sense of it, You're expecting them to do the kinds of things that Tony Blair says they're gonna do. And if you wake up the next morning and find your Labour MP is deliberately voting against Tony Blair's policies repeatedly, so he can't get his policies through, you feel a bit disenfranchised. So there are strong arguments for why parties matter And why party discipline matters because it brings a bit of order and structure to what would otherwise be 50,000,000 individual voters and 650 individual MPs.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And, you know, we've talked recently both about Holland, the Netherlands, and Spain where It would seem that it's impossible to form a government. And when we talk about forming a government, when we have a general election and people say which party leader is able to quote former government, close quotes. That means, do they have enough people in the new House of Commons that can be expected to vote, particularly for a budget, but for other things that that party has been promising in a campaign. So I I I broadly agree with that.\n\nI think sometimes perhaps MP should be allowed a little bit more freedom in terms of what they say and do, but I think the broad approach that you're electing a party as well as an individual MP, I think still serves us reasonably well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and I think the way to resolve it is that you let the MPs rebel. I mean, I did rebel, but you put the cost on it quite high So that they rebel on 1 or 2 issues that really matter to them existentially. But the the public understands that looking at their voting record cord. Doesn't tell you very much because 95% of their votes, you can expect to be in line with their party. And when they really find something in the way that I did About a no deal Brexit.\n\nYep. At that point, they resigned from the government. They leave the cabinet. They rebel against their party. They get thrown out of their party, And they have to have the option to do that.\n\nOtherwise, you won't be able to stop extreme injustice, but there has to be that balance between freedom and discipline.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now United Nations Security Council, Asa Stanley, a few weeks ago, Rory said that if the United Nations Security Council was picked today, the UK would not be on it. Who would the major five be today if the council was going to be changed now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So I think that the normal argument is you'd give much bigger space to the BRICS Because they represent the big regional powers, Brazil and Latin America, India in Asia, obviously, China and Russia are already on the council, South Africa or Nigeria In Africa, because one of the fundamental problems at the moment is sub Saharan Africa is not represented at all. Latin America is not represented at all. South Asia is not represented at all, and that makes less and less sense given the populations and the economic size of these countries.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think the countries that would Think that they deserve a place would be India, Germany, Japan. Have I missed any? Brazil, Possibly. If it was being set up in terms of power today, I think, actually, if you were going to revisit it, perhaps you'd you'd sort of say, well, the only 2 I mean, you'd probably start a world war, which I don't think would be a very good idea.\n\nYou probably would kick off Russia and the UK and France.\n\nSpeaker 1: And bring in the EU?\n\nSpeaker 0: You bring in the EU on there. You probably have United States, European Union, China, and then a body that brought together some something that represented Africa and then Latin America. I think that's how you'd work it.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can have an African Union seat and a Latin American seat. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now listen. Here's my final one, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gone in.\n\nSpeaker 0: A bit lighter than what we we've been talking about. Charlie O'Neil, can Rory please share his favorite experience of Theresa May, I've got Alastair share his favorite experience of Gordon Brown. They are both good, hardworking PMs who were dealt a bad hand. So what's your favorite experience of Theresa May?\n\nSpeaker 1: My favorite experience, Theresa May, is when she was up in my constituency and seeing her come up as a very, very busy woman working the tables. She's she's not a big extrovert. She's quite quite an introverted person, but just showing the dedication late at night So getting around, meeting party members, listening to people, taking their experiences seriously. I felt in every engagement with her, Whether it was going to see her in the cabinet room when she was appointing me to a ministerial position or sitting in the cabinet with her around the table or the National Security Council, That this was somebody who was a serious human being doing her best. I I I was very, very proud to This is Servan Her government.\n\nOver to you on Gordon Brown. I'll tell\n\nSpeaker 0: you what, Rory. Because I'm very keen for both Theresa May and Gordon Brown to come on as guests of Leading, I'm going to link my favorite experience of Gordon Brown to a direct invitation to give me my tie back. Because on Gordon's last day as prime minister, and I'd been in there helping on the campaign and then was around for those rather strange days when the coalition was being put together. So when Gordon finally decided that, you know, he was calling it a day and he was gonna go and see the queen and and resign as prime minister, Gordon came down with Sarah, his wife, and these 2 boys, and he sort of said goodbye to people. And then Before he went out, he suddenly realized there was somebody pointing out to him that he's wearing a blue tie.\n\nAnd he thought, come back. Can't go out wearing a blue tie. And he looked around to see if anybody was wearing a red tie. I was wearing closest thing to a red tie. It wasn't quite Trumpian red but it was pretty red.\n\nSo we should maybe share a picture in the newsletter of Gordon walking out as he resigned from number 10 in Mai Tai. Now that was 13 years ago. Now, Gordon, I want my tie back. So I suggest that when you Sit down with me and Rory for an episode of Leading that we have the handover of the red tie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Final question, Johnny p. What books are you currently reading? What have you just finished reading? We haven't had any cultural recommendations for a while.\n\nSo while I give you a second to think about the answer, Johnny, the answer is because it's been a long time. I've been reading a lot of books. So here's a quick quick selection of books. Great book on trauma called The Body Keeps the Score by a person called Bessel van der Kolk, a novel called The General by c s Forrester who wrote the Hornblower series, which is about a 1st World War general. It's ironic, strange, moving, I think a really sort of weird, troubling insight Into the mentality of 1st World War generals recommended by my friend Mark Behan.\n\nIf people have young children and want a gentle way of Introducing at least those more interested in samurai into Japan. There's a great book I'm reading my children at the moment called Young Samurai by somebody called Bradford. People want politics things. I've been looking at this child will be great, which is Mesmerizing by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, an account of her Going through a coup d'etat, she becomes present in Liberia. But in 1980, she goes through a coup d'etat where all but 3 of her cabinet colleagues are lined up on posts on the beach and shot.\n\nAnd finally, a little shout out to Ben Reilly Smith, who's a telegraph correspondent, just written a book called right to rule, which I think you might find quite interesting, which is an attempt to answer The fundamental question, how on earth did the conservatives remain in power given the catastrophic catalog of errors over 13 years just just coming out? So over to you. Any thoughts from you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. In that one, you say catastrophic errors over 13. Is it a book saying never vote for them again? Because I definitely would read that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's he's a telegraph journalist, but it's a book saying it's a bit weird given everything that happened, austerity, Brexit, Liz Truss, That the conservatives remained in power. So it's a question of what is the resilience of the conservative party? What is it that against all the odds meant that they kept winning elections through that period.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I see. I've got it. I've got it. Okay. Now I have just finished a book which I think you would enjoy.\n\nTicoy. It was published 96 years ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: It was given to me as a gift by my editor of my book, which as you know is called\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Pub. It's called, but what can I do? I almost said politics on the edge. I said sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, so my editor, Nigel, when, But what can I do? Reach number 1? My editor Nigel decided this was worthy of some sort of celebration, so he dug into his collection of Very rare first editions because there used to be such a thing, Roy. There isn't anymore, but there there is such a thing as a rare first edition. And he found this book called the piper In Peace and War.\n\nAnd it's just fantastic. It's, as you know, I I love the bagpipes, but the bagpipes have been an instrument of war. Right. Do you know when the bagpipes ceased to be officially recognized as an instrument of war?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. When?\n\nSpeaker 0: 1996. Not till 1996. The Labour government should have reversed But it's full of stories of amazing heroism of pipers in war. So I thoroughly enjoy that, and I think you would. I'm reading a book called Das Leben ist gut.\n\nOh. Life is Good Gosh. By a guy called Alex Capus, c a p u s.\n\nSpeaker 1: And is that is that an ironic title or is it a self help book?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'm only halfway through. It's a book about a couple who have never spent a night apart, and the wife goes off to Paris for a week. Ah. And it's\n\nSpeaker 1: still the guy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well well, we don't know whether he\n\nSpeaker 1: is his date. Goodness gracious me. I think we know what's gonna happen there.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think I don't think that's the road it's going to go down, but it's one of those things where the guy who runs a bar, he's he's also a writer, but he runs a bar. And where I am at the moment is just sort of reflecting all these different personalities who come into his bar, but I'm thoroughly enjoying it. And then the other book I read recently, also Alf Deutsch, It's called Der Anhalta. But if I told you that the author was Lee Child you'll probably realize that it's That is a translation of a book that Lee Child wrote called The Hitchhiker.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've taken to reading Agatha Christian French because that's about the level of language I can do. And Shoshana, my wife, is reading Harry Potter in Arabic.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, wow. The other thing to tell you is that if you want a good French Novelists that I think if your French is not sort of mega good, but I think you would really like is Amelie Notame. She's a wonderful writer and but she writes in very, very clear simple French.\n\nSpeaker 1: People looking for things to listen to, I really recommend fantastic recordings by Gareth Armstrong, who's an English actor, of Maigret, Georges Simonon's Maigret novels, and I've been through 7 of these so far. And Gareth Armstrong beautifully uses English accents tickets. To capture different French personality types without you really noticing that seamless transition, and it's fantastically translated. And, Simon, I mean, it's I'm still staggered by the man. He wrote something like 500 books.\n\nHe was generating 9 or 10 of these a year, and every one of them would have taken me 2 years to write at that kind of quality.\n\nSpeaker 0: Have I mentioned before Wendy Joseph, the Old Bailey judge?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. You've not. Was you\n\nSpeaker 0: talking about listening? Because we actually listened to this recently on a long drive up to the Lake District. Wendy Joseph, Old Bailey Judge, and her book is called Unlawful Killings. And it's written like a series of short stories, really, because it's she takes cases that she's been involved in. She disguises names and so forth.\n\nBut It's beautifully written, but it also gives you a sense of the complexities of what goes in to a murder trial and the and the the number of lives that are affected by that. And she comes over as an incredibly sort of Empathetic, sensitive woman. But you really get a feeling for, you know how when we're following court cases and you sort of, You know, you think, oh, well, he's obviously guilty or he's not guilty, whatever. It really takes you into the complexities of the of the stories and the situations and and, ultimately, the judgments that she has to make.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I think we're gonna get in huge trouble from our very intimidating producer, Dom, who if people could see him, I think they would be scared, but, Luckily, it's an audio presentation. He's gonna be telling us off for giving more book recommendations, as you'd say, than the British Library.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's not how he's that's not how he speaks. He doesn't talk at all like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Shut up, boys. Leave it till next week.\n\nSpeaker 0: He's also a Manchester City supporter. And as you know, Rory, Manchester City are set to lose their 1st game of the season because they're playing against\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, wait. Wait. Wait. They're playing against Richmond FC, Ted Lasso's club?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. They're playing badly. Have you watched Ted Lasso?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have. I love it. I love it. I love it. Absolutely love it.\n\nDo you like it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yes. I do. I I love the positivity and and because usually watching stuff about football, Actors just can't do football because they're not good at all. Well, actually, they do it they do it pretty well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are they playing football okay? How do they how do they actually play the football? Are the are the actors Just being forced to actually pass the ball, or they got stunt\n\nSpeaker 0: doubles? Yeah. They do. I think they do a bit of that, and they they have a bit of stunt double, and they have a bit of CGI and all that stuff. AI, Rory, it's you know, AI is gonna take over more.\n\nWe've been watching something called The Offer, which is about the making of The Godfather. And as a result of which, having watched it, we rewatched The Godfather because it's 50 years now since The Godfather, And it was kind of okay. It was it was a bit bit dated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really? Did Marlon Brando remind you a bit of Dom, our producer, that terrifying figure who keeps intervening? No. When Don says, Rory, I'm gonna make you an offer.\n\nSpeaker 0: I wasn't I I found Al Pacino more convincing than Marlon Brando. And, also, I know it was all part of the app, but I couldn't quite often I mean, I'm 66 now, and maybe it's just my hearing, but I I couldn't really work out what he was saying a lot of the time. And I think it's awful when you're watching films in your own language and you wanted want subtitles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Want the subtitles. My my sister once said, that she felt with one of her boyfriends that she'd she'd got together with the young Marlon Brando and ended up with the old Marlon Brando.\n\nSpeaker 0: Anyway, the offer the offer's quite good. Although, it was based on a book by somebody called Albert Ruddy, who was also the executive producer of the series. And the one thing I'll say about the series is that Albert Ruddy, who produced The Godfather, comes out as an utterly heroic figure. Extraordinary. Amazing.\n\nAmazing. Absolutely amazing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Sounds good. A bit like me in politics on the edge. Right. Okay.\n\nHere we get to Wrap. Thank you very much, Alice, for this, and it's a goodbye to everyone from Jordan and my slightly never again for some time when you hear the call to prayer Or the gas van driving past playing its own ice cream tune.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright, guys. Lovely to talk to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Bye bye.",
