To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show tickets. Just go to the rest is politics .com. That's the rest is politics.com. Welcome to The Rest is Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Mister Campbell, alongside our 1st serving prime minister guest on the rest of his politics. We've had a former prime minister, Tony Blair. We've had a hopefully future prime minister, Keir Starmer. We've had a former future prime minister, William Hague, and now we have you. And one of the reasons we have you is that I'm well aware that you're a regular listener to the rest of his politics, And you particularly enjoyed the interview with William Hague, which is the one interview which Rory Stewart has managed to secure so far. I think it was the The best episode of this of the series, because It's not at all, something you can get often nowadays. So gracious, so insightful, And, so humble, man coming from so long Live in politics. But so what did you see as his insights? It was very insightful about The state of affairs nowadays, it was very insightful about Russia, about China, also very interesting. It's very insightful, about the, the inner struggles of someone who is in politics and who has this, permanent, challenge to be in or to get out and when is the time to get out and How much you can stay in and so on and so further. So, if I if I would say it all, I would say although he didn't beat Tony Blair, in the life after politics, he seemed happier than Tony Blair. So let's let's let's follow-up with this prime minister. So you you I mean, you you're an extraordinary example of this. You're unusual, very unusual as a politician. You were a very leading, artist, Serious professional artist, and a serious international basketball player as well as sportsman before you became, a politician. How how do you think about politics? How do you know when you've been in long enough? How do you know when your Mind is beginning to become adversely affected. What do you think are the the strains of being a politician? First of all, I have to To set the record straight, I was not a serious international basketball player. I was, I was a mediocre national basketball player. And The reason why I played basketball, first of all, was my asthma, because, my parents thought that It was, it was good for me to play basketball to fight my asthma, which is which was true. Secondly, the reason why I was taken and Make all the way to the national team was because I was particularly tall in that time, particularly short Albania. And, thirdly, yes, I tried to be up to the task, but I would not So at all, except that I was an internationally series basketball player. Played few international games, from the bench From the bench, but, at the end, it was a fantastic experience of understanding Team ship, understanding leadership, understanding solidarity, and, and also conflict done so many things that sports gives to you. While me being here today as prime minister interviewed by Alastair Campbell is another miracle of life because, I would not have been in politics if Alastair Campbell would not exist. And if, Tony Blair would not exist, and if Third Way would not exist, and if new labor would not exist. So, the Time I saw myself, I had a mirage of myself being in in Somewhere in politics was when I was in Paris, buying a newspaper, the aftermath of the victory of the new labor. And then things happened in a way that, I was I was back in Tirana to bury my father, Leaving as an artist in Paris, it was the same day that there was a reshuffle of government. So, what could not happen anywhere else And can happen always in the Balkans is that you go to bury your father and become minister of culture. And then, the rest is known. Yeah. Well, so a little bit on that then. So your father was a sculptor in what seems to be a sort of socialist realist Style. He studied in Moscow. He came back to Albania, and he did kind of big socialist heroic sculpture sculptures. Is that right? Very much a product of the Albanero of the time. Yes. My father was one of the most, prominent official Sculptures of the regime. Yeah. He was part of this group of sculptures that basically Made the most important monuments, professionally, absolutely, respectful, but, So ideologically and also in terms of, the methods, absolutely something that I was fully against. So with my father, we had a very strong but also very intense relation in the sense that, I didn't like anything, he he did, and he didn't really want me to do anything I I did because, he he was more afraid of, me ending up badly. But, I value very much this relation because he was a liberal he was a liberal person. He never tried to impose, me doing anything. Yeah. Just following up on this a little bit. Was he somebody who you think was genuinely passionately committed to the idea of international communism? Did he genuinely believe in Albania's policies in the seventies in relation to China, or was he more pragmatic? He understood where power lay. He wanted to make his art, and so he compromised. I mean, when you interacted with him as a young person at the dinner table, was there a lot of Ideological conversation? I believe that, there were many like him that, came from, poor Or let's say, not rich families and had the chance to get out, look the world, be be in Soviet Union have their studies, be inspired by this, you know, revolutionary flame Coming back to build, to build the paradise on Earth and then slowly understanding that they were participating in the building on of the hell on Earth. And so, I don't think that he was any more passionate when I could when I could have, let's say conversations that I could analyze in a certain age, but I think, it was a very it was a very strong combination between inertia and, an amount of fear, An amount of, practicality because at the end, you know, we were totally isolated from west, from east. We were North Korea of Europe. So, many many of them, people that, when they were younger, embrace communism as As an inspiration, as an ideal, turned to be, practically, people that were, you know, that gave up In their own silence. So but on the other hand, this this was part of me being involved in the anti Communist movement in the arts academy and which was practically the seeds of what then became my political per year. But, like, you didn't really answer Rory's question about whether you think politics has has changed you or whether because Rory talks a lot on the podcast about how he felt that his political Korea almost dehumanized him. It dehumanizes a lot of people in in politics as to whether you think it's changed you fundamentally and also whether you Know when you'll be ready to to leave and move on. You've now won 3 elections, which is pretty rare in the modern age. Maybe may I don't think Rory got in this conclusion while he was still in politics. I think after leaving politics, he started to realize that he was somehow handicapped And started to see that something was missing, here. Something was missing there for from the pieces he know he had Before entering politics. I don't know. I have to make this checkup when I get out. But, I think that, in one way, doing art in the same time, helps me, to keep some balance, to keep some sanity. And, in the same time, yes, politics makes you more and more, keen to forget about sentiments and, more and more, taken by results, results, results. And, of course, there is something something, a kind of, a kind of, for barbarization of your soul. I should say, Roy, Eddie doodles endlessly while he's in meetings, and his wallpaper is just a collection of his of his of his best doodles. But but you're quite, he's quite but you're quite quite a serious painter. I I mean, I I've been looking at some of your work. Are you Are you you're still doing serious painting or or less than when you were in Paris? Listen. The most serious part of my paintings, in my art It's the part that I didn't do it seriously, which, is the part that I did, while I was engaged in politics as business of culture, Sitting in the government meetings, I have never entered a government building until becoming minister of culture. As an artist, I never Wanted to enter a government building or an office or whatever. Never had an office life. And so I couldn't stand the long hours of the council of minister, So I was doodling and doodling and doodling and doodling, and my, colleague, minister of education was near me, telling me after every session, can I take it? Can I take it? And he took and took and took. And one day, I go to visit him and I, for some other reason. And, at the end, he says to me, do you want to see my art collection? I said, we have an art collection. And he has a whole portfolio with my doodles. And when I see them all together, I realized that there was something there. And I go back, at To my office, very sad, very, very down. The guy was under some charges at the time, and I said to my assistant, I am Afraid that I will prove that he is a thief. He has stolen all my art. And, she said, no. You have much more. And she opened her Her shelf, it was full of doodles. I was doing all the time in office without even even and then, she conspired with a friend from the academy, Former friend in the arts academy, they brought some doodles, in a exhibition, and then, this started to get to get out, and then a German gallerist came to me to see me because he saw the book I did. Just for our listeners, just so that they can understand what you're talking about. So when you say doodle, people imagine it's like They take their biro pen, and they draw a little smiley face in the bottom of their meeting agenda. But your doodles are completely different. Your doodles are, For example, a Google diary sheet, and you will have written some numbers across it, but then over the top is the most extraordinarily complex Pieces of art, incredible numbers of different colors. I mean, there are I see vegetable forms, birds. Because it's part of hours and hours in office, meetings and meetings. And, while I am focused On the on talking with the people that are in front of me or are in the phone, my hand and my eyes continue to do their job to somehow, Keep Me Balance. And, that's why they are and and their sophistication depends a lot from the length of the time spent In office or for the length of the meeting. So, I'm also very very proud to be I am on this wallpaper on a horse with a mobile phone in one hand and a sword in the other. It was, the this this, this drawing of Alastair in my wallpaper was premonitory of, of the incursion, the crusade would make against Boris Johnson, you know, because, his iPhone, and his, sword and his horse Yeah. Is known. So I I have a wonderful Friend who's a great political supporter who sent me there's a a Rembrandt picture that that maybe you know of a a young man in a sort of Polish Cossack horse costume Riding on a on a horse through a legendary landscape with a crumbling castle on the background, and he sent this to me also to try to inspire me to ride against Boris Johnson. So maybe there's a There's a cavalry theme coming through. I I don't and so, Eddie, you've raised Boris Johnson, not me. Okay? No. I simply don't. You raised Boris Johnson. Yeah. So just tell me when I every time because this This this this is Alistair in on the horse with his sword and his iPhone is in in front of my eyes many times. And, every time I used to see it, I used To just pity Boris, to have, behind him someone so obsessed to kill him as soon as possible. So your assessment now of let's just go through a couple of current things and then come on to your assessment of where we are as a country and where you are as a country. So first of all, you've had this extraordinary situation with Iran, cyber attack Yeah. That you've had to respond to pretty vigorously. We've also got the issue of the spike in Albanians crossing the channel in small boats, which has become a problem for both your government and ours. And then I think also just briefly on what your assessment of Britain in the world is now. We've had we've had this British week in Albania, lots of good cooperation, but I'd be interested in your take post Brexit. And finally, your assessment of Albania's place in the world, which, you know, you have massive progress, but you've also got big challenges you're still facing. So take us through all of that. So the Iran thing has to do with a heavy cyber attack, on us, that we worked very, very thoroughly to Understand who was behind it, and the attribution is not based on, assessments that come from, you know, speculation, but is based on a forensic, on proofs and on the hard work of some Super special teams that we had with us from Microsoft, from, US, even UK Experts, had to look in it. So we had 100% proof that the Public, Islamic Republic of Iran was behind it, so we had to retaliate with the severance of our diplomatic ties. And why would they do it? We think because we we have sheltered here, some thousands of For refugees that are not, amicable to their regime to say the least. And we did it, In a fully humanitarian basis, they were in camp liberty in Iraq. They were massacred and raided every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks by the Iranian service, and kids and women were killed. So, we accepted to shelter them. Albania has always been, you know, keen to to give shelter to people, to People in trouble, we have done it during 2nd World War. Albania was the only country to have more Jews after the war than before. And with a clean record of no one Jew, delivered to the Nazis by by an Albanian, family or citizen, then we we we sheltered, half a 1000000, Kosovars, you know, because you were part of that, that, epic epic moment. And then, the Afghans. The Afghans that were, were left Behind, in that mass of Kabul, Kabul airport and the Getting out of the NATO forces without really having had a plan, what we'll do for them who Who worked for us there, who stood for us, who believed in us. And I I I found this was not good not right. You know? So We opened the doors for some thousands of Afghans. And, so it's in our it's in our DNA, let's say. And we don't regret it, and we'll Do it again and again and again because, you know, in the same time, we have been once in need to be sheltered from others. So we left Albania, not from, from Islamic or a Taliban, religious regime, but from an atheist regime. We were 1,000 with the boats going to Italy to ask for Help for food, for shelter. And, we are here today, in this A new stage of our history because someone helped us before. So In small boats? Small boats, is a is a sad story, frankly. Although it's an unclear story because there are numbers we see in the British media that do not really match with the numbers we see, in our own sites or this increase, there was a very interesting article in The Guardian that, was So somehow questioning these numbers. But beyond that, we need to know from where these People coming. They are Albanians. Yes. But they're Albanians from Albania. Albanians from Kosovo. They're Albanians from other Albanian areas. They are coming From Albania or they are coming from France or they're coming from, Greece or from Italy. We had the same situation with France some some time ago. We had the same situation with Germany some time ago. And when Germany declared the Safe origin and, simply didn't accept anymore to put the people in an asylum seeking procedure by giving them funds, social Assistance, house, and so on. They moved to France, and now they are moving towards England. So, it's very important to to understand, but this being said, we we we we are cooperating with the British authorities. We are setting some operations to take all to take all the the the traffickers because the the the terrible part of it is that So this goes this is a very lucrative business for traffickers. And But do do you have any understanding why it is suddenly just these numbers have gone up in the way that they have? You never, you there's always it's always like a like a rumor coming out, and then some are going, and then some relatives there are calling. And then, the no the the noise is that, in Britain, you have now some opportunity because there is a there is a vacuum created there. We can feel it. So it's, it's it's how it works. I just wanted to to sort of shift around for a moment and talk a little bit about perceptions of Albania and the way prime minister that you're Perceived internationally and in Britain. So you reprimanded me because I think you heard me talk on the podcast. In an earlier session, I was referring The corruption in Albania and organized crime in Albania and all this kind of thing. So you then got in touch, I think, through Alastair, to say that I was providing a very negative, portrait of the country. But I wanted to see your reflections on this in some some way because, obviously, we read media. We go online. We read about Albania, and Certainly, even as a even as a minister, I'm afraid, you know, when we were dealing with the home office and the prison system, Albania did not have a very strong reputation on these things. So It would be interesting to know a little bit about what is correct, what is incorrect, and help us navigate ourselves a bit. First of Paul, you should have known already after so many, episodes that when I listen to pass a message message, there is always a spin. I I I didn't, I didn't blame you, And I never deny that we have, problems with corruption, and we have, also problems with crime, because we are not yet in a stage of a modern country that provides for the citizens, all the service and all the All the standards that make corruption unnecessary because corruption at the end, when, it comes to To developing countries is an alternative of, the state. It's a it's a service that is given in a not legal way, because the state is, somehow being late or being, lazy or being unable to give the this service Prime minister, can I can I interrupt for a second? Sorry. The this is a historical question, but was this, was organized crime and corruption a big issue Under communism before 89, or is it something that largely occurred because of the breakdown of that system in 89? No. During communism, we never heard about So the word corruption, word corruption came with a new vocabulary. In my in my in my memory, I don't recall to have heard the word corruption. Crime, yes. There were some, you know, petite crime, but organized crime, no. Because Organized crime by definition is, is, transnational. So, It has to do with trafficking. It has to do with smuggling. It has to do with, a lot of activities that imply borders, imply interactions. So we didn't have that. But we didn't have many other things during communism. For example, Albania was, I think the country with the lowest heart attacks in the world because Lowest heart attacks? Yes. Because our cholesterol was, 0 because we didn't have too much to eat, and we were on vegetables, No meat, no alcohol, no nothing. So, we were a country with no heart attacks. So heart attacks and cholesterol came with democracy. This is this is the Britain of the future, Roy. It's another 12 years of the tourism industry. And organized crime came with democracy. So these are Part of this part. This being said, I think we have done incredible, incredible work, and we have we have achieved incredible results, in fighting exactly this type of corrupt because corruption, in in in a in a in a scale of of undermining the the law for bigger for big profit is everywhere. The problem with developing countries, which Which you don't find in developed countries is that corruption touches everyone. So it touches you as a citizen when you Want the service touches you as a as a father or or a parent when you want your kid to go to the school he or she deserves, touches you as a Young guy getting out of university when he want to have a job. So corruption interferes everywhere. And I think we have beaten corruption in many ways, in that level. The cyber attack was very, very, heavy heavily damaging Because it shut down the digital services. We have today 95% of the services That until yesterday were given in long lines implying a lot of, bribery in, in the in the cloud, so in digital. So you you don't see anyone. You don't need to talk to anyone in your iPhone. You ask for a license. You ask for permission. You ask for Your medical status, you ask for more than a 1000 things, and, you get them online. So the this means that all this part of corruption is gone for the people. But how far where you were when you came in 3 elections ago or where you need to be in these and other issues, for example, to be considered seriously for entry in the European Union. How far along that road do you think you are? If we see, Albania today with the eyes of from where we started, it's like day and night. If we see Albania tomorrow from the ice where we are, it's night and day. So we need to make, a lot A lot yet, and to it's a long way. And how you had a very, very good relationship with Angela Merkel. Has that continued with Schultz? Do you still feel the Germans are very, very supportive? I have to tell you one thing that is, is not a joke. It's a real thing. When I met Schultz, in Angela's office, and, I sat in front of him for some minutes. I was, in a very strange state of mind because I was thinking it was she presenting herself as a man in front of me. Really? Same same same same posture, Same place of the hands, same way of looking, same way of reacting, Same same pace of the voice. The moment I realized it was not, it's not it was not her, but it was not was him, was when he said, I'm I'm very committed to bring, Albania and the Western Balkans in the EU during my mandate. She would never said that. But she was doing it? No. But, because it needs time. You know? It it needs a lot of time. And then I said, okay. About how many Mondays you you you you you are gonna win to do that? No. I mean, he's a lot of continuity. I think it's totally unfair to criticize him based on the comparison with Angela when she left. And I believe if people try to remember Angela in her 1st months in office, I'm sure she She and would be again the same. So, she was not the Angela we know now. She was much more Fragile, much more secure, much more you know? So, I think he he has, he has all to be to be Angela all the way. Premise, tell us about Angela at her peak. I mean, you're an admirer of her. What what is it you think made her do you think she's the greatest European politician of this decade? Ma'am, maybe in this decade, it's it's very easy to be the best in Europe. Competition not not very big. Yes. I think she Saved, the honor of Europe and the honor of our civilization, the moment she stood very strong In front of the huge wave of refugees, in 2015, this was amazing. Against all polls, against all public opinions, against all The fears and the unknown, she stood, and, this was an incredible, moment of, of Feeling the privilege to know her. And then I think, yes, she was, she was great, in a sense that she never, spoke, wishful thinking. She always prepared herself. She always stick to the facts. She always try to be truthful. She never and, you know, I think Angela Merkel, was someone you could not charm. She You couldn't charm her? You couldn't charm. She was someone that didn't need, didn't feel the need to be charmed. You know? She was very gentle, very kind, but being uncharmable is the highest, level of the respect and of self awareness And the dignity, I think it's it's it's amazing. She will she was not some someone you would charm. So the 4 points the 4 questions I laid out earlier, you dealt with 3 of them, but not Britain. So you mentioned there of those qualities you've just outlined for Angela Merkel, how many of them would apply to our recently departed prime minister? He wants me he wants to bring me the horse. You know? You know, this you you you you're talking about paintings. You know, there is another famous painting, you know, with this, with a death, with a young, lady in the horse. So Alistair now wants me to be the young lady that, with the innocent face of, talking about of of a poor Albanian, prime minister Sir, tell us how horrible Boris Johnson was, but I'm not gonna get in your trap. No? Yeah. But but but the answer the answer is you wouldn't say any of those things about him that you said about Aguilar. Otherwise, you'd have said them. Tell us about recent French leaders compared to recent German leaders. How do you think they rate compared to German leaders in in their conduct in the last decade? I think I think, Emmanuel Macron has another problem. People, especially in France, They really don't know who he really is, and, it's a pity that he cannot transmit When, he's in public, how how interesting he is, how human he is, how How much respectful he is of, of, people. How how curious he is to listen. It's it's really incredible, you know, to have the President of France, write text you out of the blue and say, how you see things? Tell me. What do you think? Like this. So it means that he's, someone, absolutely, a lot maybe not absolute, but a lot different from what the French thing that he's an arrogant Boy that doesn't really feel, people. He doesn't really, care about anything else than the rich. It's not true at all. You know? He's someone with a vision, with ambition, you know, but I don't know what's what's missing that, doesn't make the right connection with people. You you as you you mentioned, the Tony Blair's government's role in relation to Kosovo. And we've talked before, and I've been always very interested by your assessment of Kosovo in terms of where the Balkans was then and where it is now, but also your view that Putin repeats, repeats the word Kosovo many times. Especially, since the war started, he speaks, about Kosovo many times because, in his mind, his idea of the Of the international law, Kosovo is, the mirror where every 1 who participated in its liberation should see his own hypocrisy While talking about Crimea, in his mind, Kosovo, is the biggest Example of how the western world's, America and its allies broke Brutally international law. And, Crimea in his mind is the the detector of this big hypocrisy. And and more than Iraq, you feel, in his mind? For Iraq, he has, he has, of course, The convention that was in breach of international law. But, when it comes to Kosovo, it's much it's much more it's much more, to him, a twin case of, Crimea. So a land that was taken from one state In the name of the people living there while, Crimea is the land, taken back to, the state where it belongs in the name of people living there. So, And and and, probably, so just on that one, for our listeners, particularly American, British listeners, The situation in the Western Balkans is something that people talk about, but there's very, very little covered. Is it something that people should be anxious about? Is it people that that Policymakers in Washington and London should be focused more on. In this in this moment, I'm less I'm less preoccupied. I was very preoccupied in the beginning because Western Balkans. First of all, I think, that European Union is the only Geographical reality in the history of the maps with 1 outside border and 1 inside border. And within this Inside border is the Western Balkans. So you cannot enter the Western Balkans without entering EU. And you have to Enter you and to get out of EU to be in the Western Balkans. And you cannot get out of Western Balkans Without reentering EU. So it's like, it's like having a stomach within your body, but But, somehow, somehow, circumscribed it with the border. And and prime minister, sorry. And, professor, I'm being going to be just interrupt for a second for our listeners just to remind them that we're talking here about some of the tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo. Now within this this, borders, we within EU, Russia has its most So, it's most, obvious influence from Republic of Serbia in Bosnia to Serbia itself To, Montenegro partly and to North Macedonia. So, let's say in this, Slav orthodox world, there is a lot of Russian influence. And, to give you an example, in Albania, Vladimir Putin popularity is 0.7%. So So 0.67% of Albanians think that Putin is right. 99.3% think that Putin is wrong. While in Serbia, 80% of Serbs think that Putin is a hero showing his bolts to the west. And, I was predefined because put of course, put in try to use its influence to disrupt here in the Western Balkans. And this could happen in a certain way easy if the west would push Serbia beyond a certain limit to sanction Russia. Serbia cannot sanction Russia because physically is impossible. They cannot leave a day without the Russian gas. Secondly, because of public opinion. So, asking from Serbia too much, too fast Would could have been disastrous for the Western Balkan because this this would disrupt a process we have started in In the Western Balkan of collaboration, building peace, open Balkan initiative, and all this. Serbia, made a long way on the other side because, it was a huge surprise. They voted 3 times against Russia and the United Nations, even Yes. To expel Russia from the human rights committee. So as far as this sanction thing will not be, will not be So pressuring to break it, I'm not much better by it. Are you happy about being within the context, again, of getting to the European Union, that you and Serbia, in a sense, have to develop in different ways, but at the same time. And is your relationship with Serbia good? It's not a matter of being happy. It's a matter of, finally having understood that, you don't pick your neighbors and your neighbors are there to stay. So, the choice is very, very clear. Or you look for trouble and troubles will hit you and will make Your life more difficult or you look for peace and cooperation? So, working in this second direction, We can see much more benefits for the future, and we can build the peace we need. While the first direction has, taught us for 100 of years that the end is, is is cruelly unjust for for the next generations. We talked about Russia in in the Western Balkans, New York. But, of course, people will also talk about China and Hungary, and I'd be very interested to see whether there is, You know, often, if you were reading an article in New York Times, if you talked about Western Balkans, you would put Russia, China, and Hungary together as potentially anti western forces operating the Western Balkans. Listen. Because of our history, in Albania, we have a very particular situation. In our history, We, had Stalin here standing in the main square until 1990. So, our our, guys thought that Khrushchev was too soft or that the Soviet Union, Empire was a bunch of traitors that they, abandoned Stalin. And with that, they gave up the cause. So they left The Soviet Bloc, they left the Warsaw Treaty, and they went to China. And they went to China and China, and we got with Stalin Also the worst of China, the cultural revolution, of the sixties. So, this made Albania a place where no Russia and neither China are really, seen like, the saviors, like, what we desperately need. And, practically, we we are a country that is 100% renewables. We we are based, our our electricity is Fully based on hydro production, so we don't have Russian gas. We don't have Russia here in any shape or form, only with an embassy That, has removed lately because we named the road of the embassy for Ukraine. And, their envelopes So we're coming, Russian embassy for Ukraine, Russian embassy for Ukraine. So now we have moved in another place, and I heard from the mayor that he wants to move the name to that place. Let's see what will what will happen. China is, is, He's also not very present in Albania. We have a normal relation, but not that much. But beyond that, I have to bring the attention on one point. In Europe, they speak more and more about geopolitics. They speak more and more about western western Balagans. Speak more and more about Not letting what they call 3rd actors to fill the void. And guess what? There the pandemic comes. They are all, in their, in their moment of uncertainty. And, they gather and they distribute vaccines within the EU countries, and no one does comes to us. So we are, as I said, in the middle of Europe, and we are connected to the European life in all ways with people leaving Europe, with TVs from Europe. And we felt like, fish is out of water. And what what we did, we ran to Turkey, to China, and to Russia. And it was Turkey, that provided vaccine for Albanians. It was China that provided vaccines for Serbia And, other parts, it was Russia that provided some to some others. So, without these 3, these 3 heads, The devil, let's say, would not have survived. So now The Europe the European Union, you you would argue made a mistake. European Union made a shameful mistake, And then they started to bring vaccines. Now and I said to them, when we were back in the council, don't do it again with the energy crisis. If you have a package to support the countries of European Union with extra money to mitigate the huge cost of the energy, Don't let the Balkans out because it will be another another example of, saying something and meaning something else and doing something Completely different. So you still desperately want to get into the European Union. What is your assessment of Britain's role in the world? Listen. We we we have, It's it's it's the first time in in our history that we have chosen with our free will where where we want to be. For centuries, we have been where we didn't choose and where we were not asked under different regimes, in a in a different places, but never where we belong, which is, let's say, the western civilization. And, in 1990, when the anti regime movement succeeded, the slogan was we want Albania like Europe. So being in Europe is for us to be in a safe place and to be in a place where people count, not where, others decide for you. Sometimes, you know, it's embarrassing to to to be to to have to answer a question. Britain is leaving. You're entering. It feels a bit like, you know, divorcing and telling to young men in love, don't marry. It doesn't work. You know? Everyone has to go through the marriage to realize that maybe it's not so so amazing. So divorcing has never stopped others to marry. And and some and some marriages work. There are even cases when second marriages Work. So maybe Britain will come back one day to remarry with Europe. It looks like impossible today, but, So maybe one day, they'll rethink of it because, you know, being alone, surrounded by water, it's not always so so So amusing. Prime minister, I had a a a I'm I've been fascinated by this visual image you've given us, which is It's this Northern Renaissance painting by Hans Baldung called the knight, death, and the maiden. And for the for the readers who are, listeners who are not haven't seen the painting, Essentially, it's a night on a horse But for the main time in a row, he's talked about our readers. Right? Rory, just podcast, listen. Books, read. Okay. I need to get this straight in my head. Okay. So we we have a picture. Early 16th century. We have a knight on a horse. We have a maiden grabbing onto the night, and then we have death with his teeth grabbing onto the skirt of the maiden's the maiden's skirt. And you were you were expressing yourself as Seizing like the maiden onto Alastair Campbell the night as he rides away with death trying to chew onto your onto your skirt. I wondered what direction you you think you and Alastair can ride in the future. If not against Boris Johnson, what would be an exciting direction for the 2 of you to go on your horse? Are you doing a 4th term? I don't know. It's, it's, it's all to be seen. And, and the great thing with Alastair, Which, I think it's shown also by this podcast is that, he's very successful in things, that Even him does not expect before. So I'm sure that he'll find something else to to do when it comes To do something together, and, I'll be very pleased to to embark with him and his horse. But please not to To kill another conservative prime minister. This, he can this is he can do with his own, not with me. Well, listen. Thank you for your time. Thank you. I didn't realize that that is what got you into politics. I've never heard you say that before, but that was the whole new labor thing, third way. Yeah. The the This was, the most this was the biggest inspiration. It was like a mirage. I didn't decide at that moment, but I, Tony Blair, I end with this, this, young, new politician Coming and breaking, breaking the old house with this completely new spirit and, this wave of change and this rock star, you know, type, of, of Communication and all this. And then I started to follow and follow and follow all the way. And, practically, The first thing I did when I became leader of the party, I I started the 3rd way the 3rd way thing and The 1 men, 1 vote process and many more. And I'm and and I'm happy to see, that third way still works For them who are not afraid of it and, especially for them who, are not in denial of it. It has been So big pain to see, the Labor Party, going in a very incomprehensible denial of, what the achievements were, for of of the new labor, and I hope now it's, it's a moment that we can recover. Well, thank you so much, prime minister. Thank you for your time. We really appreciate it. Thank you, Rory. Thank you, Alastair. It was an honor to be to be in this Wonderful. Country's chart topping podcast. It is wonderful version of the House of Commons. If the House of Commons was like your podcast, I'm sure People be enchanted again of politics. Maybe. Would you like to say a final word to the supporters of Burnley Football Club, your English team? Burnley Football Club. I I was so I was so shocked when Alistair, we are do said to me yesterday, we are doing well. We are 4th or 5th in the championship, I said I said how how the bar can be so low. I I I don't understand, but Right. Without that biggest cuts, we don't ever insult Burnley Football Club on this podcast. Thank you for your time. So, Marie, what do you think of that? Well, firstly, thank you. I mean, I thought that was really, really fun To to meet the prime minister of Albania, get a sense of his history and stuff. I I guess it's a bit tricky, isn't it, interviewing somebody from a completely different country because I'll be very aware that opposition politicians in Albania will be very disappointed that we were not tougher Mhmm. And harder. And I'm vaguely aware in the back of my mind that there are still massive issues around organized crime and corruption, and I don't know how to push that. And we're trying to get the balance right between being polite and respectful, and I don't really know enough. I mean, I did think, though, he is a great, great charmer. I thought he he's incredibly articulate. He's got a lovely manner. He's very learned, and I can see why you like him so much. Look. We could have sort of run him ragged over Albania dominating the cocaine market in the UK and whether they've been tough enough in the past, and we could have done that. But the The thing is I also know because I also don't forget I've seen him being interviewed a lot. He's he's and he has followed the Tony Blair rule book in many, many ways. And one of them, he's very good at doing interviews where he's where people are trying to put him on the defensive. And I just think that if you've got time to I think for our listeners, you won't know many of whom won't know that Hutch about Albania. Although we do apparently have 22,200 moderately regular listeners to the podcast in Albania, aren't you, Tayroy? But I think that they'll be interested in you know, I I when I was talking to somebody the other day and said, you know, I've I've been to come into Albania on for over a decade ever since before he became prime minister and and literally said, I don't know any he said, I don't know anything about Albania. And, like, you know, when it so when you say things like, you know, Enver Hochsia or you know? Then when you mentioned Dua Lipa and Rita Ora, and you say there's a kind of Albanian connection, and then suddenly their their sort of vague interest is. So I think what he was talking, putting it in that context of geopolitics as well, that's what that's what I like talking to you about. I think he's got a very good geopolitical And, and, also, he is. He's you know, he said the point right at the end about about how sad he has found it to see the Labour Party, particularly under You know, after Gordon went, that Ed Miliband and then particularly under Jeremy Corbyn, to see it sort of move away from the political values and source of policies that inspired him to go into politics. And, you know, we have done 3 campaigns together now, and we've we've used a lot of the new labor principles, and he's, You know, he's won all 3. To to get it done. Yeah. I mean, I've also I'm fascinated, but it's so difficult, isn't it, with serving politicians to get Honest answers to problems. So one of the things I'd be interested in, I'm very interested in countries with a lot of corruption, organized crime, is How dangerous is it to be a prime minister or a minister? I mean, how much freedom have you got to are you actually in a situation where if you really alienate these people, Will they come along and kill you? I mean, I remember talking to a Jamaican politician who was leaving Jamaican politics because he quite literally said he was gonna be murdered if he continued. I had dinner with Eddie in a restaurant, last night, and almost the the number of police cars and security that were around the place seems to have gone up since when he took office. I don't know what that's about. But, yeah, I I think that you you you I guess that is does have to be sort of part of it, but I I I I do think that that He understands the importance of Albania's image in the world, and I think has made efforts to to tackle that. And, you know, we're I'm with Dom, the producer of the podcast who's been with us last couple of days, first time in Tirana, and I think he's been absolutely gobsmacked by what Tirana like and feels like and how vibrant and buzzy and clean and and all the rest of it. He's nodding. My friend Emma's just been on holiday. He just thinks it's absolutely Beautiful. And they're they're I mean, he's doing very, very well on the PR. I mean, if you my favorite journal, The New York Times, if you Go through their stuff in Albania. There's lots of stuff about, you know, a largely unexplored corner of Europe with 265 miles of coastline, High end waterside resorts and lovely stuff about how Tirana's becoming a creative haven for artists. Well, tourism's going really well in in Toronto. And, listen, I recommend Albania for holidays to regularly to people, particularly young people who are maybe looking for you know, not to get broke on the back of a good holiday. And, honestly, they I've yet to have anyone come back other than absolutely totally impressed. And I've been here dozens of times now, and I always enjoy it. And I don't think he hides the problems, but I do think this is the divorce. You got a problem. You know? Clearly, this is what we're referring to in the boats, is that there are still young people who want to leave, and, that that is because some of these economic and social challenges. It's still a a very, very poor country comparatively, I mean, if you compare it to a country like Germany. And Yeah. Again, I mean, I I I I never a little, but I I was based in Montenegro for a year, so I had a bit of a sense of Albania across the border, but still very, very traditional cultural practices in villages. And No. Now just just on the you you mentioned Germany there. We had lunch with somebody today who's telling us that they're they're really having a bit of a problem in terms of nurse recruitment at the moment because the German government We're having a big nursing drive, and we're able to offer kind of 4 times the salary for a nurse to go to work in in Germany rather than Albania. So that that that is That's a big issue. I don't know whether this is true in Albania, but I at recent trips to Romania, for example, I've been through villages where there are basically Technically, no men to be seen. All the young men are working in Germany, and there are women working in the field. So it's it's, it's very, very interesting, the demographic impacts that kind of huge draw of Northern Europe right the way down through May 9, 2021. On the boats. I mean, I don't know this, and I've I've not seen the data, but I do wonder whether Part of the increased appeal at the moment, that is driving seems to be driving the numbers up is the the the knowledge of post Brexit labor shortages, and that there's there's a they know that there there is a massive labor market there if they can only get into it. 100%. Well, To be discussed in the next PodPass, but kudos to you, and and we, I thought that was really interesting. And I'm I now need to deliver, another world leader for you who is as interesting and as open and as charming. Don't mean to worry, Roy, but I've got another one lined up who's just said yes. So there you go. It's precious on that. And and he's left wing as well, so you gotta get but he did like your he did like William Hague, so that's good. So do make sure William Hague listens to it. I definitely will. Alright. Lots of love, Anastar. Bye bye. Thank you. All the best. Take care.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to The Rest is Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Mister Campbell, alongside our 1st serving prime minister guest on the rest of his politics. We've had a former prime minister, Tony Blair. We've had a hopefully future prime minister, Keir Starmer. We've had a former future prime minister, William Hague, and now we have you. And one of the reasons we have you is that I'm well aware that you're a regular listener to the rest of his politics, And you particularly enjoyed the interview with William Hague, which is the one interview which Rory Stewart has managed to secure so far.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think it was the The best episode of this of the series, because It's not at all, something you can get often nowadays. So gracious, so insightful, And, so humble, man coming from so long Live in politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: But so what did you see as his insights?\n\nSpeaker 2: It was very insightful about The state of affairs nowadays, it was very insightful about Russia, about China, also very interesting. It's very insightful, about the, the inner struggles of someone who is in politics and who has this, permanent, challenge to be in or to get out and when is the time to get out and How much you can stay in and so on and so further. So, if I if I would say it all, I would say although he didn't beat Tony Blair, in the life after politics, he seemed happier than Tony Blair.\n\nSpeaker 1: So let's let's let's follow-up with this prime minister. So you you I mean, you you're an extraordinary example of this. You're unusual, very unusual as a politician. You were a very leading, artist, Serious professional artist, and a serious international basketball player as well as sportsman before you became, a politician. How how do you think about politics?\n\nHow do you know when you've been in long enough? How do you know when your Mind is beginning to become adversely affected. What do you think are the the strains of being a politician?\n\nSpeaker 2: First of all, I have to To set the record straight, I was not a serious international basketball player. I was, I was a mediocre national basketball player. And The reason why I played basketball, first of all, was my asthma, because, my parents thought that It was, it was good for me to play basketball to fight my asthma, which is which was true. Secondly, the reason why I was taken and Make all the way to the national team was because I was particularly tall in that time, particularly short Albania. And, thirdly, yes, I tried to be up to the task, but I would not So at all, except that I was an internationally series basketball player.\n\nPlayed few international games, from the bench From the bench, but, at the end, it was a fantastic experience of understanding Team ship, understanding leadership, understanding solidarity, and, and also conflict done so many things that sports gives to you. While me being here today as prime minister interviewed by Alastair Campbell is another miracle of life because, I would not have been in politics if Alastair Campbell would not exist. And if, Tony Blair would not exist, and if Third Way would not exist, and if new labor would not exist. So, the Time I saw myself, I had a mirage of myself being in in Somewhere in politics was when I was in Paris, buying a newspaper, the aftermath of the victory of the new labor. And then things happened in a way that, I was I was back in Tirana to bury my father, Leaving as an artist in Paris, it was the same day that there was a reshuffle of government.\n\nSo, what could not happen anywhere else And can happen always in the Balkans is that you go to bury your father and become minister of culture. And then, the rest is known.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, so a little bit on that then. So your father was a sculptor in what seems to be a sort of socialist realist Style. He studied in Moscow. He came back to Albania, and he did kind of big socialist heroic sculpture sculptures.\n\nIs that right? Very much a product of the Albanero of the time.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. My father was one of the most, prominent official Sculptures of the regime. Yeah. He was part of this group of sculptures that basically Made the most important monuments, professionally, absolutely, respectful, but, So ideologically and also in terms of, the methods, absolutely something that I was fully against. So with my father, we had a very strong but also very intense relation in the sense that, I didn't like anything, he he did, and he didn't really want me to do anything I I did because, he he was more afraid of, me ending up badly.\n\nBut, I value very much this relation because he was a liberal he was a liberal person. He never tried to impose, me doing anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Just following up on this a little bit. Was he somebody who you think was genuinely passionately committed to the idea of international communism? Did he genuinely believe in Albania's policies in the seventies in relation to China, or was he more pragmatic? He understood where power lay.\n\nHe wanted to make his art, and so he compromised. I mean, when you interacted with him as a young person at the dinner table, was there a lot of Ideological conversation?\n\nSpeaker 2: I believe that, there were many like him that, came from, poor Or let's say, not rich families and had the chance to get out, look the world, be be in Soviet Union have their studies, be inspired by this, you know, revolutionary flame Coming back to build, to build the paradise on Earth and then slowly understanding that they were participating in the building on of the hell on Earth. And so, I don't think that he was any more passionate when I could when I could have, let's say conversations that I could analyze in a certain age, but I think, it was a very it was a very strong combination between inertia and, an amount of fear, An amount of, practicality because at the end, you know, we were totally isolated from west, from east. We were North Korea of Europe. So, many many of them, people that, when they were younger, embrace communism as As an inspiration, as an ideal, turned to be, practically, people that were, you know, that gave up In their own silence. So but on the other hand, this this was part of me being involved in the anti Communist movement in the arts academy and which was practically the seeds of what then became my political per year.\n\nSpeaker 0: But, like, you didn't really answer Rory's question about whether you think politics has has changed you or whether because Rory talks a lot on the podcast about how he felt that his political Korea almost dehumanized him. It dehumanizes a lot of people in in politics as to whether you think it's changed you fundamentally and also whether you Know when you'll be ready to to leave and move on. You've now won 3 elections, which is pretty rare in the modern age.\n\nSpeaker 2: Maybe may I don't think Rory got in this conclusion while he was still in politics. I think after leaving politics, he started to realize that he was somehow handicapped And started to see that something was missing, here. Something was missing there for from the pieces he know he had Before entering politics. I don't know. I have to make this checkup when I get out.\n\nBut, I think that, in one way, doing art in the same time, helps me, to keep some balance, to keep some sanity. And, in the same time, yes, politics makes you more and more, keen to forget about sentiments and, more and more, taken by results, results, results. And, of course, there is something something, a kind of, a kind of, for barbarization of your soul.\n\nSpeaker 0: I should say, Roy, Eddie doodles endlessly while he's in meetings, and his wallpaper is just a collection of his of his of his best doodles.\n\nSpeaker 1: But but you're quite, he's quite but you're quite quite a serious painter. I I mean, I I've been looking at some of your work. Are you Are you you're still doing serious painting or or less than when you were in Paris?\n\nSpeaker 2: Listen. The most serious part of my paintings, in my art It's the part that I didn't do it seriously, which, is the part that I did, while I was engaged in politics as business of culture, Sitting in the government meetings, I have never entered a government building until becoming minister of culture. As an artist, I never Wanted to enter a government building or an office or whatever. Never had an office life. And so I couldn't stand the long hours of the council of minister, So I was doodling and doodling and doodling and doodling, and my, colleague, minister of education was near me, telling me after every session, can I take it?\n\nCan I take it? And he took and took and took. And one day, I go to visit him and I, for some other reason. And, at the end, he says to me, do you want to see my art collection? I said, we have an art collection.\n\nAnd he has a whole portfolio with my doodles. And when I see them all together, I realized that there was something there. And I go back, at To my office, very sad, very, very down. The guy was under some charges at the time, and I said to my assistant, I am Afraid that I will prove that he is a thief. He has stolen all my art.\n\nAnd, she said, no. You have much more. And she opened her Her shelf, it was full of doodles. I was doing all the time in office without even even and then, she conspired with a friend from the academy, Former friend in the arts academy, they brought some doodles, in a exhibition, and then, this started to get to get out, and then a German gallerist came to me to see me because he saw the book I did.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just for our listeners, just so that they can understand what you're talking about. So when you say doodle, people imagine it's like They take their biro pen, and they draw a little smiley face in the bottom of their meeting agenda. But your doodles are completely different. Your doodles are, For example, a Google diary sheet, and you will have written some numbers across it, but then over the top is the most extraordinarily complex Pieces of art, incredible numbers of different colors. I mean, there are I see vegetable forms, birds.\n\nSpeaker 2: Because it's part of hours and hours in office, meetings and meetings. And, while I am focused On the on talking with the people that are in front of me or are in the phone, my hand and my eyes continue to do their job to somehow, Keep Me Balance. And, that's why they are and and their sophistication depends a lot from the length of the time spent In office or for the length of the meeting. So,\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm also very very proud to be I am on this wallpaper on a horse with a mobile phone in one hand and a sword in the other.\n\nSpeaker 2: It was, the this this, this drawing of Alastair in my wallpaper was premonitory of, of the incursion, the crusade would make against Boris Johnson, you know, because, his iPhone, and his, sword and his horse\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Is known. So I I have a wonderful Friend who's a great political supporter who sent me there's a a Rembrandt picture that that maybe you know of a a young man in a sort of Polish Cossack horse costume Riding on a on a horse through a legendary landscape with a crumbling castle on the background, and he sent this to me also to try to inspire me to ride against Boris Johnson. So maybe there's a There's a cavalry theme coming through.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I don't and so, Eddie, you've raised Boris Johnson, not me. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. I simply don't.\n\nSpeaker 0: You raised Boris Johnson. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: So just tell me when I every time because this This this this is Alistair in on the horse with his sword and his iPhone is in in front of my eyes many times. And, every time I used to see it, I used To just pity Boris, to have, behind him someone so obsessed to kill him as soon as possible.\n\nSpeaker 0: So your assessment now of let's just go through a couple of current things and then come on to your assessment of where we are as a country and where you are as a country. So first of all, you've had this extraordinary situation with Iran, cyber attack Yeah. That you've had to respond to pretty vigorously. We've also got the issue of the spike in Albanians crossing the channel in small boats, which has become a problem for both your government and ours. And then I think also just briefly on what your assessment of Britain in the world is now.\n\nWe've had we've had this British week in Albania, lots of good cooperation, but I'd be interested in your take post Brexit. And finally, your assessment of Albania's place in the world, which, you know, you have massive progress, but you've also got big challenges you're still facing. So take us through all of that.\n\nSpeaker 2: So the Iran thing has to do with a heavy cyber attack, on us, that we worked very, very thoroughly to Understand who was behind it, and the attribution is not based on, assessments that come from, you know, speculation, but is based on a forensic, on proofs and on the hard work of some Super special teams that we had with us from Microsoft, from, US, even UK Experts, had to look in it. So we had 100% proof that the Public, Islamic Republic of Iran was behind it, so we had to retaliate with the severance of our diplomatic ties.\n\nSpeaker 0: And why would they do it?\n\nSpeaker 2: We think because we we have sheltered here, some thousands of For refugees that are not, amicable to their regime to say the least. And we did it, In a fully humanitarian basis, they were in camp liberty in Iraq. They were massacred and raided every 2 weeks, every 3 weeks by the Iranian service, and kids and women were killed. So, we accepted to shelter them. Albania has always been, you know, keen to to give shelter to people, to People in trouble, we have done it during 2nd World War.\n\nAlbania was the only country to have more Jews after the war than before. And with a clean record of no one Jew, delivered to the Nazis by by an Albanian, family or citizen, then we we we sheltered, half a 1000000, Kosovars, you know, because you were part of that, that, epic epic moment. And then, the Afghans. The Afghans that were, were left Behind, in that mass of Kabul, Kabul airport and the Getting out of the NATO forces without really having had a plan, what we'll do for them who Who worked for us there, who stood for us, who believed in us. And I I I found this was not good not right.\n\nYou know? So We opened the doors for some thousands of Afghans. And, so it's in our it's in our DNA, let's say. And we don't regret it, and we'll Do it again and again and again because, you know, in the same time, we have been once in need to be sheltered from others. So we left Albania, not from, from Islamic or a Taliban, religious regime, but from an atheist regime.\n\nWe were 1,000 with the boats going to Italy to ask for Help for food, for shelter. And, we are here today, in this A new stage of our history because someone helped us before. So\n\nSpeaker 0: In small boats?\n\nSpeaker 2: Small boats, is a is a sad story, frankly. Although it's an unclear story because there are numbers we see in the British media that do not really match with the numbers we see, in our own sites or this increase, there was a very interesting article in The Guardian that, was So somehow questioning these numbers. But beyond that, we need to know from where these People coming. They are Albanians. Yes.\n\nBut they're Albanians from Albania. Albanians from Kosovo. They're Albanians from other Albanian areas. They are coming From Albania or they are coming from France or they're coming from, Greece or from Italy. We had the same situation with France some some time ago.\n\nWe had the same situation with Germany some time ago. And when Germany declared the Safe origin and, simply didn't accept anymore to put the people in an asylum seeking procedure by giving them funds, social Assistance, house, and so on. They moved to France, and now they are moving towards England. So, it's very important to to understand, but this being said, we we we we are cooperating with the British authorities. We are setting some operations to take all to take all the the the traffickers because the the the terrible part of it is that So this goes this is a very lucrative business for traffickers.\n\nAnd But\n\nSpeaker 0: do do you have any understanding why it is suddenly just these numbers have gone up in the way that they have?\n\nSpeaker 2: You never, you there's always it's always like a like a rumor coming out, and then some are going, and then some relatives there are calling. And then, the no the the noise is that, in Britain, you have now some opportunity because there is a there is a vacuum created there. We can feel it. So it's, it's it's how it works.\n\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to to sort of shift around for a moment and talk a little bit about perceptions of Albania and the way prime minister that you're Perceived internationally and in Britain. So you reprimanded me because I think you heard me talk on the podcast. In an earlier session, I was referring The corruption in Albania and organized crime in Albania and all this kind of thing. So you then got in touch, I think, through Alastair, to say that I was providing a very negative, portrait of the country. But I wanted to see your reflections on this in some some way because, obviously, we read media.\n\nWe go online. We read about Albania, and Certainly, even as a even as a minister, I'm afraid, you know, when we were dealing with the home office and the prison system, Albania did not have a very strong reputation on these things. So It would be interesting to know a little bit about what is correct, what is incorrect, and help us navigate ourselves a bit.\n\nSpeaker 2: First of Paul, you should have known already after so many, episodes that when I listen to pass a message message, there is always a spin. I I I didn't, I didn't blame you, And I never deny that we have, problems with corruption, and we have, also problems with crime, because we are not yet in a stage of a modern country that provides for the citizens, all the service and all the All the standards that make corruption unnecessary because corruption at the end, when, it comes to To developing countries is an alternative of, the state. It's a it's a service that is given in a not legal way, because the state is, somehow being late or being, lazy or being unable to give the this service\n\nSpeaker 1: Prime minister, can I can I interrupt for a second? Sorry. The this is a historical question, but was this, was organized crime and corruption a big issue Under communism before 89, or is it something that largely occurred because of the breakdown of that system in 89?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. During communism, we never heard about So the word corruption, word corruption came with a new vocabulary. In my in my in my memory, I don't recall to have heard the word corruption. Crime, yes. There were some, you know, petite crime, but organized crime, no.\n\nBecause Organized crime by definition is, is, transnational. So, It has to do with trafficking. It has to do with smuggling. It has to do with, a lot of activities that imply borders, imply interactions. So we didn't have that.\n\nBut we didn't have many other things during communism. For example, Albania was, I think the country with the lowest heart attacks in the world because Lowest\n\nSpeaker 1: heart attacks?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. Because our cholesterol was, 0 because we didn't have too much to eat, and we were on vegetables, No meat, no alcohol, no nothing. So, we were a country with no heart attacks. So heart attacks and cholesterol came with democracy.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is this is the Britain of the future, Roy. It's another\n\nSpeaker 2: 12 years of the tourism industry. And organized crime came with democracy. So these are Part of this part. This being said, I think we have done incredible, incredible work, and we have we have achieved incredible results, in fighting exactly this type of corrupt because corruption, in in in a in a in a scale of of undermining the the law for bigger for big profit is everywhere. The problem with developing countries, which Which you don't find in developed countries is that corruption touches everyone.\n\nSo it touches you as a citizen when you Want the service touches you as a as a father or or a parent when you want your kid to go to the school he or she deserves, touches you as a Young guy getting out of university when he want to have a job. So corruption interferes everywhere. And I think we have beaten corruption in many ways, in that level. The cyber attack was very, very, heavy heavily damaging Because it shut down the digital services. We have today 95% of the services That until yesterday were given in long lines implying a lot of, bribery in, in the in the cloud, so in digital.\n\nSo you you don't see anyone. You don't need to talk to anyone in your iPhone. You ask for a license. You ask for permission. You ask for Your medical status, you ask for more than a 1000 things, and, you get them online.\n\nSo the this means that all this part of corruption is gone for the people.\n\nSpeaker 0: But how far where you were when you came in 3 elections ago or where you need to be in these and other issues, for example, to be considered seriously for entry in the European Union. How far along that road do you think you are?\n\nSpeaker 2: If we see, Albania today with the eyes of from where we started, it's like day and night. If we see Albania tomorrow from the ice where we are, it's night and day. So we need to make, a lot A lot yet, and to it's a long way.\n\nSpeaker 0: And how you had a very, very good relationship with Angela Merkel. Has that continued with Schultz? Do you still feel the Germans are very, very supportive?\n\nSpeaker 2: I have to tell you one thing that is, is not a joke. It's a real thing. When I met Schultz, in Angela's office, and, I sat in front of him for some minutes. I was, in a very strange state of mind because I was thinking it was she presenting herself as a man in front of me. Really?\n\nSame same same same posture, Same place of the hands, same way of looking, same way of reacting, Same same pace of the voice. The moment I realized it was not, it's not it was not her, but it was not was him, was when he said, I'm I'm very committed to bring, Albania and the Western Balkans in the EU during my mandate. She would never said that.\n\nSpeaker 0: But she was doing it?\n\nSpeaker 2: No. But, because it needs time. You know? It it needs a lot of time. And then I said, okay.\n\nAbout how many Mondays you you you you you are gonna win to do that? No. I mean, he's a lot of continuity. I think it's totally unfair to criticize him based on the comparison with Angela when she left. And I believe if people try to remember Angela in her 1st months in office, I'm sure she She and would be again the same.\n\nSo, she was not the Angela we know now. She was much more Fragile, much more secure, much more you know? So, I think he he has, he has all to be to be Angela all the way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Premise, tell us about Angela at her peak. I mean, you're an admirer of her. What what is it you think made her do you think she's the greatest European politician of this decade?\n\nSpeaker 2: Ma'am, maybe in this decade, it's it's very easy to be the best in Europe. Competition not not very big. Yes. I think she Saved, the honor of Europe and the honor of our civilization, the moment she stood very strong In front of the huge wave of refugees, in 2015, this was amazing. Against all polls, against all public opinions, against all The fears and the unknown, she stood, and, this was an incredible, moment of, of Feeling the privilege to know her.\n\nAnd then I think, yes, she was, she was great, in a sense that she never, spoke, wishful thinking. She always prepared herself. She always stick to the facts. She always try to be truthful. She never and, you know, I think Angela Merkel, was someone you could not charm.\n\nShe You couldn't charm her? You couldn't charm. She was someone that didn't need, didn't feel the need to be charmed. You know? She was very gentle, very kind, but being uncharmable is the highest, level of the respect and of self awareness And the dignity, I think it's it's it's amazing.\n\nShe will she was not some someone you would charm.\n\nSpeaker 0: So the 4 points the 4 questions I laid out earlier, you dealt with 3 of them, but not Britain. So you mentioned there of those qualities you've just outlined for Angela Merkel, how many of them would apply to our recently departed prime minister?\n\nSpeaker 2: He wants me he wants to bring me the horse. You know? You know, this you you you you're talking about paintings. You know, there is another famous painting, you know, with this, with a death, with a young, lady in the horse. So Alistair now wants me to be the young lady that, with the innocent face of,\n\nSpeaker 0: talking about of of a\n\nSpeaker 2: poor Albanian, prime minister Sir, tell us how horrible Boris Johnson was, but I'm not gonna get in your trap.\n\nSpeaker 0: No? Yeah. But but but the answer the answer is you wouldn't say any of those things about him that you said about Aguilar. Otherwise, you'd have said them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tell us about recent French leaders compared to recent German leaders. How do you think they rate compared to German leaders in in their conduct in the last decade?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think I think, Emmanuel Macron has another problem. People, especially in France, They really don't know who he really is, and, it's a pity that he cannot transmit When, he's in public, how how interesting he is, how human he is, how How much respectful he is of, of, people. How how curious he is to listen. It's it's really incredible, you know, to have the President of France, write text you out of the blue and say, how you see things? Tell me.\n\nWhat do you think? Like this. So it means that he's, someone, absolutely, a lot maybe not absolute, but a lot different from what the French thing that he's an arrogant Boy that doesn't really feel, people. He doesn't really, care about anything else than the rich. It's not true at all.\n\nYou know? He's someone with a vision, with ambition, you know, but I don't know what's what's missing that, doesn't make the right connection with people.\n\nSpeaker 0: You you as you you mentioned, the Tony Blair's government's role in relation to Kosovo. And we've talked before, and I've been always very interested by your assessment of Kosovo in terms of where the Balkans was then and where it is now, but also your view that\n\nSpeaker 2: Putin repeats, repeats the word Kosovo many times. Especially, since the war started, he speaks, about Kosovo many times because, in his mind, his idea of the Of the international law, Kosovo is, the mirror where every 1 who participated in its liberation should see his own hypocrisy While talking about Crimea, in his mind, Kosovo, is the biggest Example of how the western world's, America and its allies broke Brutally international law. And, Crimea in his mind is the the detector of this big hypocrisy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and more than Iraq, you feel, in his mind?\n\nSpeaker 2: For Iraq, he has, he has, of course, The convention that was in breach of international law. But, when it comes to Kosovo, it's much it's much more it's much more, to him, a twin case of, Crimea. So a land that was taken from one state In the name of the people living there while, Crimea is the land, taken back to, the state where it belongs in the name of people living there. So,\n\nSpeaker 1: And and and, probably, so just on that one, for our listeners, particularly American, British listeners, The situation in the Western Balkans is something that people talk about, but there's very, very little covered. Is it something that people should be anxious about? Is it people that that Policymakers in Washington and London should be focused more on.\n\nSpeaker 2: In this in this moment, I'm less I'm less preoccupied. I was very preoccupied in the beginning because Western Balkans. First of all, I think, that European Union is the only Geographical reality in the history of the maps with 1 outside border and 1 inside border. And within this Inside border is the Western Balkans. So you cannot enter the Western Balkans without entering EU.\n\nAnd you have to Enter you and to get out of EU to be in the Western Balkans. And you cannot get out of Western Balkans Without reentering EU. So it's like, it's like having a stomach within your body, but But, somehow, somehow, circumscribed it with the border.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and prime minister, sorry. And, professor, I'm being going to be just interrupt for a second for our listeners just to remind them that we're talking here about some of the tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now within this this, borders, we within EU, Russia has its most So, it's most, obvious influence from Republic of Serbia in Bosnia to Serbia itself To, Montenegro partly and to North Macedonia. So, let's say in this, Slav orthodox world, there is a lot of Russian influence. And, to give you an example, in Albania, Vladimir Putin popularity is 0.7%. So So 0.67% of Albanians think that Putin is right. 99.3% think that Putin is wrong.\n\nWhile in Serbia, 80% of Serbs think that Putin is a hero showing his bolts to the west. And, I was predefined because put of course, put in try to use its influence to disrupt here in the Western Balkans. And this could happen in a certain way easy if the west would push Serbia beyond a certain limit to sanction Russia. Serbia cannot sanction Russia because physically is impossible. They cannot leave a day without the Russian gas.\n\nSecondly, because of public opinion. So, asking from Serbia too much, too fast Would could have been disastrous for the Western Balkan because this this would disrupt a process we have started in In the Western Balkan of collaboration, building peace, open Balkan initiative, and all this. Serbia, made a long way on the other side because, it was a huge surprise. They voted 3 times against Russia and the United Nations, even Yes. To expel Russia from the human rights committee.\n\nSo as far as this sanction thing will not be, will not be So pressuring to break it, I'm not much better by it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Are you happy about being within the context, again, of getting to the European Union, that you and Serbia, in a sense, have to develop in different ways, but at the same time. And is your relationship with Serbia good?\n\nSpeaker 2: It's not a matter of being happy. It's a matter of, finally having understood that, you don't pick your neighbors and your neighbors are there to stay. So, the choice is very, very clear. Or you look for trouble and troubles will hit you and will make Your life more difficult or you look for peace and cooperation? So, working in this second direction, We can see much more benefits for the future, and we can build the peace we need.\n\nWhile the first direction has, taught us for 100 of years that the end is, is is cruelly unjust for for the next generations.\n\nSpeaker 1: We talked about Russia in in the Western Balkans, New York. But, of course, people will also talk about China and Hungary, and I'd be very interested to see whether there is, You know, often, if you were reading an article in New York Times, if you talked about Western Balkans, you would put Russia, China, and Hungary together as potentially anti western forces operating the Western Balkans.\n\nSpeaker 2: Listen. Because of our history, in Albania, we have a very particular situation. In our history, We, had Stalin here standing in the main square until 1990. So, our our, guys thought that Khrushchev was too soft or that the Soviet Union, Empire was a bunch of traitors that they, abandoned Stalin. And with that, they gave up the cause.\n\nSo they left The Soviet Bloc, they left the Warsaw Treaty, and they went to China. And they went to China and China, and we got with Stalin Also the worst of China, the cultural revolution, of the sixties. So, this made Albania a place where no Russia and neither China are really, seen like, the saviors, like, what we desperately need. And, practically, we we are a country that is 100% renewables. We we are based, our our electricity is Fully based on hydro production, so we don't have Russian gas.\n\nWe don't have Russia here in any shape or form, only with an embassy That, has removed lately because we named the road of the embassy for Ukraine. And, their envelopes So we're coming, Russian embassy for Ukraine, Russian embassy for Ukraine. So now we have moved in another place, and I heard from the mayor that he wants to move the name to that place. Let's see what will what will happen. China is, is, He's also not very present in Albania.\n\nWe have a normal relation, but not that much. But beyond that, I have to bring the attention on one point. In Europe, they speak more and more about geopolitics. They speak more and more about western western Balagans. Speak more and more about Not letting what they call 3rd actors to fill the void.\n\nAnd guess what? There the pandemic comes. They are all, in their, in their moment of uncertainty. And, they gather and they distribute vaccines within the EU countries, and no one does comes to us. So we are, as I said, in the middle of Europe, and we are connected to the European life in all ways with people leaving Europe, with TVs from Europe.\n\nAnd we felt like, fish is out of water. And what what we did, we ran to Turkey, to China, and to Russia. And it was Turkey, that provided vaccine for Albanians. It was China that provided vaccines for Serbia And, other parts, it was Russia that provided some to some others. So, without these 3, these 3 heads, The devil, let's say, would not have survived.\n\nSo\n\nSpeaker 0: now The Europe the European Union, you you would argue made a mistake.\n\nSpeaker 2: European Union made a shameful mistake, And then they started to bring vaccines. Now and I said to them, when we were back in the council, don't do it again with the energy crisis. If you have a package to support the countries of European Union with extra money to mitigate the huge cost of the energy, Don't let the Balkans out because it will be another another example of, saying something and meaning something else and doing something Completely different.\n\nSpeaker 0: So you still desperately want to get into the European Union. What is your assessment of Britain's role in the world?\n\nSpeaker 2: Listen. We we we have, It's it's it's the first time in in our history that we have chosen with our free will where where we want to be. For centuries, we have been where we didn't choose and where we were not asked under different regimes, in a in a different places, but never where we belong, which is, let's say, the western civilization. And, in 1990, when the anti regime movement succeeded, the slogan was we want Albania like Europe. So being in Europe is for us to be in a safe place and to be in a place where people count, not where, others decide for you.\n\nSometimes, you know, it's embarrassing to to to be to to have to answer a question. Britain is leaving. You're entering. It feels a bit like, you know, divorcing and telling to young men in love, don't marry. It doesn't work.\n\nYou know? Everyone has to go through the marriage to realize that maybe it's not so so amazing. So divorcing has never stopped others to marry.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and some and some marriages work.\n\nSpeaker 2: There are even cases when second marriages Work. So maybe Britain will come back one day to remarry with Europe. It looks like impossible today, but, So maybe one day, they'll rethink of it because, you know, being alone, surrounded by water, it's not always so so So amusing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Prime minister, I had a a a I'm I've been fascinated by this visual image you've given us, which is It's this Northern Renaissance painting by Hans Baldung called the knight, death, and the maiden. And for the for the readers who are, listeners who are not haven't seen the painting, Essentially, it's a night on a horse But for the main time\n\nSpeaker 2: in a\n\nSpeaker 0: row, he's talked about our readers. Right? Rory, just podcast, listen. Books, read. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: I need to get this straight in my head. Okay. So we we have a picture. Early 16th century. We have a knight on a horse.\n\nWe have a maiden grabbing onto the night, and then we have death with his teeth grabbing onto the skirt of the maiden's the maiden's skirt. And you were you were expressing yourself as Seizing like the maiden onto Alastair Campbell the night as he rides away with death trying to chew onto your onto your skirt. I wondered what direction you you think you and Alastair can ride in the future. If not against Boris Johnson, what would be an exciting direction for the 2 of you to go on your horse?\n\nSpeaker 0: Are you doing a 4th term?\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. It's, it's, it's all to be seen. And, and the great thing with Alastair, Which, I think it's shown also by this podcast is that, he's very successful in things, that Even him does not expect before. So I'm sure that he'll find something else to to do when it comes To do something together, and, I'll be very pleased to to embark with him and his horse. But please not to To kill another conservative prime minister.\n\nThis, he can this is he can do with his own, not with me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, listen. Thank you for your time. Thank you. I didn't realize that that is what got you into politics. I've never heard you say that before, but that was the whole new labor thing, third way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. The the This was, the most this was the biggest inspiration. It was like a mirage. I didn't decide at that moment, but I, Tony Blair, I end with this, this, young, new politician Coming and breaking, breaking the old house with this completely new spirit and, this wave of change and this rock star, you know, type, of, of Communication and all this. And then I started to follow and follow and follow all the way.\n\nAnd, practically, The first thing I did when I became leader of the party, I I started the 3rd way the 3rd way thing and The 1 men, 1 vote process and many more. And I'm and and I'm happy to see, that third way still works For them who are not afraid of it and, especially for them who, are not in denial of it. It has been So big pain to see, the Labor Party, going in a very incomprehensible denial of, what the achievements were, for of of the new labor, and I hope now it's, it's a moment that we can recover.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you so much, prime minister. Thank you for your time. We really appreciate it.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Rory. Thank you, Alastair. It was an honor to be to be in this\n\nSpeaker 0: Wonderful. Country's chart topping podcast.\n\nSpeaker 2: It is wonderful version of the House of Commons. If the House of Commons was like your podcast, I'm sure People be enchanted again of politics. Maybe.\n\nSpeaker 0: Would you like to say a final word to the supporters of Burnley Football Club, your English team?\n\nSpeaker 2: Burnley Football Club. I I was so I was so shocked when Alistair, we are do said to me yesterday, we are doing well. We are 4th or 5th in the championship, I said I said how how the bar can be so low. I I I don't understand, but\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Without that biggest cuts, we don't ever insult Burnley Football Club on this podcast. Thank you for your time. So, Marie, what do you think of that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, firstly, thank you. I mean, I thought that was really, really fun To to meet the prime minister of Albania, get a sense of his history and stuff. I I guess it's a bit tricky, isn't it, interviewing somebody from a completely different country because I'll be very aware that opposition politicians in Albania will be very disappointed that we were not tougher Mhmm. And harder. And I'm vaguely aware in the back of my mind that there are still massive issues around organized crime and corruption, and I don't know how to push that.\n\nAnd we're trying to get the balance right between being polite and respectful, and I don't really know enough. I mean, I did think, though, he is a great, great charmer. I thought he he's incredibly articulate. He's got a lovely manner. He's very learned, and I can see why you like him so much.\n\nSpeaker 0: Look. We could have sort of run him ragged over Albania dominating the cocaine market in the UK and whether they've been tough enough in the past, and we could have done that. But the The thing is I also know because I also don't forget I've seen him being interviewed a lot. He's he's and he has followed the Tony Blair rule book in many, many ways. And one of them, he's very good at doing interviews where he's where people are trying to put him on the defensive.\n\nAnd I just think that if you've got time to I think for our listeners, you won't know many of whom won't know that Hutch about Albania. Although we do apparently have 22,200 moderately regular listeners to the podcast in Albania, aren't you, Tayroy? But I think that they'll be interested in you know, I I when I was talking to somebody the other day and said, you know, I've I've been to come into Albania on for over a decade ever since before he became prime minister and and literally said, I don't know any he said, I don't know anything about Albania. And, like, you know, when it so when you say things like, you know, Enver Hochsia or you know? Then when you mentioned Dua Lipa and Rita Ora, and you say there's a kind of Albanian connection, and then suddenly their their sort of vague interest is.\n\nSo I think what he was talking, putting it in that context of geopolitics as well, that's what that's what I like talking to you about. I think he's got a very good geopolitical And, and, also, he is. He's you know, he said the point right at the end about about how sad he has found it to see the Labour Party, particularly under You know, after Gordon went, that Ed Miliband and then particularly under Jeremy Corbyn, to see it sort of move away from the political values and source of policies that inspired him to go into politics. And, you know, we have done 3 campaigns together now, and we've we've used a lot of the new labor principles, and he's, You know, he's won all 3.\n\nSpeaker 1: To to get it done. Yeah. I mean, I've also I'm fascinated, but it's so difficult, isn't it, with serving politicians to get Honest answers to problems. So one of the things I'd be interested in, I'm very interested in countries with a lot of corruption, organized crime, is How dangerous is it to be a prime minister or a minister? I mean, how much freedom have you got to are you actually in a situation where if you really alienate these people, Will they come along and kill you?\n\nI mean, I remember talking to a Jamaican politician who was leaving Jamaican politics because he quite literally said he was gonna be murdered if he continued.\n\nSpeaker 0: I had dinner with Eddie in a restaurant, last night, and almost the the number of police cars and security that were around the place seems to have gone up since when he took office. I don't know what that's about. But, yeah, I I think that you you you I guess that is does have to be sort of part of it, but I I I I do think that that He understands the importance of Albania's image in the world, and I think has made efforts to to tackle that. And, you know, we're I'm with Dom, the producer of the podcast who's been with us last couple of days, first time in Tirana, and I think he's been absolutely gobsmacked by what Tirana like and feels like and how vibrant and buzzy and clean and and all the rest of it. He's nodding.\n\nSpeaker 1: My friend Emma's just been on holiday. He just thinks it's absolutely Beautiful. And they're they're I mean, he's doing very, very well on the PR. I mean, if you my favorite journal, The New York Times, if you Go through their stuff in Albania. There's lots of stuff about, you know, a largely unexplored corner of Europe with 265 miles of coastline, High end waterside resorts and lovely stuff about how Tirana's becoming a creative haven for artists.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, tourism's going really well in in Toronto. And, listen, I recommend Albania for holidays to regularly to people, particularly young people who are maybe looking for you know, not to get broke on the back of a good holiday. And, honestly, they I've yet to have anyone come back other than absolutely totally impressed. And I've been here dozens of times now, and I always enjoy it. And I don't think he hides the problems, but I do think this is the divorce.\n\nYou got a problem. You know? Clearly, this is what we're referring to in the boats, is that there are still young people who want to leave, and, that that is because some of these economic and social challenges.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's still a a very, very poor country comparatively, I mean, if you compare it to a country like Germany. And Yeah. Again, I mean, I I I I never a little, but I I was based in Montenegro for a year, so I had a bit of a sense of Albania across the border, but still very, very traditional cultural practices in villages. And\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Now just just on the you you mentioned Germany there. We had lunch with somebody today who's telling us that they're they're really having a bit of a problem in terms of nurse recruitment at the moment because the German government We're having a big nursing drive, and we're able to offer kind of 4 times the salary for a nurse to go to work in in Germany rather than Albania. So that that that is That's a big issue.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't\n\nSpeaker 1: know whether this is true in Albania, but I at recent trips to Romania, for example, I've been through villages where there are basically Technically, no men to be seen. All the young men are working in Germany, and there are women working in the field. So it's it's, it's very, very interesting, the demographic impacts that kind of huge draw of Northern Europe right the way down through\n\nSpeaker 0: May 9, 2021. On the boats. I mean, I don't know this, and I've I've not seen the data, but I do wonder whether Part of the increased appeal at the moment, that is driving seems to be driving the numbers up is the the the knowledge of post Brexit labor shortages, and that there's there's a they know that there there is a massive labor market there if they can only get into it.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100%. Well, To be discussed in the next PodPass, but kudos to you, and and we, I thought that was really interesting. And I'm I now need to deliver, another world leader for you who is as interesting and as open and as charming.\n\nSpeaker 0: Don't mean to worry, Roy, but I've got another one lined up who's just said yes. So there you go. It's precious on that. And and he's left wing as well, so you gotta get but he did like your he did like William Hague, so that's good. So do make sure William Hague listens to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I definitely will. Alright. Lots of love, Anastar. Bye bye. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best. Take care.",
