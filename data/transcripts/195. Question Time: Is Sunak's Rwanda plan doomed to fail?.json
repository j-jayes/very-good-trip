Revolutionary technology real world results. That's Sap business Ai. Welcome to the rest politics question time with me asked Campbell and with me Rory Stewart. The rule kick off with something that we're both quite fascinated by, but you're sort of mildly obsessed with that's open Ai, Sam Alt. Red redacted. Good name prayer. Listener. Following open Ais tumultuous weekend, is raised concerns about the stability and alignment of artificial general intelligence with human values. In light of this, what measures can governments take to sure that the development and implementation of Ag not only aligns with, but also enhances human welfare. And global. I mean, what the hell is going on? Well, so that... That... That's the first thing. Nobody knows. It's it's really amazing. The New york Times has written 5 articles has thrown every journalist they've got in that suddenly their tech pages at it. And they've basically managed to find out nothing. Sam and won't comment. The chair won't comment. Just take it back for a bit for for listeners. I think most people understand. But open Ai is the absolute center of the artificial intelligence revolution. That's the company that produced chat Gb 3 and chat Gb 4. And Sam Alt was the Ceo of Open. He created this thing and is therefore 1 of the most significant tech entrepreneurs businessman in the world. And the end of last week, he was without any warning fired by his board. Yeah. Which didn't include the chairman of the board who also walked out in protest So the Ceo gone. Chairman of the board has gone, and they didn't bother it seems to tell Microsoft that it just invested 13000000000 dollars in open, which is has 13000 million dollars. But didn't bother to inform them. They... So Microsoft now hired him. So Microsoft has now Sat Na, who's the head of Microsoft has now hired him in to run a an independent research and institute form. The phrase that keeps being repeated by Open ai is that he's been fired for lack of transparency in interactions with the board affect undermining their decision. So the idea is that he was getting on with a agenda is the Ceo that the board didn't endorse. But it's an unbelievable decision. And the story that people seem to be Circling around whether it's sure or not is that Il Who is 1 of the other founders and he's on the board. Is worried that he wasn't taking seriously enough the ethical risks around Ai that Someone was beginning to lean more and more heavily into the commercial opportunities. And this of course has been a criticism of Elon Musk who we've talked about in the last podcast Must helped to get open Off the ground when it was a charity and has been in a boiling rage ever since now that it's gone partly commercial with the money coming in from Microsoft. And, of course, is also on the side of the fact that Ai is a potential risk. So a lot of this is is caught up. It seems although we can't get to the bottom it yet. In a frantic disagreement within the community about whether there are moral risks of it. Il Su has put out a short statement. I deeply regret my participation in the Board's actions. I never intended to harm open Ai I love everything we built together and we'll do everything I can to reunite the company. And obviously, this guy, Alt, who I've never met as is clearly very, very popular. There was a sort of massive walk out. And this is something that we talked about with Must Solomon and Reid hoffman. And essentially there's this argument between people who think that the whole thing is going to be catastrophe and who really, really worried that what they're actually doing with the stuff that they're creating. And those who feel that they're more realist, which is that this is new technology, but it doesn't pose massive extension threats. And that's where Alt was. But it does seem extraordinary that they can despite them being massive, incredibly powerful wealthy companies, still sort of really behaving like startups, they're behaving like startups ups and there's also a sense of how tiny this world is. I mean, absolutely tiny this world. I mean a lot of the people we've been interfering. Are on the boards of various these companies, or of the major investors and various these companies. These are all their friends. So. It's it's got much more of a feeling of what I I guess of what it felt like, with you when you were coming into office to 97 of a very close group of people who've known each other. For 15, 20 years who basically, many of them were at stanford for together, Sam Alt ran, the big venture capital firm the most famous sort of tech starter investing firm in California before he he went on to launch Open Ai. Mh Many of these people that we talked about were at Paypal so Elon Greed Hoffman all these people Peter T or knew each when they were setting up Paypal. So no, it's it's a tiny world. I think the other thing just just quickly. I was having dinner with some very, very interesting international Ceos. So heads a big international companies. American, Swedish, Spanish, etcetera. And how quickly Ai is changing the way they think. They were saying that nothing in 40 years of business they ever seen. Is having an impact as quickly as Ai is it's changing the way they think about tools? It's changing the way they think about whole functions in their company or do we even need to have a a call center anymore. Do we even need software engineers, and it's also beginning to generate completely different ideas about what a business model can be? And in fact, I think if you were labor coming in to run the British economy, the great hope would be that Ai might actually lead to a real productivity revolution. And that that might be the thing that would get growth off the ground again. I think this is something Tony Blair has been trying to say isn't no. Absolutely. But that's why I think we were both quite pleased that K style gave Peter Kyle, this job that is sort of technology and innovation, which is clearly you know, right this this is right at the heart of it. So I think a government that really did have a strategy for that would, you know, it could be it could be the future growth. We don't know. Yeah. I think, I mean, it could be amazing. I mean, the the the problem is of cause people are very skeptical because this is great cliche from an economist. Who said we see computers everywhere except in the economic statistics that technology was supposed to 30, 40 years ago, bring these incredible productivity gains. Mh. That it never quite seem to bring 1 of the the jokes is that you get ever better versions of powerpoint, but instead of improving your productivity do you just make ever fancier here, powerpoint decks. So the question Question is is Ai finally going to produce what you want, which is getting more out of the same number of people. Yeah. Yeah. Now your turn. Alright. Here's a here's a question for you. Paragraph films. Why do news reporters scream the most ridiculous and unprofessional comments and questions. Are politicians going in and out of buildings? And is there any strategy of answering these without becoming a story? Should the news be able to use these clips? It really grinds my gears. Can give us an example of some of these questions that they show? What what's kinda? Are you going to resign home secretary? You're right Exactly. And then the more the home secretary it avoids the question the more the question comes. Are you gonna resign home secretary? Or and some sometimes the questions like, are you a liar? I tell well that there was a guy who suddenly suddenly died recently but he's his nickname was Go. And he was the Bbc doorstep guy and he used to stand outside Danny Street and literally to shout those questions. But every now and again somebody answers is the truth. Right Or they react in a way that kind of make... They do something interesting. But what would be your advice to a cabinet minister walking out of Downing Street facing Go. Oh 0, sort of smile to move on. But if you think about it, that woman that Johnson made a dame Andrea Jenkins. Yeah. I mean the only thing that she's really known for is basically giving the middle finger. To a bunch of photographers. I bet you that was in response to a charity question. Right. So said you use is a great photograph. Yeah. Exactly. So you might get a reaction. Most of the time is a completely way complete waste of time. I mean, when... The only time that I've really had intense sort of personal media scrutiny it was in the build to the the iraq inquiry. And we had them outside the house the whole time. And I just decided day 1, I'm not going to say a single word. At any point outside write house, B. And I'm not going to look at them, react at them nothing... And was it not a bit weird? Because presumably, you knew them all, Some of these people looking standing out shout you. Yeah. And how does it feel to suddenly find that your friends are now turned into a sort of obeying crowd of luna on your front door. The really friendly ones probably wouldn't be banging. Right. They'd they'd be there. But you just have to go into a mindset that says they're not here. It's funny. When not when when actually went to the Iraq inquiry itself. I think Might have told you this before. There was dozens and dozens of media and there were protesters. And the police said to me, the the security people said to me, John go in the back and they said, no, there's no way I'm going in the back. So I walked through and I was so in the zone that I I wasn't even aware that things were being thrown at I was just I just decided I'm gonna walk from a to b, I'm gonna get to that door. I'm gonna go in. Nobody's game doorbell able to say that I sort of sculpt in the back. And I got there and 1 of what the people who was working for me, shoes was in tears because she'd seemed said, I had been... I wasn't even aware of it. Because I just said to myself, I'm going to walk through this now and nothing matters. If you you're just gotta get into mindset that says they're not there. Right. So you'd be amazed how often gabby would get a response? Some some kind of rich reaction for the da question. Now dutch elections. Yeah. Po. The growth of anti politics politicians shown in the Dutch new social contract currently topping the polls, could you discuss the upcoming general election in the Netherlands? Johannes Dutch elections coming up Pm Mark rut, not up for reelection, how important is senior in International relations, Oli, Do you think a new part in the Uk could ever have the same sudden and rapid growth in popularity that Peter Z Msc party in the netherlands has had, such that they could pose a challenge the 2 main Uk. Political parties. Now, Alison, I... After your... You brought this up Nobody last week and did a bit of Dutch. I like you got a few messages from friends and Holland, including a friend who was actually having dinner with Peter O. Out time and Santa Fed photograph. And and I think that might mean that if we wanted to interview him on the show, he might be up for it. But what 1 of the things was they said that we hadn't properly covered how he came to prominence This was an amazing thing called the the the child care benefit scandal. So just Just lion. Oh, very good. How's we got? Yeah very. That was very impressive. There was a child a child benefit scandal. Yeah. A bit like you can see this a bit with what Jeremy Hunt doing at the moment where he's saying that he's gonna get tough on benefits. So basically the Dutch government seems to have gone very, very hard on parents claiming child benefits, suggested that they were fraudulent demanded that they paid back a lot of money, particularly targeted immigrants ended up driving a lot of families into hardship. And if I write, Peter Ol was the first person to really come out clearly and call this out. And this brought down the government. No, it was very interesting because we did our bit and we chatted away and I got lots of emails from people saying very nice to hear you talk about the Netherlands. I think that you sort of got it right, but you really there was a big, big, big hole in what you were saying because they were saying is you said that this guy. He's been around for a long time. Basically a kind of you know you'd have said a kind of lifetime back venture really. And he on the right and sort of labor ish mp. They basically exposed this scandal. And it led... I hadn't... I didn't even know about this to my shame, but it led to lots of people killing themselves. It reminded me when Read it reminded you a little bit of that post office scandal here where post masters were being frankly per persecuted over things that they hadn't done. So it was an absolute sort of you know, let's get tough on benefit fraud let's go after them. They went after them this supposed fraud hunt pursued 10 between 70000 people. And of course, then what happened and this this is an email I got from Guy called Paul Bali, And he said that essentially, the government tried to cover it up, they were aid in that by lots of what he equals the media Oli. And on sick gained huge support because he refused to let the government sweep under the carpet. And he was essentially sacked But he kept going as an independent Mp and it really gave him a prominence and a popularity And so he's now set up this new party, the Ns msc, which is was literally just a few weeks old. But interestingly, I then caught another very long email from somebody who said, you're absolutely right that he's gone to the top in no time at all, but it's really weird because he He says he doesn't want to be prime minister. He's given no clarity on who wants to form a coalition with. And the other thing that's happened, is builders the very right wing guy has actually risen in the polls. So the latest polls show this guy sick. In the lead, builders is not far behind and Franz Timber who's leading the labor green coalition. He's a little bit behind them. Now Question from color for you. What big policy are all the major parties missing out on, where is a win being missed? Europe. A big 1 is no. I I'm in I I'd want to go for... I'd want to reopen at least the idea of Customs union. And and that's a huge gap in the market. Now it's something presumably could care Star do it courageous after coming in if he didn't put it in the manifesto? Or would he be in trouble if you didn't put it in the manifesto? I think what you could put in the manifesto is that, you know, the Brexit deal was a disaster, Boris Johnson who led it has been exposed as a complete liar and a Char is to enormous damage to the country and we'll have to review our arrangements with the European Union. Very good. So all I would do. But I just I just don't think they're in the I don't think they're in the same place, But also if if you're serious about growth, then you're going have to do something about our relations with our closest neighbor Was tell you last week about the guys that we were talking to in Ireland. I mean, how many of them were saying that It's just been... It's been a disaster for them as well as for us. But at least they've now got... They can still trade with the the rest of the single market. So here's my big policy that that that I love and that everyone thinks I'm embarking on. I think a huge citizens assembly which could almost be a third branch, a government advisory. So it wouldn't wouldn't be able to pass laws. But I've got a very interesting for instance in Australian academic who suggested that what it might be able to do is if the citizens assembling, it'd be like a jury, so it would be people around the United Kingdom, demographic representative, randomly selected, sitting in this assembly for a period. If the government passed a law that the citizens assembly thought was really bad, they could push it back for a second vote and maybe even a second vote under a secret ballot. So so let let's match and... I don't know that Congress and the senate had all all Republicans had voted sort of not to impeach Trump. Maybe if you pushed it back under a secret ballot, maybe they'd vote differently. Maybe the same would have been true, with getting a soft Brexit through that if you pushed it back and people could vote under a secret ballot, you might have been able to get a soft brexit through. Yeah. And also although there would be there would be some cost to that it they wouldn't be huge because it's not a big spending thing. There's a question actually sort of same theme, you know, quality of democracy, Unlock democracy wants to ask this question. 1 in 7 Uk citizens are currently not registered to vote. That's 8000000 potential votes in the forthcoming election exists outside of the Uk's democratic processes. Should all parties commit to bringing in automatic voter registration in their manifesto. Yes. I'd also like compulsory voting. I like compulsory voting. Where are you lowering the voting age? And no. I'm against you on that. Partly because I think it's a bit... I mean, I don't we don't get drawn down at that, but it's a bit weird because so many bits of our society are about increasing ages from 16 to 18. For example, about your ability to deploy to fight and things like that. Well, I go to loads of schools, you know, and I think most kids in most schools know a lot more about politics. An an awful lot of 50 67. Definitely something I picked up when I was an Mps. If you wanted to be popular in schools, you definitely said, you wanna drop them voting edge to 14 and everyone loves it. The other thing I would do again, pretty cost neutral. I would take John Majors Nolan principles and I would make them somehow applicable with an outside judge to every single member of parliament. Oh, Interesting. Gosh. You'd have to set quite a high bar. You wouldn't want the judge interfering every second. No. Exactly but you know, but just fact of doing it, I think would improve. Be interesting it. But you'd probably wanna set it up with the hope that they would do it once or twice in a parliament. It's really egregious thing. Exactly. Okay, Marie.

Here's another 1, Sam dyson and it relates to the behavior mps. 2 questions in 1. 1, should Mps be allowed to have second jobs that earn more than the standard Mp salary, b should Mps be allowed to work for companies with links to people under the Uk economic sanctions and this is about Brandon Lewis, who is not longer ago in the cabinet and now he's picking up a very large 6 figure slab for is a relationship with some company that's under sanctions. What do we think about Rory Stuart? Well, I think the key question always with this. Is conflict of interest. And I think that's what you really need to focus on bubble. It's not the amount that you earn. It's whether the company you're working for conflicts with your public role. So that's why the most dangerous bit is the lobbying getting involved in contracts that touch companies that you've been involved in all that kind that... That's where the real corruption stuff. He was part he was part of a cabinet which imposed sanctions post the invasion of Ukraine. Yeah. I mean, that that does seem a bit bizarre. I agree. That does seem bit bizarre. Didn't. Now. We 1 of the big questions we haven't really done. So a lot of questions about is Rwanda. Mh. So got 3 3 questions on Rwanda, and they come from To fl, Andrew Watt and Andrew H. To fact would someone discuss the actual cost benefit the Rwanda plan. So so from the legal moral injustice of it. I believe it's been incredibly expensive so far, hundred and 40000000. Here, What, if seen goes ahead of the law which p to a assert definitively that Rwanda is a safe country, What are the implications credibility of the king of the Monarchy? Who has formed to give royal sense to a nonsense I imo. And Andrew Harrison r, seen it's been telling people won't let foreign court block fights rwanda. The Supreme court is a Uk court. How can the prime to get away with lying to people? How does this align with this commitment to integrity professionalism and accountability? So there we go. So very quickly underline thing. And and again, this is maybe for people who've not been following it very closely. The broad idea from the government was that people arriving on boats. And in fact, they suggested at some point all asylum claimants in the Uk would be shipped off to Rwanda, and their asylum claim would be processed in Rwanda, and the British government gave a significant sum of money to the Rwanda a government for the run a government to agree to do this and run a government built some quite upscale accommodation, certainly by Rwanda standards. And when I was in Rwanda, a lot of people going to visit it and and I'm sure they run a government was serious about trying to provide decent accommodation for people. The Supreme court, though knocked down the government's appeal to try to push ahead of this plan. On the ground of something called Ru reform and Ru reform is if you believe a country is likely to send the asylum seekers back to their home country. And they believe that Rwanda had a record of Ru reform. So this is important because Supreme court was not saying that the idea shipping people somewhere is illegal. And that's important because this may be very, very relevant for migrants crossing the mediterranean, there's a very interesting article by Matthew side and in the times basically saying, the asylum system is fundamentally broken because when it was designed, it was not anticipating hundreds of millions of people to have a legitimate claim to asylum them. If somebody sent, is at the moment he says that you won't talk about Libya. Maybe I mean, he mentions Libya on it? Listen, IIII just how crazy this debate has got. I read that R Sun doesn't like the word raf mo. Oh, because it's a bit French. Does send it French. Isn't it? Mean, la means into the crowds, you're sort of rec crowding is what it means. This is why I think soon It's in trouble because when he stood outside number 10 and said Integrity accountability, all that, professionalism integrity, accountability. You've got to deliver on that. And what essentially this whole thing is saying is that We don't like the judgment and therefore, we're going to leg to say that the judgment is wrong By signing a treaty with the country that they say isn't safe for them to say that they're safe, and then we'll say to parliament, that we're saying they're safe as well. And that's the law. This is something that Jonathan consumption, who you're not always a big fan of, partly because he he stood for the restore trust for the National Trust Which you've been gru about a lot. Yeah But I'm I'm mainly a fan. Many fan. And with Jonathan assumption wrote a very good piece on this, saying that he has written calling into question the european court and supreme Courts and he's got a lot of sympathy with the government claiming that's parliament to sovereign. But what parliament cannot do And what it seems to be suggesting that they might try to do is to rule on a matter of fact. Right? They can pass laws, but it's up to the courts to determine whether a country is or is not safe. You can't just rule that a country is safe. Fortunately, I don't think it's gonna happen because we have a very good attorney general in the form of Victoria Apprentice, who's very serious about these things. And I don't think that Victorian apprentice would allow this to happen. Related to this, Story, enormous Spa why is it not in the public interest to publish the full cost of the Bib stock? This is the floating barge in do, which I saw by the way when I was down at the festival that you don't like me talking about. Rental cost running cost staff cost and cost per ahead. I just huge shout report. I mean, honestly, you've done more for the Brit report book festival than any man on earth. It's amazing just yeah. They they want you to go You want to go? I think I'll have to get now that I right now that you've then you can go and see the the Bib Dot. But why you you were the prisons minister, What do you reckon roughly? What do you reckon it would be costing? Huge amount of money. I mean, It'd be costing many hundreds of thousands of pounds a week to run this thing. Why do they think that they shouldn't... This public money? Why shouldn't they publish how much it's costing? I think it'll be in the hundreds of millions by now. So they'll have to eventually when they. I mean, the the... Well the public called office will then Our shoulder office will require. I mean you can't get away, but not publishing your figures. I can't I can't really understand what this not in the public interest stuff about. It sounds to me like the government's embarrassed by how much spending in Sure. And the other question that was there in your the 3 questions, we had loads of questions about Rwanda. But the other 1 that you read out there was about know the cost benefit analysis. I mean, they've let's just remember not a single person has been flown. We're already into the 100000000 plus territory. It is God knows what it will be up to when the legal bills come in. And then they're still determined to go ahead with. So the costs are only going to rise. And meanwhile, if we do get an election without it having happened, what a total waste of time and money? Very good. Right now, we've got a final question, which is max, what books would you recommend understand the Uk political system. Now. There are lots of classics outlet there depending on how serious you wanna want to be? So the 1 of the great classics is a book by Peter Hen c White hall, which goes back many, many years, but is the great sort of investigation of how. How White hall worked. I I would be tempted to say catch 22 is a good insight into it. There's some great books out. By obviously James and O'brien ian dumped. Raphael Bear, who of course, I I recommended last year and then they got told off by you because he managed to put on the front of his book that it been are book of the year. Little little plug though for an amazing book which is quite a serious book, but I think a very, very well observed rye invent book, which is just about to be published called late Soviet to Britain. By Abby. And Am basically argues that neo liberal economics has become as mad as sort of soviet economics under b f. As rigid as sort of defended in an insane way and that the way to understand Britain is this is what she calls an iso morph in other words sir, a sort of weird echo between late Soviet bureaucracy and British economic policy from major through blair to David Cameron and now R Cena. Very good. Very good. I... Have I told you about my my new book. That I've just switched. You just written another a book. Yeah. No wonder you're never doing enough work in the podcast. We've book get it off. Honestly, How many hours research have you done today? No not as much as you probably. Although, They don't know how much time you spent writing this book? What is this book? It's a guide to politics for primary schools. So that's gonna be a classic. You see, look at that as usual, you've beaten me to it. I was a approached by a publisher to write exactly that thing. Well and you've already written it. Point my hut. Do you know what I've really enjoyed it though because it's it's essentially actually... I mean, obviously, my journalist background is on tabloids where you have to sort of you know, try and keep us few words as possible to say quite complicated things, but it's really quite tough to do you, the history of parliament in like 5 paragraphs. And that sort of thing. But I've really enjoyed it. And now it's it's going to the illustrate. It's gonna be 1 of those sort of, you know, lots of nice illustrations and stuff. What a Peter flood? Now okay. That allows me to get in a little plug. So I have been involved in making a documentary called Julius Caesar, the making of a dictator I read about it, that's the first time you about it and even though I asked you last week, how often you talk about the Roman Empire, you didn't even mention it. Well, it's gonna be out next Monday on Bbc 2 at 09:00. I've done it with Tom Holland, The great star of the rest is history. This is this why you've been angry to get Tom Holland on the podcast. I mean, rory, you've got to declare these interests. You just tory votes not be the for that. So this show is my trying to make the case that Julius Caesar was what we mean today by a populist. He is an early play of Donald Trump or Bo scenario, or the fig lay that's now emerging in Argentina. He's somebody who pretends to be on side of the people in order to take power and wreck the entire constitution of rome. And what is tom thing? Tom Holland thinks that Caesar is witty, glamorous, bold, invent and that the whole thing is mesmerizing watching. Then maybe that's being a bit unfair to top.

Revolutionary technology real world results. That's Sap business Ai.\n\nSpeaker 0: Welcome to the rest politics question time with me asked Campbell\n\nSpeaker 3: and with me Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: The rule kick off with something that we're both quite fascinated by, but you're sort of mildly obsessed with that's open Ai, Sam Alt. Red redacted. Good name prayer. Listener. Following open Ais tumultuous weekend, is raised concerns about the stability and alignment of artificial general intelligence with human values.\n\nIn light of this, what measures can governments take to sure that the development and implementation of Ag not only aligns with, but also enhances human welfare. And global. I mean, what the hell is going on?\n\nSpeaker 3: Well, so that... That... That's the first thing. Nobody knows. It's it's really amazing.\n\nThe New york Times has written 5 articles has thrown every journalist they've got in that suddenly their tech pages at it. And they've basically managed to find out nothing. Sam and won't comment. The chair won't comment. Just take it back for a bit for for listeners.\n\nI think most people understand. But open Ai is the absolute center of the artificial intelligence revolution. That's the company that produced chat Gb 3 and chat Gb 4. And Sam Alt was the Ceo of Open. He created this thing and is therefore 1 of the most significant tech entrepreneurs businessman in the world.\n\nAnd the end of last week, he was without any warning fired by his board. Yeah. Which didn't include the chairman of the board who also walked out in protest So the Ceo gone. Chairman of the board has gone, and they didn't bother it seems to tell Microsoft that it just invested 13000000000 dollars in open, which is has 13000 million dollars. But didn't bother to inform them.\n\nSpeaker 0: They... So Microsoft now hired him.\n\nSpeaker 3: So Microsoft has now Sat Na, who's the head of Microsoft has now hired him in to run a an independent research and institute form. The phrase that keeps being repeated by Open ai is that he's been fired for lack of transparency in interactions with the board affect undermining their decision. So the idea is that he was getting on with a agenda is the Ceo that the board didn't endorse. But it's an unbelievable decision. And the story that people seem to be Circling around whether it's sure or not is that Il Who is 1 of the other founders and he's on the board.\n\nIs worried that he wasn't taking seriously enough the ethical risks around Ai that Someone was beginning to lean more and more heavily into the commercial opportunities. And this of course has been a criticism of Elon Musk who we've talked about in the last podcast Must helped to get open Off the ground when it was a charity and has been in a boiling rage ever since now that it's gone partly commercial with the money coming in from Microsoft. And, of course, is also on the side of the fact that Ai is a potential risk. So a lot of this is is caught up. It seems although we can't get to the bottom it yet.\n\nIn a frantic disagreement within the community about whether there are moral risks of it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Il Su has put out a short statement. I deeply regret my participation in the Board's actions. I never intended to harm open Ai I love everything we built together and we'll do everything I can to reunite the company. And obviously, this guy, Alt, who I've never met as is clearly very, very popular. There was a sort of massive walk out.\n\nAnd this is something that we talked about with Must Solomon and Reid hoffman. And essentially there's this argument between people who think that the whole thing is going to be catastrophe and who really, really worried that what they're actually doing with the stuff that they're creating. And those who feel that they're more realist, which is that this is new technology, but it doesn't pose massive extension threats. And that's where Alt was. But it does seem extraordinary that they can despite them being massive, incredibly powerful wealthy companies, still sort of really behaving like startups,\n\nSpeaker 3: they're behaving like startups ups and there's also a sense of how tiny this world is. I mean, absolutely tiny this world. I mean a lot of the people we've been interfering. Are on the boards of various these companies, or of the major investors and various these companies. These are all their friends.\n\nSo. It's it's got much more of a feeling of what I I guess of what it felt like, with you when you were coming into office to 97 of a very close group of people who've known each other. For 15, 20 years who basically, many of them were at stanford for together, Sam Alt ran, the big venture capital firm the most famous sort of tech starter investing firm in California before he he went on to launch Open Ai. Mh Many of these people that we talked about were at Paypal so Elon Greed Hoffman all these people Peter T or knew each when they were setting up Paypal. So no, it's it's a tiny world.\n\nI think the other thing just just quickly. I was having dinner with some very, very interesting international Ceos. So heads a big international companies. American, Swedish, Spanish, etcetera. And how quickly Ai is changing the way they think.\n\nThey were saying that nothing in 40 years of business they ever seen. Is having an impact as quickly as Ai is it's changing the way they think about tools? It's changing the way they think about whole functions in their company or do we even need to have a a call center anymore. Do we even need software engineers, and it's also beginning to generate completely different ideas about what a business model can be? And in fact, I think if you were labor coming in to run the British economy, the great hope would be that Ai might actually lead to a real productivity revolution.\n\nAnd that that might be the thing that would get growth off the ground again. I think this is something Tony Blair has been trying to say isn't no.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. But that's why I think we were both quite pleased that K style gave Peter Kyle, this job that is sort of technology and innovation, which is clearly you know, right this this is right at the heart of it. So I think a government that really did have a strategy for that would, you know, it could be it could be the future growth. We don't know.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I think, I mean, it could be amazing. I mean, the the the problem is of cause people are very skeptical because this is great cliche from an economist. Who said we see computers everywhere except in the economic statistics that technology was supposed to 30, 40 years ago, bring these incredible productivity gains. Mh.\n\nThat it never quite seem to bring 1 of the the jokes is that you get ever better versions of powerpoint, but instead of improving your productivity do you just make ever fancier here, powerpoint decks. So the question Question is is Ai finally going to produce what you want, which is getting more out of the same number of people.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Now your turn.\n\nSpeaker 3: Alright. Here's a here's a question for you. Paragraph films. Why do news reporters scream the most ridiculous and unprofessional comments and questions. Are politicians going in and out of buildings?\n\nAnd is there any strategy of answering these without becoming a story? Should the news be able to use these clips? It really grinds my gears. Can give us an example of some of these questions that they show? What what's kinda?\n\nSpeaker 0: Are you going to resign home secretary?\n\nSpeaker 3: You're right Exactly. And then the more the home secretary it avoids the question the more the question comes. Are you gonna resign home secretary? Or and some sometimes the questions like, are you a liar?\n\nSpeaker 0: I tell well that there was a guy who suddenly suddenly died recently but he's his nickname was Go. And he was the Bbc doorstep guy and he used to stand outside Danny Street and literally to shout those questions. But every now and again somebody answers is the truth. Right Or they react in a way that kind of make... They do something interesting.\n\nSpeaker 3: But what would be your advice to a cabinet minister walking out of Downing Street facing Go.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh 0, sort of smile to move on. But if you think about it, that woman that Johnson made a dame Andrea Jenkins. Yeah. I mean the only thing that she's really known for is basically giving the middle finger. To a bunch of photographers.\n\nI bet you that was in response to a charity question. Right. So said\n\nSpeaker 3: you use is a great photograph.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Exactly. So you might get a reaction. Most of the time is a completely way complete waste of time. I mean, when...\n\nThe only time that I've really had intense sort of personal media scrutiny it was in the build to the the iraq inquiry. And we had them outside the house the whole time. And I just decided day 1, I'm not going to say a single word. At any point outside write house,\n\nSpeaker 3: B.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I'm not going to look at them, react at them nothing...\n\nSpeaker 3: And was it not a bit weird? Because presumably, you knew them all, Some of these people looking standing out shout you. Yeah. And how does it feel to suddenly find that your friends are now turned into a sort of obeying crowd of luna on your front door.\n\nSpeaker 0: The really friendly ones probably wouldn't be banging. Right. They'd they'd be there. But you just have to go into a mindset that says they're not here. It's funny.\n\nWhen not when when actually went to the Iraq inquiry itself. I think Might have told you this before. There was dozens and dozens of media and there were protesters. And the police said to me, the the security people said to me, John go in the back and they said, no, there's no way I'm going in the back. So I walked through and I was so in the zone that I I wasn't even aware that things were being thrown at I was just I just decided I'm gonna walk from a to b, I'm gonna get to that door.\n\nI'm gonna go in. Nobody's game doorbell able to say that I sort of sculpt in the back. And I got there and 1 of what the people who was working for me, shoes was in tears because she'd seemed said, I had been... I wasn't even aware of it. Because I just said to myself, I'm going to walk through this now and nothing matters.\n\nIf you you're just gotta get into mindset that says they're not there. Right. So you'd be amazed how often gabby would get a response?\n\nSpeaker 3: Some some kind of rich reaction for the da question. Now dutch elections. Yeah. Po. The growth of anti politics politicians shown in the Dutch new social contract currently topping the polls, could you discuss the upcoming general election in the Netherlands?\n\nJohannes Dutch elections coming up Pm Mark rut, not up for reelection, how important is senior in International relations, Oli, Do you think a new part in the Uk could ever have the same sudden and rapid growth in popularity that Peter Z Msc party in the netherlands has had, such that they could pose a challenge the 2 main Uk. Political parties. Now, Alison, I... After your... You brought this up Nobody last week and did a bit of Dutch.\n\nI like you got a few messages from friends and Holland, including a friend who was actually having dinner with Peter O. Out time and Santa Fed photograph. And and I think that might mean that if we wanted to interview him on the show, he might be up for it. But what 1 of the things was they said that we hadn't properly covered how he came to prominence This was an amazing thing called the the the child care benefit scandal. So\n\nSpeaker 0: just Just lion.\n\nSpeaker 3: Oh, very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: How's we got?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah very. That was very impressive.\n\nSpeaker 0: There was a child a child benefit scandal.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. A bit like you can see this a bit with what Jeremy Hunt doing at the moment where he's saying that he's gonna get tough on benefits. So basically the Dutch government seems to have gone very, very hard on parents claiming child benefits, suggested that they were fraudulent demanded that they paid back a lot of money, particularly targeted immigrants ended up driving a lot of families into hardship. And if I write, Peter Ol was the first person to really come out clearly and call this out. And this brought down the government.\n\nSpeaker 0: No, it was very interesting because we did our bit and we chatted away and I got lots of emails from people saying very nice to hear you talk about the Netherlands. I think that you sort of got it right, but you really there was a big, big, big hole in what you were saying because they were saying is you said that this guy. He's been around for a long time. Basically a kind of you know you'd have said a kind of lifetime back venture really. And he on the right and sort of labor ish mp.\n\nThey basically exposed this scandal. And it led... I hadn't... I didn't even know about this to my shame, but it led to lots of people killing themselves. It reminded me when Read it reminded you a little bit of that post office scandal here where post masters were being frankly per persecuted over things that they hadn't done.\n\nSo it was an absolute sort of you know, let's get tough on benefit fraud let's go after them. They went after them this supposed fraud hunt pursued 10 between 70000 people. And of course, then what happened and this this is an email I got from Guy called Paul Bali, And he said that essentially, the government tried to cover it up, they were aid in that by lots of what he equals the media Oli. And on sick gained huge support because he refused to let the government sweep under the carpet. And he was essentially sacked But he kept going as an independent Mp and it really gave him a prominence and a popularity And so he's now set up this new party, the Ns msc, which is was literally just a few weeks old.\n\nBut interestingly, I then caught another very long email from somebody who said, you're absolutely right that he's gone to the top in no time at all, but it's really weird because he He says he doesn't want to be prime minister. He's given no clarity on who wants to form a coalition with. And the other thing that's happened, is builders the very right wing guy has actually risen in the polls. So the latest polls show this guy sick. In the lead, builders is not far behind and Franz Timber who's leading the labor green coalition.\n\nHe's a little bit behind them.\n\nSpeaker 3: Now Question from color for you. What big policy are all the major parties missing out on, where is a win being missed?\n\nSpeaker 0: Europe.\n\nSpeaker 3: A big 1 is no. I I'm in I I'd want to go for... I'd want to reopen at least the idea of Customs union. And and that's a huge gap in the market. Now it's something presumably could care Star do it courageous after coming in if he didn't put it in the manifesto?\n\nOr would he be in trouble if you didn't put it in the manifesto?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think what you could put in the manifesto is that, you know, the Brexit deal was a disaster, Boris Johnson who led it has been exposed as a complete liar and a Char is to enormous damage to the country and we'll have to review our arrangements with the European Union.\n\nSpeaker 3: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: So all I would do. But I just I just don't think they're in the I don't think they're in the same place, But also if if you're serious about growth, then you're going have to do something about our relations with our closest neighbor Was tell you last week about the guys that we were talking to in Ireland. I mean, how many of them were saying that It's just been... It's been a disaster for them as well as for us. But at least they've now got...\n\nThey can still trade with the the rest of the single market. So here's my big\n\nSpeaker 3: policy that that that I love and that everyone thinks I'm embarking on. I think a huge citizens assembly which could almost be a third branch, a government advisory. So it wouldn't wouldn't be able to pass laws. But I've got a very interesting for instance in Australian academic who suggested that what it might be able to do is if the citizens assembling, it'd be like a jury, so it would be people around the United Kingdom, demographic representative, randomly selected, sitting in this assembly for a period. If the government passed a law that the citizens assembly thought was really bad, they could push it back for a second vote and maybe even a second vote under a secret ballot.\n\nSo so let let's match and... I don't know that Congress and the senate had all all Republicans had voted sort of not to impeach Trump. Maybe if you pushed it back under a secret ballot, maybe they'd vote differently. Maybe the same would have been true, with getting a soft Brexit through that if you pushed it back and people could vote under a secret ballot, you might have been able to get a soft brexit through. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And also although there would be there would be some cost to that it they wouldn't be huge because it's not a big spending thing. There's a question actually sort of same theme, you know, quality of democracy, Unlock democracy wants to ask this question. 1 in 7 Uk citizens are currently not registered to vote. That's 8000000 potential votes in the forthcoming election exists outside of the Uk's democratic processes. Should all parties commit to bringing in automatic voter registration in their manifesto.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. I'd also like compulsory voting. I like compulsory voting.\n\nSpeaker 0: Where are you lowering the voting age?\n\nSpeaker 3: And no. I'm against you on that. Partly because I think it's a bit... I mean, I don't we don't get drawn down at that, but it's a bit weird because so many bits of our society are about increasing ages from 16 to 18. For example, about your ability to deploy to fight and things like that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I go to loads of schools, you know, and I think most kids in most schools know a lot more about politics. An an awful lot of 50 67.\n\nSpeaker 3: Definitely something I picked up when I was an Mps. If you wanted to be popular in schools, you definitely said, you wanna drop them voting edge to 14 and everyone loves it.\n\nSpeaker 0: The other thing I would do again, pretty cost neutral. I would take John Majors Nolan principles and I would make them somehow applicable with an outside judge to every single member of parliament.\n\nSpeaker 3: Oh, Interesting. Gosh. You'd have to set quite a high bar. You wouldn't want the judge interfering every second.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Exactly but you know, but just fact of doing it, I think would improve.\n\nSpeaker 3: Be interesting it. But you'd probably wanna set it up with the hope that they would do it once or twice in a parliament. It's really egregious thing. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay, Marie.

What do we think about Rory Stuart?\n\nSpeaker 3: Well, I think the key question always with this. Is conflict of interest. And I think that's what you really need to focus on bubble. It's not the amount that you earn. It's whether the company you're working for conflicts with your public role.\n\nSo that's why the most dangerous bit is the lobbying getting involved in contracts that touch companies that you've been involved in all that kind that... That's where the real corruption stuff.\n\nSpeaker 0: He was part he was part of a cabinet which imposed sanctions post the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I mean, that that does seem a bit bizarre. I agree. That does seem bit bizarre. Didn't.\n\nNow. We 1 of the big questions we haven't really done. So a lot of questions about is Rwanda. Mh. So got 3 3 questions on Rwanda, and they come from To fl, Andrew Watt and Andrew H.\n\nTo fact would someone discuss the actual cost benefit the Rwanda plan. So so from the legal moral injustice of it. I believe it's been incredibly expensive so far,\n\nSpeaker 0: hundred and 40000000.\n\nSpeaker 3: Here, What, if seen goes ahead of the law which p to a assert definitively that Rwanda is a safe country, What are the implications credibility of the king of the Monarchy? Who has formed to give royal sense to a nonsense I imo. And Andrew Harrison r, seen it's been telling people won't let foreign court block fights rwanda. The Supreme court is a Uk court. How can the prime to get away with lying to people?\n\nHow does this align with this commitment to integrity professionalism and accountability? So there we go. So very quickly underline thing. And and again, this is maybe for people who've not been following it very closely. The broad idea from the government was that people arriving on boats.\n\nAnd in fact, they suggested at some point all asylum claimants in the Uk would be shipped off to Rwanda, and their asylum claim would be processed in Rwanda, and the British government gave a significant sum of money to the Rwanda a government for the run a government to agree to do this and run a government built some quite upscale accommodation, certainly by Rwanda standards. And when I was in Rwanda, a lot of people going to visit it and and I'm sure they run a government was serious about trying to provide decent accommodation for people. The Supreme court, though knocked down the government's appeal to try to push ahead of this plan. On the ground of something called Ru reform and Ru reform is if you believe a country is likely to send the asylum seekers back to their home country. And they believe that Rwanda had a record of Ru reform.\n\nSo this is important because Supreme court was not saying that the idea shipping people somewhere is illegal. And that's important because this may be very, very relevant for migrants crossing the mediterranean, there's a very interesting article by Matthew side and in the times basically saying, the asylum system is fundamentally broken because when it was designed, it was not anticipating hundreds of millions of people to have a legitimate claim to asylum them.\n\nSpeaker 0: If somebody sent, is at the moment he says that you won't talk about Libya.\n\nSpeaker 3: Maybe I mean, he mentions Libya on it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Listen, IIII just how crazy this debate has got. I read that R Sun doesn't like the word raf mo.\n\nSpeaker 3: Oh, because it's a bit French. Does send it French. Isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Mean, la means into the crowds, you're sort of rec crowding is what it means. This is why I think soon It's in trouble because when he stood outside number 10 and said Integrity accountability, all that, professionalism integrity, accountability. You've got to deliver on that. And what essentially this whole thing is saying is that We don't like the judgment and therefore, we're going to leg to say that the judgment is wrong By signing a treaty with the country that they say isn't safe for them to say that they're safe, and then we'll say to parliament, that we're saying they're safe as well. And that's the law.\n\nSpeaker 3: This is something that Jonathan consumption, who you're not always a big fan of, partly because he he stood for the restore trust for the National Trust Which you've been gru about a lot.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah But I'm I'm mainly a fan.\n\nSpeaker 3: Many fan. And with Jonathan assumption wrote a very good piece on this, saying that he has written calling into question the european court and supreme Courts and he's got a lot of sympathy with the government claiming that's parliament to sovereign. But what parliament cannot do And what it seems to be suggesting that they might try to do is to rule on a matter of fact. Right? They can pass laws, but it's up to the courts to determine whether a country is or is not safe.\n\nYou can't just rule that a country is safe. Fortunately, I don't think it's gonna happen because we have a very good attorney general in the form of Victoria Apprentice, who's very serious about these things. And I don't think that Victorian apprentice would allow this to happen.\n\nSpeaker 0: Related to this, Story, enormous Spa why is it not in the public interest to publish the full cost of the Bib stock? This is the floating barge in do, which I saw by the way when I was down at the festival that you don't like me talking about. Rental cost running cost staff cost and cost per ahead.\n\nSpeaker 3: I just huge shout report. I mean, honestly, you've done more for the Brit report book festival than any man on earth. It's amazing just yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: They they want you to go You want to go?\n\nSpeaker 3: I think I'll have to get now\n\nSpeaker 0: that I right now\n\nSpeaker 3: that you've then you can go\n\nSpeaker 0: and see the the Bib Dot. But why you you were the prisons minister, What do you reckon roughly? What do you reckon it would be costing?\n\nSpeaker 3: Huge amount of money. I mean, It'd be costing many hundreds of thousands of pounds a week to run this thing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Why do they think that they shouldn't... This public money? Why shouldn't they publish how much it's costing? I think it'll be in the hundreds of millions by now.\n\nSpeaker 3: So they'll have to eventually when they. I mean, the the... Well the public called office will then Our shoulder office will require. I mean you can't get away, but not publishing your figures. I can't I can't really understand what this not in the public interest stuff about.\n\nIt sounds to me like the government's embarrassed by how much spending in\n\nSpeaker 0: Sure. And the other question that was there in your the 3 questions, we had loads of questions about Rwanda. But the other 1 that you read out there was about know the cost benefit analysis. I mean, they've let's just remember not a single person has been flown. We're already into the 100000000 plus territory.\n\nIt is God knows what it will be up to when the legal bills come in. And then they're still determined to go ahead with. So the costs are only going to rise. And meanwhile, if we do get an election without it having happened, what a total waste of time and money?\n\nSpeaker 3: Very good. Right now, we've got a final question, which is max, what books would you recommend understand the Uk political system. Now. There are lots of classics outlet there depending on how serious you wanna want to be? So the 1 of the great classics is a book by Peter Hen c White hall, which goes back many, many years, but is the great sort of investigation of how.\n\nHow White hall worked. I I would be tempted to say catch 22 is a good insight into it. There's some great books out. By obviously James and O'brien ian dumped. Raphael Bear, who of course, I I recommended last year and then they got told off by you because he managed to put on the front of his book that it been are book of the year.\n\nLittle little plug though for an amazing book which is quite a serious book, but I think a very, very well observed rye invent book, which is just about to be published called late Soviet to Britain. By Abby. And Am basically argues that neo liberal economics has become as mad as sort of soviet economics under b f. As rigid as sort of defended in an insane way and that the way to understand Britain is this is what she calls an iso morph in other words sir, a sort of weird echo between late Soviet bureaucracy and British economic policy from major through blair to David Cameron and now R Cena.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very good. Very good. I... Have I told you about my my new book. That I've just switched.\n\nSpeaker 3: You just written another a book. Yeah. No wonder you're never doing enough work in the podcast. We've book\n\nSpeaker 0: get it off. Honestly, How many hours research have you done today?\n\nSpeaker 3: No not as much as you probably. Although, They don't know how much time you spent writing this book? What is this book?\n\nSpeaker 0: It's a guide to politics for primary schools. So that's gonna be a classic.\n\nSpeaker 3: You see, look at that as usual, you've beaten me to it. I was a approached by a publisher to write exactly that thing. Well and you've already written it. Point my hut.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you know what I've really enjoyed it though because it's it's essentially actually... I mean, obviously, my journalist background is on tabloids where you have to sort of you know, try and keep us few words as possible to say quite complicated things, but it's really quite tough to do you, the history of parliament in like 5 paragraphs. And that sort of thing. But I've really enjoyed it. And now it's it's going to the illustrate.\n\nIt's gonna be 1 of those sort of, you know, lots of nice illustrations and stuff. What a\n\nSpeaker 3: Peter flood? Now okay. That allows me to get in a little plug. So I have been involved in making a documentary called Julius Caesar, the making of a dictator\n\nSpeaker 0: I read about it, that's the first time you about it and even though I asked you last week, how often you talk about the Roman Empire, you didn't even mention it.\n\nSpeaker 3: Well, it's gonna be out next Monday on Bbc 2 at 09:00. I've done it with Tom Holland, The great star of the rest is history.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is this why you've been angry to get Tom Holland on the podcast. I mean, rory, you've got to declare these interests. You just tory\n\nSpeaker 3: votes not be the for that. So this show is my trying to make the case that Julius Caesar was what we mean today by a populist. He is an early play of Donald Trump or Bo scenario, or the fig lay that's now emerging in Argentina. He's somebody who pretends to be on side of the people in order to take power and wreck the entire constitution of rome.\n\nSpeaker 0: And what is tom thing?\n\nSpeaker 3: Tom Holland thinks that Caesar is witty, glamorous, bold, invent and that the whole thing is mesmerizing watching. Then maybe that's being a bit unfair to top.\n\nSpeaker 0: He he did deliver or is it said to have delivered or has had delivered through history, the greatest sound of all time.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes Gone. Give us give us your sound bad.\n\nSpeaker 0: V V Vic.\n\nSpeaker 3: It's good isn't it. It's good. Good It's good. Brilliant. He he also did lot.\n\nHe also, you know, put the word July into the into our calendar that's old Julius. Yeah. Reshape the whole calendar. And we're gonna have the same debate, of course, around Napoleon.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 3: We're again Andrew Roberts and people are saying you know, much under underrated. Did wonderful things for France and people like me are trying to line up and say is a g dictator.\n\nSpeaker 0: Ridley Scott film is is getting rave reviews in Britain and getting sort of slammed in France. No. How did you resolve the argument? Do do it do we have a public vote? Did you have a jewel?\n\nWhat did you do?\n\nSpeaker 3: No. I mean, you just watch the documentary and it's it's rather beautifully done at the part the Caesar and Kate were acted out, and we voice over what they were trying to do and what they were trying to achieve and what they thought. III really enjoyed it. I think so You want document on each Rome next Monday 09:00?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, all those people who sent messaged last week, say does he really think about rome How many times did you say, 12 a day or something? I now understand it. That's been a more recent thing, but not all the time. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 3: Not all the time now. No. And congratulations on the vocabulary and have a\n\nSpeaker 0: a great day. All the best.",
