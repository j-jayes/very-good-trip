To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show Just go to the rest is politics.com. That's the rest is politics.com. Welcome to the restless politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And with me, Alastair Campbell. Very good. Where do you want to start us off? What about I mean, we don't like talking about him because he's just so awful, but Mark Haines wants to know, Why did Boris Johnson and the former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison go to Israel? What could they possibly achieve there, and is this their role? What did you make of it? Well, I think Their visits will be welcomed by the Israeli government. I mean, I think the Israeli government made a great deal of their visits because they saw it Did they? Sign of solidarity. And they they there were a lot of photographs Put out some not the kind of newspapers you'd read, but The Telegraph, for example. Page 3 had sort of half the page showing Boris Johnson walking through Jerusalem looking, you know, anxious with Israeli ministers with him. But I think it's something that Israel is looking for big public symbols of solidarity, He sure enough, he came out and gave a very strong, very steady statement. So I think it's it's largely symbolic. What did you make of what he's up to? I was slightly It turned off here when I saw that they he did a, quote, exclusive interview with GB News. With which he's just got a just got a job at. He's a new employer. Well, I noticed the Telegraph, although it carried the photograph, I heard very little about him because I imagine they're a bit irritated that this person who they used to pay Â£250,000 a year to is now GB News and a column in the mail. Yeah. Yeah. I just find, Johnson and and Morrison to a lesser extent, but they're they both, to me, are just the symbols of the the populism that we should be getting rid of and not giving them that much of a platform. So I form. So I don't know. I must tell you, by the way, I I spoke at the Mansion House the other night at a a dinner, and the catering was provided by The Clink. You know, The Clink Charity? Yes. We have wonderful charity. Fantastic. Starts in Brixton, so quick and remind people about Clink if you wanna support it. So love the idea, and the idea is to train prisoners up in different Bits of Catering, they run a prison, they run a restaurant in Brixton Prison called the Clink where you can go and eat. But also when The program leaves the prison. They're often met at the gate. They're helped into a job. They have catering companies who help employ them. Well, they do City and Guilds while they're there. So the the the dinner that we had at the Mansion House, the catering was done by guys on day release. Amazing. Anyway, what it meant was that I was able to start my speech by getting able to thank the caterers and say that by the time we get to our comfortable beds, so the chef who's just cooked us that wonderful meal We'll be back in his cell in Brixton. And wouldn't it be marvelous if in a year's time, the same function was performed by Dovidic Coveys and Boris Johnson? Ah. And it went there very, very well. I got told off, actually. I gave a speech at Saint Martin's in the Fields and, got slightly told off for referring to Boris Johnson to my speech. Somebody said to me, your your speech would be more powerful if you hinted that that's who you're referring to, but that you discredit yourself by signing up. Unless something dramatic happens to him in the next month. Shall we not mention him for at least a month? Very good. Excellent. That's very good. Okay. Excellent. From Russ Macnaughton, what do you make of the idea that Robert Malley was steering the US towards allowing Iran to be a more dominant power in the Middle East? So This is a real inside Washington baseball story, I would have thought, for 99% of listeners. Rob Malley is somebody that I know a little. He was an American diplomat. He was the special envoy for Iran. He played a very important part in Obama's, negotiations around the nuclear deterrent. He ran the international crisis group as a predecessor to Comfort Hero, who we are about to interview on leading. And Rob has been suspended, and there's not much clarity around why he was suspended. And it appears to be Suggestions going around that he'd mishandle classified documents, but at the heart of it all seems to be a disagreement within the administration around the way that Rob and various people that Rob was Working with were reaching out to Iran and dealing with the Iranian media and with Iranian expatriate groups. But fascinated that this is a story that Rusman Northland's got his things around. And it is interesting because Rob Malley was one of the most trusted central parts of the Biden team, and it's very interesting that he's been Senate. Are you are you hinting there that he was possibly thought of getting too close to the Iranians? Yeah. That seems to be the implication. Yeah. Because one of the one of the things I've been reading, I can't remember. I was reading about this, but it was where Netanyahu, in the Israeli context, celebrating what he saw as the demise of the Arabists in the foreign office. You with the foreign office tradition is missing from the very start of the I'm sorry. I'm just broken your rule, but I do remember when I'd just become the minister Just stay in the foreign office at the Boris Johnson Whiskey Park. The rule for a secretary. 3 minutes. No. But it it relates to it because it I it's always struck with me. Boris Johnson advised me to breakfast In the traveler's club just around the corner from where he was living, in Carlton Terrace, which is a foreign secretary's house. And he turned up late with his bodyguards, and there was no real breakfast available. But What he did was rant at me about Arabists in the foreign office, and the implication was very strongly, you're an Arabist, Rory. You're part of this Arabist thing, and I'm gonna make a speech. And he was essentially suggesting to be over breakfast that he was gonna make a very punchy speech about Islam, Arabs, terrorism, calling out the Arabists, making the case for Israel. So this thing about the Arabists Mhmm. Which goes all the way back to Lawrence of Arabia And was at the heart of the problems, the British mandate in Palestine when Britain was trying to balance very, very successfully Jewish and Arab movements within Palestine during the thirties and forties. But the accusation was always that the British Arabists We're too much on the side of the Arabs and not sufficiently press ready, and it was interesting to hear Boris Johnson leaning into that quite as hard. Well, that and and I think there's something in it. I can recall To one of the during one of the kind of big crises in the Middle East when we were in power, I can't remember the guy's name, but there was somebody there from the foreign office that was I mean, you couldn't get him to say anything really positive about Israel or indeed about the United States in relation to their handling of this issue. So there was maybe something in that, but but it was interesting that Netanyahu saw that as a significant thing, that the foreign officers he saw it was Well, it's it's been incredibly traumatic because by the time and this was partly on the new labor, actually, that you broke the link between, the language training, The area of expertise and the ambassadorial jobs. So by 2010, 12 out of the 15 ambassadors in the Middle East couldn't speak Arabic, Whereas a generation before, they had all been through Arabic language training often in in a language school in in Lebanon. And The far off has really prided itself on people who spoke really beautiful Fusil. The the last, legacy of this is someone we've spoken about for who who you appointed was Gerard Russell, On access there. Very excellent man who does speak very beautiful Arabic, but there definitely was a period where that was broken. Yeah. I think I think you can get through this one without mentioning Boris Johnson because you've now you you you have 1 mark against your name, and we've got a month to go now. Katrina Riddell, the COVID inquiry has raised massive issues about the roles of civil servants and special advisers. But what exactly is the difference between the 2, and who do and who should politicians actually listen to. The difference is that civil servants sit the civil service selection board, join, and serve a full professional career, Traditionally, a 40 years ending up with an index linked pension, and they remain regardless of which government comes in and which government goes out, and they work their way up. Then she become directors, director generals, permanent secretaries. And that's really 99.9% of the government are these professional civil servants. But sitting At the central government are this very small collection of people of whom the members of parliament who become ministers are one lot, and the other lot are these special advisers who are appointed by the ministers by whichever political party happens to be in power. There will be a number of them in number 10, and then each Minister will have 1, 2, or 3 of these people. Usually, somebody focusing on press and somebody focusing on the more political side. And People who enjoy, yes, minister or yes, prime minister, there's already the beginnings of one of these figures who pops around the corner. Anyway, give us your sense on the difference between the 2 and how you see the the use of the special adviser and how you think about them. I think the significance has grown probably. I was a special adviser, and I was appointed by Tony Blair. And the big difference And and you came in from the outside. You had been a civil servant all your life. No. No. No. No. Jonathan Powell had been a civil servant. Most of the special advisers were from different sorts of out grounds. We had a I can't remember how many we had in total. You know, it wasn't hundreds. It was in double figures, but it wasn't hundreds. Gordon had quite a few in the treasury. I think we're limited to most ministers Ed Balls was 1. Ed Balls, Ed Miliband, was the other. Often their roots to becoming MPs. George Osborne, David Cameron was specialized, Matt Hancock Well, if I go through some of ours, Andrew Adonis went to the House of Lords. Pat McFadden, hopefully in the next cabinet. James Purnell, who went into the cabinet. David Miliband. So a lot of them did go that route, but the big difference is that we, in a sense, were allowed to be political. Now I wasn't allowed to represent the prime minister in a political capacity. I couldn't go and do a number 10 briefing and start, you know, slanging off the opposition, but we were allowed to give political advice as well as, as it were, policy advice. I think that's the big difference. And I think that the politicians, it depends on the politicians, I think they probably do listen more to special advisers, in that the special adviser is probably in their ear more. The special adviser is probably likely to be at all the meetings, whereas a civil servant would dip in and out according to what it was that was being discussed. But I there were some ministers who actually if their relations with the civil reserves are very, very good, the special adviser might play a secondary role. But I think in most cases I don't know what it was like when you were in government, But I think in most cases, the special adviser was probably the one that the minister listened to most. What I noticed is that it can be tricky because often the special advisers are very Young, bright, but not often deep specialists in the particular area they're working on. And so I remember as a backbencher Being pretty frustrated with the special advisers in defense, the foreign office, DFID, talking about things like Afghanistan because they were, You know, bright people in their late twenties. And they've probably been somewhere else 5 minutes earlier Exactly. Because their ministry just moved in. And yet you're absolutely right. Often the minister listened to them very carefully, and they Really processed the papers for the minister and whispered in the minister's ear. There's a tradition in the conservative party also that, frustrated me. People like Priti Patel would do it of bringing in special advisers from things like the Taxpayers' Alliance, which is a sort of Tufton Street Yeah. Setup. So when I was in DFID, she brought in a special adviser who was Very much there to make the radical case against aid, the sort of, so I think people can use their special advisers as sort of disruptors ticket to challenge the sources. Now there's a question here from somebody called Matthew Taylor. I don't know if that is Matthew Taylor who was a special adviser. I suspect he's not. What are your views on how to better support the mental health of politicians given the significant abuse they often face, and how can we break down these barriers to encourage and for more young people to get involved in seeking elected office. I was very interested in the, you read one of the adverts recently for BetterHelp, And I was interested that you said that you'd been getting therapy for the 1st time. Isn't that something you'd have benefited from when you were actually an active politician? Yes. Probably. I mean, I think I definitely benefit from it. What made you decide to do it? Oh, that I was feeling very unsettled, and partly trying to process my experience as a politician. I mean, I think my book, politics on the edge, says he plugging it again, is largely about trying to describe why it is such A bizarre, horrifying, strange environment. Did you find the this is my motto, Think and Ink. Did you find that writing the book itself helped? Yes. Really helped. Really helped me clarify and really dig into why I found it such an odd profession. I mean, I was thinking about this last night. Somebody was Trying to say to me, what's wrong with it? And the the example I came up with was Liz Truss that I remember arriving as the environment minister. I'd been in the job for a few hours, And I thought, this is unbelievable. It's so wonderful. I'm now the environment minister, and this is my chance to really make a difference, to Plants another 300,000,000 trees to clean up our ad, clean up our beaches and water. What a privilege. And this trust came to see me and said, Rory, I want you to produce a 10 point plan on the national park. And I thought, that's fantastic. I'm the national parks minister. Okay? So I said secretary said, great. I'll get Chief executive's national parks then will spend a few weeks working on this, and I'll be able to come up with a vision for the next 20 years, a national parks, United Kingdom. You imagine how wonderful that And she said, no. No. No. I I want it by Thursday evening. It was Tuesday. And I said, what what are you talking about? And she said, come on, Rory. How difficult can it be? I can tell you. You know? Number 1, get young people into nature. Number 2, clean Clean up the national parks. I don't know. We're gonna get 7 together. And sure enough, Debbie Telegraph, Friday morning, Liz Truss's seven point plan for the national parks. So that's probably a classic example of Liz Truss if she needs something. And they said to her special adviser, I'm having lunch at the Telegraph. I want to give them a story. What would it be? Classic. Yeah. And she then didn't think about national parks Ever again, I didn't think she ever visited the National Park. And and I thought, so odd. I mean, this is part of the sickness, the whole thing, that that she wouldn't feel. What an amazing opportunity to really think hard about national parks. And what about this question about supporting mental the support of the mental health politicians? I I had Several MPs, not all Labour, but mainly Labour, several MPs who contacted me before the last election saying that they Couldn't face the campaign, and they were thinking of jacking it in or what advice did I have to get them through psychologically, etcetera. And I didn't realize, having worked there for so many years, I didn't realize there actually is a psychological support network within parliament. But so many of the MPs don't want to use it because they're worried about the stigma attached to it. Yeah. I think the stigma's going down a bit. Oh, yeah. It's going down a lot. It's good about that. But but it remains the most poisonous work environment. I mean, we'll we'll see more about this, but there's some horrifying revelations about the Conservative Party now Coming out where it looks as though the party may have been paying victims who were raped by a serving MP and that this is all being covered up. I mean, it's so Horrible. The combination of lack of seriousness, genuine kind of bullying and brutality running from the former speaker right the way through the backbenchers, The the sexless assaults and the there's sexless assaults and allegations. I mean, it it is the most bizarre When when you when you read I don't know if you've read Chris Bryant's book, but when he lists all the kind of personal life scandals that there have been in this parliament. And I think the chapter is called, is this the worst parliament we've ever had? And he he reaches the conclusion that it that it is. And some of these things now, it's almost like they just come and go in a day, and people just move on to the next one. I don't think there's any environment like it. And, of course, One of the things that we should be thinking about is people talk about it, and they never do anything about it. What would it mean to have some sort of induction process for MPs to try to Share values with them to try to set up standards, to try to provide an some kind of HR system in a light touch way to guide people. And The problem is everybody every MP is a sole trader who thinks they're accountable to their constituents, and they don't really have a boss, which allows them to behave in these Completely horrifying kind of, When I was at, the Dorset, the Britpop Book Festival doing the q and a, there was a question which has been sort of Troubling me ever since, it was a woman who was talking about abuse in social media and so forth. And she actually if I paraphrase her question, she said, you know, how have you managed to go from being a kind of national and international hate figure to something that we all quite like. And I've thought about that a lot because I think I definitely Said to myself, I have to develop a really thick skin, and it has to be real. And developing a thick skin whilst remaining sensitive to things that do matter, sensitive to people, sensitive to opinions, sensitive to the needs of others, which I think you need in in politics. I think it's very, very hard thing to do. I think a lot of MPs could do with actually thinking about how they do that. I definitely did it by by saying to myself, I am not going to care what most people think about me. I'm going to care about what the people I care about think about me. That's it. Right. And I find that's the only way that you're problem, isn't it? Because the the risk is you develop Thick skin, and then you end up lacking empathy for everyone. Yeah. But I think as long as you care for the people that you care about, you will hopefully have the empathy. Have the empathy. Yeah. Well, Alastair, I think we should take a break. Question for you. Jim McGuinn, if Labour win the next election, what are the top 3 things they must do on day 1? Come. Give us Istanbul, give us 2 out of 3. Well, day 1, the first thing you have to do is appoint a cabinet and appoint a government. That's the first thing. I day 1 is also when you dropped your independence of Bank of England No. I think it was day 2. Day 2? I think it was day 2. Right. Pretty quick. Pretty quick. It might even been I can't it was very, very soon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you'd kept that up your sleeve to do immediately? I suspect that so let's say Keir Starmer becomes prime minister. He goes outside Downing Street. He makes a speech setting out a sort of the big picture thing. I think I think actually being clear about a strategy for growth has Got to be the first thing. I'm probably indicating that this is a long term plan. Am I right that the Bank of England thing you'd kept secret until that moment and so it was a sort of surprise for people or not? It may have just surprised me, you don't remember it as being kept secret particularly. No. I think it was. Right. Yeah. It was. It was we talked a lot about, you know, the importance of economic stability. Right. And, you know, we just interviewed Mark Carney on on Leading. It was that's why I was very interested to ask him whether he felt that it was surprising that the country took so long to get an independent bank of England, and he basically said yes. But, no, that was very much Gordon Brown wanting to arrive with a really big moment, and my god, it worked. Politically, economically. It's good to Labour define one of those things, although with with they're not gonna reveal it on The rest is politics because they need to keep it secret today too. Well, I think what I think it should be, Rory, is to say, well, look, you know, we've basically got the message from the public. The reason we've been related is people realize that Brexit It's a total dead duck. And, we'll we'll we'll go back in. We're gonna get Oh, we think referendum is so divisive, we won't bother having 1. There we go. That that would really wake people up. Certainly, Ravi. And Bobby is highly unlikely. Excited about that. Tom Huitzinger, does Rory ever get frustrated at Alisa's informality towards guests Stryke, distinguished colleagues, I e, Rory referring to Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor versus Campbell's army. Well, shall we what was the person called who asked this question? Tom Huitzinger. Tom Huitzinger? Mister Huitzinger, do you? Mister mister Huitzinger, OBE. I'm going to throw it in a loner for it. What you don't know, Tom, if I may, is that before we started recording, I said to Governor Schwarzenegger, what do we call you? Arnie, Arnold, whatever. And he said, you call me whatever you wanna call me. But you you don't think that actually Asking that question, it's very difficult for someone to say, I want you to call me governor. No. But he could have said, well, most people call me governor. Right? But I don't buy this thing about look. I think with American presidents, if if I were to meet Donald Trump right now, I'm not comparing what's left to Trump, There is no way in the world I am calling him mister president. But what do you think what do you think he'd reply if you said to him, what what do you want me to call you? Trump. Yeah. God, Your majesty, your highness. No. I probably am more informal than you. I never called Tony Blair prime minister. That's true. I don't I don't I don't I don't know, but I mean, in the job. I didn't go in to say, would you like a cup of tea, prime minister? I actually when I, text Rishi Sunak, I've stopped saying Rishi. I now say prime minister. Do you? Even along the same Can you show me the last text you sent, and what did you reply? Well, I think he he replied thanks. I think I'd congratulated him on something. Creep. You told me you told me that that you realized whether you become an awful politician was whether you started Congratsulating David Cameron on his speeches. Genuinely he done, which impressed me. Now the AI summit. I don't know. I'm not gonna get that Sorry. You can't just expect me to put my whole life out there. I've had a lot of ideas. Why did you call him governor though? Speaking of that, actually, there was we've got a question on this given what you've just done to me. What? Steve Henderson, given that Westminster and Scottish politicians get away with deleting WhatsApp messages, what's the point of a public inquiry? Should the law be changed to make an offense for a politician to delete messages, or should Alastair have a right to read my little text to Rishi Sunak? He is the prime minister. You are an active political figure even if you're not a politician. You might be influencing decisions for all we know. You're being very secretive about these secret discussions you never told me about. Unless it was, Rishi, you may think we give you a bit of a hard time on this podcast, but we'd like to have you on as a guest. Unless that was your message. That might have been the message. Yeah. No. I think the WhatsApp thing look. We the culture has moved. But I I think that as the culture has moved, if you're in public life now, I think other than for personal family stuff and what have you. I think you gotta be very, very careful about what you say. One of the problems, though, is that you brought in new Labour brought in this Freedom of Information Act, Which means that anything that you say and write down in a formal civil service process is liable to be released So it drove people partly to WhatsApps. Well, it drove us to Post it notes a lot of the time. Post it notes. Yeah. And that is problematic Because actually that's less good for government because it means there's not a proper record of things and not documented in the right way. But some of these allegations actually, Hannah McNamara said That her texts and WhatsApps have been deleted by the civil service. They'd asked for her phone, and they just deleted them. Nicola Sturgeon has deleted all the WhatsApps that she Exchange during the COVID inquiry. But I think the problem is that if you then go after WhatsApps, the politicians will then be driven to even more desperate measures. Look. Tony I think Tony Blair says in his book that he kind of thinks that freedom of information broadly was a mistake. And I I don't think it was a mistake. I think that there should be kind of as much transparency as you can four. But in a serious political culture, which we don't really have, there would be a general understanding that that does mean That there has to be a process where there can be division and disagreement as policy is being developed without every single exchange over a decision being hung out for And and, of course, the problem is that you want to encourage politicians to admit when they don't know things, ask stupid questions, Come up with controversial ideas. And, of course, you freeze all that if there's a risk that that is immediately FOI'd and there's a front page story saying, you know, Rory Stewart asked, where exactly is Cameroon when he was the African minister? Yeah. Which actually is not a terrible question. Not a terrible question. I didn't know exactly where Cameroon was when I was the African minister, But I wouldn't want that all over the front page. And you see No. You wouldn't. Now Earl Haig, Alastair, when did you meet Quentin Tarantino and Ian Duncan Smith? And This is an extraordinary photograph apparently in front of what looks like a sort of Christmas tree and a rather nice column. And, actually, it isn't a picture of Quentin Tarantino. It's a picture of Dominic Cummings, Ian Duncan Smith, and a very youthful, smiling Alastair Campbell. And Earl Haig is Presumably the descendant of general Haig. I don't. He is. Yeah. He's an Earl, isn't he? He's the descendant of Haig who commanded us in the first world. Just be somebody who's called Earl Haig. No. No. He isn't. No. No. There is only 1 Earl Haig. He's a member of the House of Lords. He's descended from the general in the first world war. So so the picture is of me with my hair a bit of a mess, And I think that's Fiona's head over Dominic Cummings' shoulder. Yeah. I think it is. I'm shaking hands with Ian Duncan Smith, who at the time was the boss of Dominic Cummings. And do you recognize the the building? No. Only because you told me you told me it was a US embassy. It's Wingfield House. It's the American ambassador's residence. It was an Independence Day bash. Dominic Cummings was there with Duncan Smith. And Dominic Cummings basically said, you know, when you have a picture with Ian or IDS or whatever you call them those days. And, yeah, it's a bit of an odd picture, isn't it? So the the story that I got yesterday walking past my house was In the other picture that we've been discussing So hold on a minute. Walking past your house, you got this story? Well, I was yeah. Well, because I was walking well, why is I walking past? It's a bit weird. But, anyway, I was walking the kids, I think, to school, And I stopped by my neighbor, and she's listening to the podcast. And she said her father was an MP. She said that the reason why John Major, Tony Blair, and Patty Auchan were laughing so much is that John Major was explaining that one of his goldfish had got sunburnt and was describing how his brother and he had to remove the 2nd goldfish and Tank and try to coat it in sun cream before putting it back to the tank. I've seen that rings a bell now. I after I mentioned the photo, I did send Tony a WhatsApp message and said with the picture, do you remember what you were laughing about? He said, no idea. John Major was obviously telling a funny story, but he couldn't remember. But did John Major mention that, mate? I I don't know where she where she got it. Put that picture again, but also the one of me and Dominic Cummings and Ian Duncan Smith in the newsletter. The one thing we haven't got a picture of is a picture of me and Governor Schwarzenegger, instead of which we have a picture of the 2 of us sitting in the studio with him slumped in the chair with me looking so much and Larger than him. He looks massive compared to him. Yeah. I know. But I I wanted a photograph with the governor. But Well, that was a picture with the governor. You wanted a classic handshade. Yeah. I don't know an arm wrestle Like you in? I think the arm wrestle you you yeah. I think you might have lost. I mean, bench pressing 560 pounds, so I think you might have you on that one. Quite interesting how many conservative leaders Dominic Cummings has had considerable contempt for. It is. No. I suspect he's got contempt for all of his So you could say Ian Duncan Smith's the one who he said was Thick as a Thick as a plank? Thick as a Thick as Thick as Thick as Thick as mince. Was he thick as mince, or was that David Davis? I think David Davis might have been thick as mince. He's certainly I've never heard Dominic Cummings say a flattering word about it. I wonder what he thinks about you. So he actually did, He said recently, you said something sensible. Yeah. He said, I don't really agree with Royan very much, but Some of the stuff that he'd said recently about oh, I think I was grumbling about civil service, which obviously he likes. I know. He loves doing that. Yeah. So here's a question from Tom Hooper. Now Tom Hooper, if it's the same Tom Hooper, is a great film director, film producer. His question is, whose job is it in government to think about and plan for the long term, 10, 20, 50 years ahead. How can the system be improved to help the government think further ahead and ensure that we are prepared and resilient for what is predicted or unknown? Now that's a really big important question. Mhmm. Tomache also we talked about King's Speech. I think he directed that film which they called The King's Speech about how George the 6th Learn to overcome a stuttering. With, with Colin Firth. Colin Firth. Yeah. So 10, 20, 50 years, I mean, it's something the Chinese obviously really pride themselves on, Being able to think in these much longer time frames. The monarchies in the Middle East, very proud of being able to think in much longer time frames. Well, I think China is a very good example, isn't it? And they they have their owners have 5 year and they do have kind of 10 year, 20, 50 year plans. But, of course, they're not democracies. This is a related question from Lloyd. It'd be really interesting to hear your thoughts on the well-being of future to generations act in Wales, which is doing politics differently by making politicians focus on social environmental issues over short termism and quick wins. This is a whole different way of doing government. The answer to Tom's question, I guess there is nobody with that responsibility in government. It would be the prime minister if the prime minister decided that was a thing to do. Mhmm. That'll be something the cabinet office would probably have to do all sorts of different things. Yeah. Exactly. Most of those long term challenges would be cross cutting. It wouldn't just be sort of, you know, for 1 department. Look. There was a period of our term in office when Tony was very, very focused on this thing about, you know, 10 year plans for all the big public services. And that even 10 years felt within the context of running a government felt like a long time. That is a very, very good question. Maybe when we do our chat GPT, TikTok's manifesto. We should feed that 1 in. Very good. Have a long term thinking, czar. Final one for you from the world of Lard. Extraordinary name. The world of lard. I appreciate this might be seen as a hot take, but are our MPs and ministers paid enough compared to people with similar responsibilities in the private sector? Would we attract more higher quality candidates if the rewards were greater? So to put it in context, when I was the secretary of state for international development, I had a budget of 13,000,000,000, so Â£13,000,000 a year to spend, and I guess we were paid just over Â£100,000 a year. Not bad. Do Do you think people should be paid more than that? Well, one of the best governments in the world is reckoned to be the Singapore government, where the average salary for ministers to cabinet is about $1,000,000, and then go out and get the best people and put them in there. I think politicians probably should be paid more simply because I think, done well, it's a very, very difficult and very, very important job. I think the problem at the moment is not many of them are doing it that well. Look. I'm sure you didn't go into politics to get rich. I am I'm sure I'm not alone in that when I jumped from media to politics, I took a very, very large pay cut. But I I do think that One of the reasons why the gene pool has narrowed so much is that a lot of really bright people, smart people, you know, they realize that they can actually Make a lot of money doing different things. The other worry I have is that we make politics yet again as it was in the olden days, something that only people of independent wealth Or say can actually do. Yeah. Either people like Jeremy Corbyn who have this very ascetic kind of view of the world or People like a lot of the conservative front bench who are people who've made money before they've gone into politics. When when we true in the US. I mean, their senators are almost all millionaires. And also because they have to raise so much money to fight campaigns, which and then if you don't have access to money, it's quite hard to to raise it. But equally, I think it would be Totally electorally or feel electorally very afraid of Absolutely not. I mean, so Kistammer is not gonna suggest that MPs should be paid more, Let's not pay nurses more, but let's pay MPs more. That is not gonna help anybody. But, yeah, when we were coming out from Britport, we were talking to somebody who said that as you go out through this town, You'll drive past the wall of Richard Drax's estate. So so he's he's extraordinary. He was A TV news presenter, very good looking, he was an an army officer, comes from this, extraordinary parliamentary family where one of his ancestors, And he's got a quadruple barreled name that I'm not going to attempt, but it's got Earl and Earnly and Plunkett and Drax in various different Directions. But he had an ancestor who was in the House of Commons in the late 19th century, direct ancestor, who, I think, didn't speak for something like 20 years And then eventually got to his feet, and everyone was incredibly excited that Drax was about to speak. And he said, mister speaker, it's a bit hot. Do you think somebody could open the window and then sat down and didn't speak again for his 40 year parliamentary career? Well, Richard Drakes, MP, MP for South Dorset, which is where we were, his name is Richard Grosvenor Plunkett Ernie Earl Drax. Very good. Yeah. And why is he so wealthy, though? Well, you did right back to the slave trade. Slave trade. Yeah. So I think in the interests of context, I think the Drax family would acknowledge They made a lot of money in the 18th, early 19th century from their plantations in Barbados, which were dependent entirely on slavery, But they also are descended from many other aristocratic, subarastocratic landed families in Britain going back to the Middle Ages and had huge land. I mean, he's Very unusual because you don't wanna give the impression that the modern conservative party is dominated by these people. He's one of these things who literally is like A figment out of the 18th, early 19th century still somehow sitting in the British Parliament. So, anyway, the wall is like you drive past of ages. And every few 100 yards, there's a sort of vast statue of an animal, a stag or a lion or something. So So what I don't want is a House of Commons full of Yep. Slave trading Tories Yeah. Descendants. He's not himself. I think a few So it should work because it's really good. Not themselves plus etcetera. Yeah. No. But I I agree. And it's, I think it's very unfortunate, but the only way of addressing it is if Some politician has the courage to think about increasing salaries, which I think is very, very difficult to do. Meanwhile, people will feel that they can earn much more money, have much Less abuse, much less stress. Yeah. See more of their families doing something else. He's, according to I'm now looking at Dorset live. He's number 3 on the Dorset Rich list. And as of December 2020, according to The Guardian, he was worth Â£150,000,000. Yes. Well, I mean, it's it's one of these very, very grand sort of subaristocratic landed families that have been owning Dorset for 300 years. Quite interesting looking at, and he's he's not the person I thought he was. One of his ancestors in the 19th century was particularly sort of evil and cruel and put an enormous amount of the family money into building an enormous mausoleum, like a sort of pharaonic pyramid to himself.

What could they possibly achieve there, and is this their role? What did you make of it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think Their visits will be welcomed by the Israeli government. I mean, I think the Israeli government made a great deal of their visits because they saw it\n\nSpeaker 0: Did they?\n\nSpeaker 1: Sign of solidarity. And they they there were a lot of photographs Put out some not the kind of newspapers you'd read, but The Telegraph, for example. Page 3 had sort of half the page showing Boris Johnson walking through Jerusalem looking, you know, anxious with Israeli ministers with him. But I think it's something that Israel is looking for big public symbols of solidarity, He sure enough, he came out and gave a very strong, very steady statement. So I think it's it's largely symbolic.\n\nWhat did you make of what he's up to?\n\nSpeaker 0: I was slightly It turned off here when I saw that they he did a, quote, exclusive interview with GB News.\n\nSpeaker 1: With which he's just got a just got a job at.\n\nSpeaker 0: He's a new employer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I noticed the Telegraph, although it carried the photograph, I heard very little about him because I imagine they're a bit irritated that this person who they used to pay Â£250,000 a year to is now GB News and a column in the mail. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I just find, Johnson and and Morrison to a lesser extent, but they're they both, to me, are just the symbols of the the populism that we should be getting rid of and not giving them that much of a platform. So I form. So I don't know. I must tell you, by the way, I I spoke at the Mansion House the other night at a a dinner, and the catering was provided by The Clink.\n\nYou know, The Clink Charity?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. We have wonderful charity.\n\nSpeaker 0: Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Starts in Brixton, so quick and remind people about Clink if you wanna support it. So love the idea, and the idea is to train prisoners up in different Bits of Catering, they run a prison, they run a restaurant in Brixton Prison called the Clink where you can go and eat. But also when The program leaves the prison. They're often met at the gate. They're helped into a job.\n\nThey have catering companies who help employ them.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, they do City and Guilds while they're there. So the the the dinner that we had at the Mansion House, the catering was done by guys on day release.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Anyway, what it meant was that I was able to start my speech by getting able to thank the caterers and say that by the time we get to our comfortable beds, so the chef who's just cooked us that wonderful meal We'll be back in his cell in Brixton. And wouldn't it be marvelous if in a year's time, the same function was performed by Dovidic Coveys and Boris Johnson? Ah. And it went there very, very well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I got told off, actually. I gave a speech at Saint Martin's in the Fields and, got slightly told off for referring to Boris Johnson to my speech. Somebody said to me, your your speech would be more powerful if you hinted that that's who you're referring to, but that you discredit yourself by\n\nSpeaker 0: signing up. Unless something dramatic happens to him in the next month. Shall we not mention him for at least a month?\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Excellent. That's very good. Okay. Excellent.\n\nFrom Russ Macnaughton, what do you make of the idea that Robert Malley was steering the US towards allowing Iran to be a more dominant power in the Middle East? So This is a real inside Washington baseball story, I would have thought, for 99% of listeners. Rob Malley is somebody that I know a little. He was an American diplomat. He was the special envoy for Iran.\n\nHe played a very important part in Obama's, negotiations around the nuclear deterrent. He ran the international crisis group as a predecessor to Comfort Hero, who we are about to interview on leading. And Rob has been suspended, and there's not much clarity around why he was suspended. And it appears to be Suggestions going around that he'd mishandle classified documents, but at the heart of it all seems to be a disagreement within the administration around the way that Rob and various people that Rob was Working with were reaching out to Iran and dealing with the Iranian media and with Iranian expatriate groups. But fascinated that this is a story that Rusman Northland's got his things around.\n\nAnd it is interesting because Rob Malley was one of the most trusted central parts of the Biden team, and it's very interesting that he's been Senate.\n\nSpeaker 0: Are you are you hinting there that he was possibly thought of getting too close to the Iranians?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That seems to be the implication. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because one of the one of the things I've been reading, I can't remember. I was reading about this, but it was where Netanyahu, in the Israeli context, celebrating what he saw as the demise of the Arabists in the foreign office. You with the foreign office tradition is missing\n\nSpeaker 1: from the very start\n\nSpeaker 0: of the\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. I'm just broken your rule, but I do remember when I'd just become the minister Just stay in the foreign office\n\nSpeaker 0: at the Boris Johnson Whiskey Park. The rule for a secretary. 3 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. But it it relates to it because it I it's always struck with me. Boris Johnson advised me to breakfast In the traveler's club just around the corner from where he was living, in Carlton Terrace, which is a foreign secretary's house. And he turned up late with his bodyguards, and there was no real breakfast available. But What he did was rant at me about Arabists in the foreign office, and the implication was very strongly, you're an Arabist, Rory.\n\nYou're part of this Arabist thing, and I'm gonna make a speech. And he was essentially suggesting to be over breakfast that he was gonna make a very punchy speech about Islam, Arabs, terrorism, calling out the Arabists, making the case for Israel. So this thing about the Arabists Mhmm. Which goes all the way back to Lawrence of Arabia And was at the heart of the problems, the British mandate in Palestine when Britain was trying to balance very, very successfully Jewish and Arab movements within Palestine during the thirties and forties. But the accusation was always that the British Arabists We're too much on the side of the Arabs and not sufficiently press ready, and it was interesting to hear Boris Johnson leaning into that quite as hard.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that and and I think there's something in it. I can recall To one of the during one of the kind of big crises in the Middle East when we were in power, I can't remember the guy's name, but there was somebody there from the foreign office that was I mean, you couldn't get him to say anything really positive about Israel or indeed about the United States in relation to their handling of this issue. So there was maybe something in that, but but it was interesting that Netanyahu saw that as a significant thing, that the foreign officers he saw it was\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's been incredibly traumatic because by the time and this was partly on the new labor, actually, that you broke the link between, the language training, The area of expertise and the ambassadorial jobs. So by 2010, 12 out of the 15 ambassadors in the Middle East couldn't speak Arabic, Whereas a generation before, they had all been through Arabic language training often in in a language school in in Lebanon. And The far off has really prided itself on people who spoke really beautiful Fusil. The the last, legacy of this is someone we've spoken about for who who you appointed was Gerard Russell, On access there. Very excellent man who does speak very beautiful Arabic, but there definitely was a period where that was broken.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think I think you can get through this one without mentioning Boris Johnson because you've now you you you have 1 mark against your name, and we've got a month to go now. Katrina Riddell, the COVID inquiry has raised massive issues about the roles of civil servants and special advisers. But what exactly is the difference between the 2, and who do and who should politicians actually listen to.\n\nSpeaker 1: The difference is that civil servants sit the civil service selection board, join, and serve a full professional career, Traditionally, a 40 years ending up with an index linked pension, and they remain regardless of which government comes in and which government goes out, and they work their way up. Then she become directors, director generals, permanent secretaries. And that's really 99.9% of the government are these professional civil servants. But sitting At the central government are this very small collection of people of whom the members of parliament who become ministers are one lot, and the other lot are these special advisers who are appointed by the ministers by whichever political party happens to be in power. There will be a number of them in number 10, and then each Minister will have 1, 2, or 3 of these people.\n\nUsually, somebody focusing on press and somebody focusing on the more political side. And People who enjoy, yes, minister or yes, prime minister, there's already the beginnings of one of these figures who pops around the corner. Anyway, give us your sense on the difference between the 2 and how you see the the use of the special adviser and how you think about them.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the significance has grown probably. I was a special adviser, and I was appointed by Tony Blair. And the big difference\n\nSpeaker 1: And and you came in from the outside. You had been a civil servant all your life.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. No. No. Jonathan Powell had been a civil servant.\n\nMost of the special advisers were from different sorts of out grounds. We had a I can't remember how many we had in total. You know, it wasn't hundreds. It was in double figures, but it wasn't hundreds. Gordon had quite a few in the treasury.\n\nI think we're limited to most ministers\n\nSpeaker 1: Ed Balls was 1.\n\nSpeaker 0: Ed Balls, Ed Miliband, was the other.\n\nSpeaker 1: Often their roots to becoming MPs. George Osborne, David Cameron was specialized, Matt Hancock\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, if I go through some of ours, Andrew Adonis went to the House of Lords. Pat McFadden, hopefully in the next cabinet. James Purnell, who went into the cabinet. David Miliband. So a lot of them did go that route, but the big difference is that we, in a sense, were allowed to be political.\n\nNow I wasn't allowed to represent the prime minister in a political capacity. I couldn't go and do a number 10 briefing and start, you know, slanging off the opposition, but we were allowed to give political advice as well as, as it were, policy advice. I think that's the big difference. And I think that the politicians, it depends on the politicians, I think they probably do listen more to special advisers, in that the special adviser is probably in their ear more. The special adviser is probably likely to be at all the meetings, whereas a civil servant would dip in and out according to what it was that was being discussed.\n\nBut I there were some ministers who actually if their relations with the civil reserves are very, very good, the special adviser might play a secondary role. But I think in most cases I don't know what it was like when you were in government, But I think in most cases, the special adviser was probably the one that the minister listened to most.\n\nSpeaker 1: What I noticed is that it can be tricky because often the special advisers are very Young, bright, but not often deep specialists in the particular area they're working on. And so I remember as a backbencher Being pretty frustrated with the special advisers in defense, the foreign office, DFID, talking about things like Afghanistan because they were, You know, bright people in their late twenties.\n\nSpeaker 0: And they've probably been somewhere else 5 minutes earlier Exactly. Because their ministry just moved in.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yet you're absolutely right. Often the minister listened to them very carefully, and they Really processed the papers for the minister and whispered in the minister's ear. There's a tradition in the conservative party also that, frustrated me. People like Priti Patel would do it of bringing in special advisers from things like the Taxpayers' Alliance, which is a sort of Tufton Street\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Setup. So when I was in DFID, she brought in a special adviser who was Very much there to make the radical case against aid, the sort of, so I think people can use their special advisers as sort of disruptors ticket\n\nSpeaker 0: to challenge the sources. Now there's a question here from somebody called Matthew Taylor. I don't know if that is Matthew Taylor who was a special adviser. I suspect he's not. What are your views on how to better support the mental health of politicians given the significant abuse they often face, and how can we break down these barriers to encourage and for more young people to get involved in seeking elected office.\n\nI was very interested in the, you read one of the adverts recently for BetterHelp, And I was interested that you said that you'd been getting therapy for the 1st time. Isn't that something you'd have benefited from when you were actually an active politician?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Probably. I mean, I think I definitely benefit from it.\n\nSpeaker 0: What made you decide to do it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that I was feeling very unsettled, and partly trying to process my experience as a politician. I mean, I think my book, politics on the edge, says he plugging it again, is largely about trying to describe why it is such A bizarre, horrifying, strange environment.\n\nSpeaker 0: Did you find the this is my motto, Think and Ink. Did you find that writing the book itself helped?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Really helped. Really helped me clarify and really dig into why I found it such an odd profession. I mean, I was thinking about this last night. Somebody was Trying to say to me, what's wrong with it?\n\nAnd the the example I came up with was Liz Truss that I remember arriving as the environment minister. I'd been in the job for a few hours, And I thought, this is unbelievable. It's so wonderful. I'm now the environment minister, and this is my chance to really make a difference, to Plants another 300,000,000 trees to clean up our ad, clean up our beaches and water. What a privilege.\n\nAnd this trust came to see me and said, Rory, I want you to produce a 10 point plan on the national park. And I thought, that's fantastic. I'm the national parks minister. Okay? So I said secretary said, great.\n\nI'll get Chief executive's national parks then will spend a few weeks working on this, and I'll be able to come up with a vision for the next 20 years, a national parks, United Kingdom. You imagine how wonderful that And she said, no. No. No. I I want it by Thursday evening.\n\nIt was Tuesday. And I said, what what are you talking about? And she said, come on, Rory. How difficult can it be? I can tell you.\n\nYou know? Number 1, get young people into nature. Number 2, clean Clean up the national parks. I don't know. We're gonna get 7 together.\n\nAnd sure enough, Debbie Telegraph, Friday morning, Liz Truss's seven point plan for the national parks.\n\nSpeaker 0: So that's probably a classic example of Liz Truss if she needs something. And they said to her special adviser, I'm having lunch at the Telegraph. I want to give them a story. What would it be? Classic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And she then didn't think about national parks Ever again, I didn't think she ever visited the National Park. And and I thought, so odd. I mean, this is part of the sickness, the whole thing, that that she wouldn't feel. What an amazing opportunity to really think hard about national parks.\n\nSpeaker 0: And what about this question about supporting mental the support of the mental health politicians? I I had Several MPs, not all Labour, but mainly Labour, several MPs who contacted me before the last election saying that they Couldn't face the campaign, and they were thinking of jacking it in or what advice did I have to get them through psychologically, etcetera. And I didn't realize, having worked there for so many years, I didn't realize there actually is a psychological support network within parliament. But so many of the MPs don't want to use it because they're worried about the stigma attached to it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think the stigma's going down a bit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah. It's going down a lot. It's good about that.\n\nSpeaker 1: But but it remains the most poisonous work environment. I mean, we'll we'll see more about this, but there's some horrifying revelations about the Conservative Party now Coming out where it looks as though the party may have been paying victims who were raped by a serving MP and that this is all being covered up. I mean, it's so Horrible. The combination of lack of seriousness, genuine kind of bullying and brutality running from the former speaker right the way through the backbenchers, The the sexless assaults and the there's sexless assaults and allegations. I mean, it it is the most\n\nSpeaker 0: bizarre When when you when you read I don't know if you've read Chris Bryant's book, but when he lists all the kind of personal life scandals that there have been in this parliament. And I think the chapter is called, is this the worst parliament we've ever had? And he he reaches the conclusion that it that it is. And some of these things now, it's almost like they just come and go in a day, and people just move on to the next one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't think there's any environment like it. And, of course, One of the things that we should be thinking about is people talk about it, and they never do anything about it. What would it mean to have some sort of induction process for MPs to try to Share values with them to try to set up standards, to try to provide an some kind of HR system in a light touch way to guide people. And The problem is everybody every MP is a sole trader who thinks they're accountable to their constituents, and they don't really have a boss, which allows them to behave in these Completely horrifying kind of,\n\nSpeaker 0: When I was at, the Dorset, the Britpop Book Festival doing the q and a, there was a question which has been sort of Troubling me ever since, it was a woman who was talking about abuse in social media and so forth. And she actually if I paraphrase her question, she said, you know, how have you managed to go from being a kind of national and international hate figure to something that we all quite like. And I've thought about that a lot because I think I definitely Said to myself, I have to develop a really thick skin, and it has to be real. And developing a thick skin whilst remaining sensitive to things that do matter, sensitive to people, sensitive to opinions, sensitive to the needs of others, which I think you need in in politics. I think it's very, very hard thing to do.\n\nI think a lot of MPs could do with actually thinking about how they do that. I definitely did it by by saying to myself, I am not going to care what most people think about me. I'm going to care about what the people I care about think about me. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I find that's the only way\n\nSpeaker 1: that you're problem, isn't it? Because the the risk is you develop Thick skin, and then you end up lacking empathy for everyone. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I think as long as you care for the people that you care about, you will hopefully have the empathy. Have the empathy. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Alastair, I think we should take a break. Question for you. Jim McGuinn, if Labour win the next election, what are the top 3 things they must do on day 1? Come. Give us Istanbul, give us 2 out of 3.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, day 1, the first thing you have to do is appoint a cabinet and appoint a government. That's the first thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: I day 1 is also when you dropped your independence of Bank of England No.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think it was day 2. Day 2? I think it was day 2. Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty quick.\n\nSpeaker 0: Pretty quick. It might even been I can't it was very, very soon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So you'd kept that up your sleeve to do immediately?\n\nSpeaker 0: I suspect that so let's say Keir Starmer becomes prime minister. He goes outside Downing Street. He makes a speech setting out a sort of the big picture thing. I think I think actually being clear about a strategy for growth has Got to be the first thing. I'm probably indicating that this is a long term plan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Am I right that the Bank of England thing you'd kept secret until that moment and so it was a sort of surprise for people or not? It may have just surprised me, you don't remember it as being kept secret particularly.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I think it was. Right. Yeah. It was.\n\nIt was we talked a lot about, you know, the importance of economic stability. Right. And, you know, we just interviewed Mark Carney on on Leading. It was that's why I was very interested to ask him whether he felt that it was surprising that the country took so long to get an independent bank of England, and he basically said yes. But, no, that was very much Gordon Brown wanting to arrive with a really big moment, and my god, it worked.\n\nPolitically, economically.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's good to Labour define one of those things, although with with they're not gonna reveal it on The rest is politics because they need to keep it secret today too.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think what I think it should be, Rory, is to say, well, look, you know, we've basically got the message from the public. The reason we've been related is people realize that Brexit It's a total dead duck. And,\n\nSpeaker 1: we'll we'll\n\nSpeaker 0: we'll go back in. We're gonna get Oh, we think referendum is so divisive, we won't bother having 1.\n\nSpeaker 1: There we go. That that would really wake people up.\n\nSpeaker 0: Certainly, Ravi. And Bobby is highly unlikely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Excited about that. Tom Huitzinger, does Rory ever get frustrated at Alisa's informality towards guests Stryke, distinguished colleagues, I e, Rory referring to Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor versus Campbell's army.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, shall we what was the person called who asked this question?\n\nSpeaker 1: Tom Huitzinger. Tom Huitzinger? Mister Huitzinger, do you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Mister mister Huitzinger, OBE. I'm going to throw it in a loner for it. What you don't know, Tom, if I may, is that before we started recording, I said to Governor Schwarzenegger, what do we call you? Arnie, Arnold, whatever. And he said, you call me whatever you wanna call me.\n\nBut\n\nSpeaker 1: you you don't think that actually Asking that question, it's very difficult for someone to say, I want you to call me governor.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. But he could have said, well, most people call me governor. Right? But I don't buy this thing about look. I think with American presidents, if if I were to meet Donald Trump right now, I'm not comparing what's left to Trump, There is no way in the world I am calling him mister president.\n\nSpeaker 1: But what do you think what do you think he'd reply if you said to him,\n\nSpeaker 0: what what do\n\nSpeaker 1: you want me to call you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Trump. Yeah. God, Your majesty, your highness. No. I probably am more informal than you.\n\nI never called Tony Blair prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's true.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't I don't I don't I don't know, but I mean, in the job. I didn't go in to say, would you like\n\nSpeaker 1: a cup of tea, prime minister? I actually when I, text Rishi Sunak, I've stopped saying Rishi. I now say prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you? Even along the same Can you show me the last text you sent, and what did you reply?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think he he replied thanks. I think I'd congratulated him on something.\n\nSpeaker 0: Creep. You told me you told me that that you realized whether you become an awful politician was whether you started Congratsulating David Cameron on his speeches.\n\nSpeaker 1: Genuinely he done, which impressed me. Now\n\nSpeaker 0: the AI summit.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't know. I'm not gonna get that Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: You can't just expect me to put my whole life out there.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've had a\n\nSpeaker 0: lot of ideas. Why did you call him governor though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Speaking of that, actually, there was we've got a question on this given what you've just done to me.\n\nSpeaker 0: What?\n\nSpeaker 1: Steve Henderson, given that Westminster and Scottish politicians get away with deleting WhatsApp messages, what's the point of a public inquiry? Should the law be changed to make an offense for a politician to delete messages, or should Alastair have a right to read my little text to Rishi Sunak?\n\nSpeaker 0: He is the prime minister. You are an active political figure even if you're not a politician. You might be influencing decisions for all we know. You're being very secretive about these secret discussions you never told me about. Unless it was, Rishi, you may think we give you a bit of a hard time on this podcast, but we'd like to have you on as a guest.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unless that was your message. That might have been the message. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I think the WhatsApp thing look. We the culture has moved. But I I think that as the culture has moved, if you're in public life now, I think other than for personal family stuff and what have you. I think you gotta be very, very careful about what you say.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of the problems, though, is that you brought in new Labour brought in this Freedom of Information Act, Which means that anything that you say and write down in a formal civil service process is liable to be released So it drove people partly to WhatsApps.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it drove us to Post it notes a lot of the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Post it notes. Yeah. And that is problematic Because actually that's less good for government because it means there's not a proper record of things and not documented in the right way. But some of these allegations actually, Hannah McNamara said That her texts and WhatsApps have been deleted by the civil service. They'd asked for her phone, and they just deleted them.\n\nNicola Sturgeon has deleted all the WhatsApps that she Exchange during the COVID inquiry. But I think the problem is that if you then go after WhatsApps, the politicians will then be driven to even more desperate measures.\n\nSpeaker 0: Look. Tony I think Tony Blair says in his book that he kind of thinks that freedom of information broadly was a mistake. And I I don't think it was a mistake. I think that there should be kind of as much transparency as you can four. But in a serious political culture, which we don't really have, there would be a general understanding that that does mean That there has to be a process where there can be division and disagreement as policy is being developed without every single exchange over a decision being hung out\n\nSpeaker 1: for And and, of course, the problem is that you want to encourage politicians to admit when they don't know things, ask stupid questions, Come up with controversial ideas. And, of course, you freeze all that if there's a risk that that is immediately FOI'd and there's a front page story saying, you know, Rory Stewart asked, where exactly is Cameroon when he was the African minister?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Which actually is not a terrible question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not a terrible question. I didn't know exactly where Cameroon was when I was the African minister, But I wouldn't want that all over the front page. And you see No.\n\nSpeaker 0: You wouldn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now Earl Haig, Alastair, when did you meet Quentin Tarantino and Ian Duncan Smith? And This is an extraordinary photograph apparently in front of what looks like a sort of Christmas tree and a rather nice column. And, actually, it isn't a picture of Quentin Tarantino. It's a picture of Dominic Cummings, Ian Duncan Smith, and a very youthful, smiling Alastair Campbell. And Earl Haig is Presumably the descendant of general Haig.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: He is. Yeah. He's an Earl, isn't he? He's the descendant of Haig who commanded us in the first world.\n\nSpeaker 0: Just be somebody who's called Earl Haig.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. He isn't. No. No.\n\nThere is only 1 Earl Haig. He's a member of the House of Lords. He's descended from the general in the first world war.\n\nSpeaker 0: So so the picture is of me with my hair a bit of a mess, And I think that's Fiona's head over Dominic Cummings' shoulder. Yeah. I think it is. I'm shaking hands with Ian Duncan Smith, who at the time was the boss of Dominic Cummings. And do you recognize the the building?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Only because you told me you told me it was a US embassy.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's Wingfield House. It's the American ambassador's residence. It was an Independence Day bash. Dominic Cummings was there with Duncan Smith. And Dominic Cummings basically said, you know, when you have a picture with Ian or IDS or whatever you call them those days.\n\nAnd, yeah, it's a bit of an odd picture, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: So the the story that I got yesterday walking past my house was In the other picture that we've been discussing So hold on\n\nSpeaker 0: a minute. Walking past your house, you got this story? Well, I\n\nSpeaker 1: was yeah. Well, because I was walking well, why is I walking past? It's a bit weird. But, anyway, I was walking the kids, I think, to school, And I stopped by my neighbor, and she's listening to the podcast. And she said her father was an MP.\n\nShe said that the reason why John Major, Tony Blair, and Patty Auchan were laughing so much is that John Major was explaining that one of his goldfish had got sunburnt and was describing how his brother and he had to remove the 2nd goldfish and Tank and try to coat it in sun cream before putting it back to the tank.\n\nSpeaker 0: I've seen that rings a bell now. I after I mentioned the photo, I did send Tony a WhatsApp message and said with the picture, do you remember what you were laughing about? He said, no idea. John Major was obviously telling a funny story, but he couldn't remember. But did John Major mention that, mate?\n\nSpeaker 1: I I don't know where she where she\n\nSpeaker 0: got it. Put that picture again, but also the one of me and Dominic Cummings and Ian Duncan Smith in the newsletter. The one\n\nSpeaker 1: thing we haven't got a picture of is a picture of me and Governor Schwarzenegger, instead of which we have a picture of the 2 of us sitting in the studio with him slumped in the chair with me looking so much and Larger than him.\n\nSpeaker 0: He looks massive compared to him. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know. But I I wanted a photograph with the governor. But\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that was a picture with the governor. You wanted a classic handshade.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I don't know an arm wrestle Like you in?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the arm wrestle you you yeah. I think you might have lost. I mean, bench pressing 560 pounds, so I think you might have you on that one. Quite interesting how many conservative leaders Dominic Cummings has had considerable contempt for. It is.\n\nNo. I suspect he's got contempt for all of\n\nSpeaker 1: his So you could say Ian Duncan Smith's the one who he said was Thick as a\n\nSpeaker 0: Thick as a plank? Thick as a Thick as Thick as\n\nSpeaker 1: Thick as Thick\n\nSpeaker 0: as mince. Was he thick as mince, or was that David Davis? I think David Davis might have been thick as mince. He's certainly I've never heard Dominic Cummings say a flattering word about it. I wonder what he thinks about you.\n\nSpeaker 1: So he actually did,\n\nSpeaker 0: He said recently, you said something sensible. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: He said, I don't really agree with Royan very much, but Some of the stuff that he'd said recently about oh, I think I was grumbling about civil service, which obviously he likes. I know. He loves doing that. Yeah. So here's a question from Tom Hooper.\n\nNow Tom Hooper, if it's the same Tom Hooper, is a great film director, film producer. His question is, whose job is it in government to think about and plan for the long term, 10, 20, 50 years ahead. How can the system be improved to help the government think further ahead and ensure that we are prepared and resilient for what is predicted or unknown? Now that's a really big important question. Mhmm.\n\nTomache also we talked about King's Speech. I think he directed that film which they called The King's Speech about how George the 6th Learn to overcome a stuttering.\n\nSpeaker 0: With, with Colin Firth. Colin Firth.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So 10, 20, 50 years, I mean, it's something the Chinese obviously really pride themselves on, Being able to think in these much longer time frames. The monarchies in the Middle East, very proud of being able to think in much longer time frames.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think China is a very good example, isn't it? And they they have their owners have 5 year and they do have kind of 10 year, 20, 50 year plans. But, of course, they're not democracies. This is a related question from Lloyd. It'd be really interesting to hear your thoughts on the well-being of future to generations act in Wales, which is doing politics differently by making politicians focus on social environmental issues over short termism and quick wins.\n\nThis is a whole different way of doing government. The answer to Tom's question, I guess there is nobody with that responsibility in government. It would be the prime minister if the prime minister decided that was a thing to do. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: That'll be something the cabinet office would probably\n\nSpeaker 0: have to do all sorts of different things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Most of those long term challenges would be cross cutting. It wouldn't just be sort of, you know, for 1 department. Look. There was a period of our term in office when Tony was very, very focused on this thing about, you know, 10 year plans for all the big public services. And that even 10 years felt within the context of running a government felt like a long time.\n\nThat is a very, very good question. Maybe when we do our chat GPT, TikTok's manifesto. We should feed that 1 in. Very good. Have a long term thinking, czar.\n\nSpeaker 1: Final one for you from the world of Lard. Extraordinary name. The world of lard. I appreciate this might be seen as a hot take, but are our MPs and ministers paid enough compared to people with similar responsibilities in the private sector? Would we attract more higher quality candidates if the rewards were greater?\n\nSo to put it in context, when I was the secretary of state for international development, I had a budget of 13,000,000,000, so Â£13,000,000 a year to spend, and I guess we were paid just over Â£100,000 a year. Not bad. Do Do you think people should be paid more than that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, one of the best governments in the world is reckoned to be the Singapore government, where the average salary for ministers to cabinet is about $1,000,000, and then go out and get the best people and put them in there. I think politicians probably should be paid more simply because I think, done well, it's a very, very difficult and very, very important job. I think the problem at the moment is not many of them are doing it that well. Look. I'm sure you didn't go into politics to get rich.\n\nI am I'm sure I'm not alone in that when I jumped from media to politics, I took a very, very large pay cut. But I I do think that One of the reasons why the gene pool has narrowed so much is that a lot of really bright people, smart people, you know, they realize that they can actually Make a lot of money doing different things. The other worry I have is that we make politics yet again as it was in the olden days, something that only people of independent wealth\n\nSpeaker 1: Or say can actually do. Yeah. Either people like Jeremy Corbyn who have this very ascetic kind of view of the world or People like a lot of the conservative front bench who are people who've made money before they've gone into politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: When when we\n\nSpeaker 1: true in the US. I mean, their senators are almost all millionaires.\n\nSpeaker 0: And also because they have to raise so much money to fight campaigns, which and then if you don't have access to money, it's quite hard to to raise it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But equally, I think it would be Totally electorally or feel electorally very afraid of\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely not. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: so Kistammer is not gonna suggest that MPs should be paid more,\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's not pay nurses more, but let's pay MPs more. That is not gonna help anybody. But, yeah, when we were coming out from Britport, we were talking to somebody who said that as you go out through this town, You'll drive past the wall of Richard Drax's estate.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so he's he's extraordinary. He was A TV news presenter, very good looking, he was an an army officer, comes from this, extraordinary parliamentary family where one of his ancestors, And he's got a quadruple barreled name that I'm not going to attempt, but it's got Earl and Earnly and Plunkett and Drax in various different Directions. But he had an ancestor who was in the House of Commons in the late 19th century, direct ancestor, who, I think, didn't speak for something like 20 years And then eventually got to his feet, and everyone was incredibly excited that Drax was about to speak. And he said, mister speaker, it's a bit hot. Do you think somebody could open the window and then sat down and didn't speak again for his 40 year parliamentary career?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Richard Drakes, MP, MP for South Dorset, which is where we were, his name is Richard Grosvenor Plunkett Ernie Earl Drax.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And why is he so wealthy, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you did right back to the slave trade.\n\nSpeaker 0: Slave trade. Yeah. So I\n\nSpeaker 1: think in the interests of context, I think the Drax family would acknowledge They made a lot of money in the 18th, early 19th century from their plantations in Barbados, which were dependent entirely on slavery, But they also are descended from many other aristocratic, subarastocratic landed families in Britain going back to the Middle Ages and had huge land. I mean, he's Very unusual because you don't wanna give the impression that the modern conservative party is dominated by these people. He's one of these things who literally is like A figment out of the 18th, early 19th century still somehow sitting in the British Parliament.\n\nSpeaker 0: So, anyway, the wall is like you drive past of ages. And every few 100 yards, there's a sort of vast statue of an animal, a stag or a lion or something. So So what I don't want is a House of Commons full of Yep. Slave trading Tories\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Descendants. He's not himself. I think a few\n\nSpeaker 0: So it should work because it's really good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not themselves plus etcetera. Yeah. No. But I I agree. And it's, I think it's very unfortunate, but the only way of addressing it is if Some politician has the courage to think about increasing salaries, which I think is very, very difficult to do.\n\nMeanwhile, people will feel that they can earn much more money, have much Less abuse, much less stress. Yeah. See more of their families doing something else.\n\nSpeaker 0: He's, according to I'm now looking at Dorset live. He's number 3 on the Dorset Rich list. And as of December 2020, according to The Guardian, he was worth Â£150,000,000.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Well, I mean, it's it's one of these very, very grand sort of subaristocratic landed families that have been owning Dorset for 300 years.\n\nSpeaker 0: Quite interesting looking at, and he's he's not the person I thought he was.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of his ancestors in the 19th century was particularly sort of evil and cruel and put an enormous amount of the family money into building an enormous mausoleum, like a sort of pharaonic pyramid to himself.
