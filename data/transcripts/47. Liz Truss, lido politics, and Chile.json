That's the rest is politics.com. Hello, and welcome to the rest of this politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. We're recording this on Tuesday afternoon, the day after our emergency Liz Truss victory part. Today's episode, we'll talk a little bit more about prime minister, cover some stories from abroad too. We're gonna start, though, with obviously the thing that's on every listener's mind, which is, Alastair, did you really go for a swim in the Lido instead of watching Boris Johnson's leaving speech this morning because that's not great preparation for today's podcast. I went to the LILO at 7. I was in the water at 701. I was out of the water at 7:25, and I listened to Boris Johnson on Radio 5 live as I walked home. Is that okay? And that was that was enough for me to, realize that he was he left office exactly as he entered office as a liar and a fantasist, talking about this amazing country that he transformed his whole years there. And without a hint of humility or frustration Any sense that he was anything other than the wonderful figure, who would go down in British history as one of our great leaders, and then off he toddled to Balmoral to resign. And many people will sort of sort of believe that when they had this line that, of course, troubles me a lot, which He says he's he's heading off like Cincinnatus to his plow. And the point about Cincinnatus is since there's a Roman Rempel. Yeah. Exactly. Roman politician sets off his plan to get summoned back to save the country. So And and became a dictator, didn't he? Oh, that's that's I think he was an emergency dictator. Yeah. Well, that's yeah. That's good. It has a good laugh. Classy, wasn't it? There was there was there was it was that was totally thrown out there to have people telling that story. And then if he's asked about it, he'll say, well, no. No. It was just a joke. Just a joke. Whatever. But, no, if I was Liz Truss, of all you know, I'd be I'd be worried about Johnson's intentions. And I think William Hague was right when we talked to him recently when he said Johnson's friend should tell him in no uncertain terms. He should stay out, but he won't. He's incapable of, being anything other than the centre of attention. Speaking of William Hague, good article on The Times today. This points out we've had 6 foreign secretaries in the last 8 years Compared to 6 foreign secretaries in the 24 years before that. Imagine what that means for British foreign policy because diplomacy almost more than anything else relies on these- these relationships. I'm here speaking to you from Uganda where the president has been in- President Museveni has been in for- for decades now And you only really begin to get anywhere with relationships, I think, on at least the 2nd or 3rd visit. And the problem that we've been facing with our foreign secretaries, indeed all our ministers, It's that they rarely make it to the 1st visit, let alone beyond. No. But added to which, we're just not taken as seriously as we were, are we? I mean, the the the country is not taken as seriously. And, look, let's trust I don't know. I mean, has she has she really been effective as a foreign secretary? I mean, she's been effective in terms of persuading the Tory party members that she somehow single handedly stood up of Vladimir Putin. I'm sure it's news to Vladimir Putin, but I don't know. I just I just worry the extent to which we're just not seen as a serious country. And our apologies. You I you know, I I mentioned this guy from I told you from Singapore. He said, we used to look at your politics with jealousy, and now we just So look at it and No. So I I couldn't Sad. Couldn't agree more. And it's been going on, unfortunately, a bit a little bit longer than even the horrible Boris Johnson. I remember my friend John Saying that he'd taken a friend of his from India into the House of Commons to watch a debate and he used to do it in the 19 eighties with enormous pride and he remembers Sitting, this was in my early days under David Cameron, just sitting there and almost kind of weeping with shame at seeing MPs all on their phones, the very poor quality of the debate, very poorly attended chamber on a really big serious foreign policy issue. That's horrible. One small thing that I noticed, she's, as Liz Truss, has said that she wants to create a much smaller, tighter office in Downing Street. And That is also what David Cameron said he was gonna do in 2010 and it went wrong for him because what happened is that he came in. Gordon Brown before him had been running, had inherited, actually, from Tony Blair these delivery units, where number 10 was really quite a machine. It was running a lot of government. And David Cameron thought that he could just undo all that and have much smaller group of special advisers around him. And the truth was that it really didn't work. And in fact, the permanent secretaries who came in were very, very worried about the way things were being run because you can't just remove that And hope that by removing it, you're gonna return to some imagined dream of cabinet government. And I'm very, very worried that What you end up with is very inexperienced, young special advisers who really don't get most of these subjects Trying to bully and boss around other departments, other cabinet ministers. So I I'm I'm troubled by that that Beginning change in the institution of government. But she, but she wants some, she, you know, she's made a big thing during the leadership election about, you know, cutting down the size of the state, and I do think they've got to revisit this whole thing about the way they talk about the public sector and the way they talk about civil servants. It's almost like they are And John Major made that speech a few months ago about the attitude now, we are the masters now. In other words, what we say goes. And if you've got something like Johnson and people say the same about trust that they have very fixed positions, they reach idiosyncratic ideas, and then they want them delivered. The civil they can't do them on their own. Prime prime ministers can't make Policy happen. They they can devise policy, but you need civil servants to implement it. And and add the problem, which is that The civil servants feel cowed and terrified so many, many departments, they're not putting up proper advice to ministers Because they're terrified about putting in writing things that are gonna get them attacked. A very toxic culture has been created Where if ministers don't like what they read, they jump up and down and they say, this is defeatist, this isn't echoing the messages we want. And the next thing you know, a few weeks later, they're saying, well, I don't like this briefing I've received. This is absolutely hopeless. You're not telling me anything. And the civil servant has to say, well, There's a reason why it's hopeless because if I actually wrote down on this bit of paper for the meeting that you're going into, minister, the truth of the ticket. My whole civil service department would go into a panic because the whole thing is terrified by these very erratic extreme views from some of the senior ministers. Do you think you should tell our listeners about the message you got from a a senior diplomat about the foreign office handling of our podcast? To to to be Absolutely clear. This was a message I got sometime ago. So this is not something which, this is not anything where trusting. It's not it's and it's not But it might be because she was the foreign secretary at the time. And it was foreign secretary at the time. That's true. Foreign secretary at the time. But, definitely, it's something I received before the current trip. So this is somebody writing saying, like half the country, I'm a fan of the tonic that is the rest of his politics British diplomat. I thought I had to let you know, entirely unsourceable, of course, that FCDO has blocked the podcast download on official phones On account of explicit content, god forbid we offended the diplomats. Is that because of the rating? Because I think because I occasionally use the f word, we apparently are we've we are put down as the adult material, but it's kind of explicit, I think, is the word. I I didn't you know, I read that message out on our Liz Trust podcast, and something stopped me From reading the name of the person who sent it, and I'm very glad that I did because it turned out that they were a civil servant. So, there's a lot of angry people out there. And I'll tell you the thing I've noticed is I noticed it when I was at the Lido, This is not being seen as a new dawn, is it? I mean, people are just, god. It's right. There's no There's no great love to watch But there are opportunities for a new dawn. I don't think this trust is gonna take them. But but let's just take a moment here Just in in the fantasy world in which Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart have any influence over events at all, here's one one one thought that I had. So So I'm traveling through Africa at the moment. I'm on my way to Kenya. But I have the inauguration. The election's been upheld, so William Ruto is about to be inaugurated as president. I was at the last inauguration, which I think I told you about, where I got knocked at Roe back because a senior well, actually, not very senior Chinese official came in. I was considered much more important than I was. But, I do think the more that I travel around Africa, the more I realize that Britain has an opportunity To lead the world in changing the way it does development assistance, the way it does aid, African countries are completely fed up with the fact that they think of aid as very, very patronising. Most senior African politicians that I meet remember being lectured in the 1960s 70s, Remember the way in which development aid was used to try to humiliate and patronise African nations. They're looking For a new model, what they call a modern partnership. And Is that is that not what the Chinese are doing, though? Well, This is, you're quite right to come to that. And this is where I think we come in. We are right here. Britain and Africa is right at the front line of taking on China and Russia. And the message I put to this trust is whatever you do, do not cut the development aid budget In places like Africa because we have a real opportunity to make a modern partnership which is not the Chinese and Russian partnership, One that differentiates itself and I, of course, would argue that one element of that is trusting Citizens in Africa by doing cash programmes, giving them choice, giving them freedom on how they not, not you and me turning up and telling people how to spend their money, But actually being really radical, setting up the beginnings for welfare state. If you're going to use a second successive main podcast to promote your new job about which we're all very, very happy. I'm going to jump forward and ask you one of the questions that we got this week. And I'm also then going to give you a couple of comments from the showers in the Lido, you'll be pleased to know. Stephen Findlay, if we paid all residents of the village in cash, and they all tried to buy a cow. How do we stop a cattle rancher with a few cows driving up prices? That's the first question. Jim Down, who's a doctor who swims in the lie, though, he he he enjoyed hearing about your job, and he enjoyed and he he he loved your passion and excitement about it. His question was, how do you sustain that? How do you give them a cash payment and then build sustainable prosperity? And Russell Kay, who is also a swimmer, and he's worried that you underestimate the broader economic impact. And he's also worried about how you assess this unless you have the middle people, the assessors that you actually say you want to get rid of by just giving them cash. So there you are. We talk about nothing but your new job as a live incredibly kind. So just for listeners who haven't been keeping up, I've just taken over as the As the president, the the sort of CEO of a a charity called Give Directly. Yeah. Get your title right. Get get it get it right. And, So 3 challenges there. I'm not sure I can deal with all of them in a very short answer. But firstly, on inflation, very, very good research the stuff. There have been over 200 academic papers on cash. And the truth is that if you do stuff in 1 village, it doesn't have a big inflation impact on the country. In fact, the model is that unless you put about 20% of the gross domestic product to the country in as cash, you're unlikely to drive up prices. What will happen is that people will respond. You're right. Somebody from a neighboring village will bring some cows over so they can be bought, but We don't end up with huge inflation in prices. Next next challenge, Sustainability. Yeah. Sustainability. So There it's true that there will always be people in any country who are going to have to continue to receive social security payments, true in Britain, true in the United States, true in Africa. Africa is no different. There will be people who are disabled, elderly, and we have to set up In the end, in countries as they develop something like a welfare state for people who can't look after themselves. But there are many, many people, The majority, in fact, is the people who are currently living in extreme poverty, who are young, who are entrepreneurial, very, very young populations in Africa, for whom a lump sum cash payment gives them that opportunity to set up a business, to start trading. And it's remarkable, The data, been fantastic studies on this from Bangladeshi to Africa, that pretty soon people end up with very significant savings, investments, income because what's holding them back fundamentally? There must be some who just go and blow it. There must be. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. There are definitely people who who go and blow it as there are in our own country. But but it but it's true that and, well, it's Human beings, you're giving money to human beings, but generally speaking, if you're one of the very, very extreme poor, you're not that likely to blow it because You really understand much more than you or I do the value of money because every single dollar means to them what 100 or $500 would mean to us. Well, Stephen Findlay can let us know whether he thought you answered the first part, and I will report back from Jim and Russell in the showers where we have these very elevated conversations. These conversations to the showers. So I also love this sort of vision of your morning. So you you wake up in the morning at 6:30 in the morning. Is that right? And then you go for a swim in an outdoor pool. Is it heat tip? With Fiona, no. It's not heat. In fact, it's too warm at the moment. It's too muddy. We like it really, really cold. Do so do you go in the middle of winter? Are you like one of these kind of polar bear types? Yeah. Through the winter. The the colder, the better. And that's it's And and then to to get your blood pressure going, you then listen to Boris Johnson's resignation speech on your way home? Not not not every day. I mean, thank thank thankfully, there's only been the one resignation each. His brother's actually his brother Joe is actually an an irregular swimmer at the Lido. So we occasionally Have polite conversations about politics. What about the where where where so what about this, tell we talked a little bit about quasi quarteng. What What about James Clevely? What do you know about James Clevely? James Clevely, he was one of Boris Johnson's, my my memory of him I hope I'm getting this right, being unfair to James, I think he was one of Boris Johnson's lieutenants when Boris Johnson was mayor of London, served as deputy mayor for a bit. He, like me did a short course at Sandhurst, very short course at Sandhurst and then I think was in the Territorial Army. He's interesting. I mean, so from, I guess, I think he talks a lot about his background. It's quite an interesting background. 1 black parent, 1 white parent. He, very, very proud of his military service. I mean, I like James, actually. I'm I'm sort of skirting around the edges of this. I wanted to tempt him to be my running mate when I ran for the leadership in 2019, and he quite sensibly threw in his lot with Boris Johnson, wouldn't have anything to do with me. Notwithstanding that slight grumble I have against him, the reason I did it is that he's actually, he's good at being funny. He talks normal better than most MPs. He's quite quick on Twitter and he's a grown up. I mean, he's somebody who you could take into a meeting with A senior foreign, for sure. And he'll be polite. He'll listen. He'll be thoughtful. Is he clever? No. I don't think he's I don't think he'd he'd say that his big thing is Is is that I think what he is is a he's a sensible, thoughtful person. I think he's somebody who Do you do you have think that foreign secretaries, particularly in the world that you Be fine. Do you think they need to be really clever? I really like clever foreign You like really clever foreign secretaries, do you? Who who's who's your favorite foreign secretaries? Ice I mean, I do think Robin Cook could be very, very tricky, but he was incredibly clever and smart, both politically and intellectually. I used to love Hans Dietrich Genscher. Do you remember with the yellow jump, please? Yeah. And then there was this tradition of very grand conservative foreign secretaries, wasn't it, going From Lord Carrington through to Douglas Heard? Douglas Heard. Yep. Doug I think Douglas Heard was clever. He well, of course, he was head by at Eton, Top story. My god. Oh, listen. We've done the diplomat. Shall we tell our listeners about about our other very distinguished listener who sent your message? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Let you I will let you do the content of the said distinguished listener's message, and I will not say anything. I will let you present it at face value. And I actually thought he made quite a good case for himself. Well, I I thought it was very, very brave. So the head head head pastor of Eton That's written in. As you anyone who's not been following this too I've had obviously, anyone who listens to this knows that all that Alastair does is grumble about you all the time. No. It's not all that I do. I do a lot of things. So he says, he says continuing, he's a very good, you're very, he's very game, the headmaster Sweden, continuing to love the podcast. New role sounds fascinating. I heard your q and a on Thursday. The stuff that Ethan's sending you a few bits and pieces to give you some more Ethan partnership info and And a copy of our recent inspection report. I think you should have the color that he listened to the last episode of the podcast driving to Middlesbrough. I thought that was quite interesting. He was driving to Middlesbrough. That's good. So they're supporting new 6 forms, and they're bidding under the government's free school programme. They're gonna add Significant top up funding, £1,000,000 per school per year in perpetuity to the government funding, Schools yet to be approved, and then there was some quite quite nice articles. So Ian Ian Austin, Labour MP, who I guess you know. You know Ian Austin. Right? Ex Labour MP now appear appointed by Johnson, I think. But there was some there were some Labour council leaders who were giving their very positive Yep. Simon Henderson, who's the Hermos' Reardon, is levelling up education in the north by helping young people in deprived areas get into the best universities and the headline was Eton's woke headmaster deserves praise, not criticism. So, and actually I think it's a sort of maybe an attack on me, I don't know. He says Rather than briefing against, the headmaster says, old Etonian detractors would do better to focus on all he's doing. Yeah. So I I just think I should let that, I will doubtless come back to say all sorts of things about Eton, but I I think fair play to the headmaster of Eton for listening to the podcast as he drives to one of these schools in a working class area of the north. Fair play to the headmaster of Eton for challenging me, for not being fair, and fair play for setting out What he's doing. I still think that Eton and Oxbridge are two of the reasons why this country is such a mess. But anyway But but didn't didn't didn't you go to Oxbridge, Alistair? I did. I did. I and that's that's why I can say as as an insider that I'm not persuaded that it does, all the good that claims. And that's all all that amazing French and German we keep getting on the show. It's partly partly due partly due to that Oxford education. It may be time for a break. And welcome back to The Rest is Politics, with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Tell us a bit about Chile, Biden, Trump. Any thoughts on what's happening internationally? Yeah. Well, first of all, before I I just wanna thank everybody who I got a lot of very, very nice message from our listeners last week about me talking about my depressive episode, which has sort of lingered all week, and I've it's rumbled on and off. But I just wanted to say we got some I know you did as well. We got some amazing, people sharing their stories, people getting hope and solidarity, so I really wanna say thank you for that. Chile was extraordinary this week. Absolutely extraordinary. If you think about it, there were there was trouble in the streets. There was there was real violence going on and because there were massive calls for constitutional change. Okay? And so Gabriel Borics, this young 36 now guy comes along Who who we've all we spoke about. Just to remind readers that Gabriel Borics is this Amazing. The listeners the people listen to podcasts. Right? They read books and newspapers and magazines. Listen. It's kind of a classic kind of Sort of out of central casting student revolutionary, kind of big beard, casual clothes, became leader of his country at the age of 36, one of the youngest leaders in the entire world came in on the back of introducing a radical left wing populist constitution and then over to Alastair for the denouement of the story. Well, it comes along, and and it read and it was it was done through a, a 155 member consultative assembly of non kind of traditional political people. They came up with these mainly political newcomers. They came up with these Very, very, very far wide ranging and pretty radical proposals across social rights, environmental rights, gender equality, parity in government, Access to abortion, gay rights, plurinationalism, recognizing the indigenous communities in Chile, access to education, health, clean water, animal rights. It was a huge thing. And I get I fear it's one of those things where They just got carried away and put too much in, and they gave too much for their opponents to to go at. And he ended they they ended up losing by 61.9 to 38 point 1, which is pretty crushing. They're going to go back. They're going to do they they're going to ask them to to redo it and have another go. Because if they don't, they've still got Pinochet's constitution. The the whole thing is completely mad, isn't it? But it's also compulsory voting, so everybody it's not like Brexit where people have a A debate about what the majority of people thought. It's everybody voted and crushing 62% of people vote against, Which is really confusing for the new president. So he's elected on a manifesto if we're gonna bring change. It's also a real reminder of why one doesn't want to do referendums. Remember, we were Talking about this in relation to Colombia, where again, celebrity, you know, great Nobel Peace Prize winning president comes in, does this peace deal, Presents the referendum on the PCL to the people, and it's rejected. But they they had a referendum in 2020 on whether there should be a new constitution, And it passed by 80%. So so they won that one, then he won an election, and then he comes in, and they'd be So you trans but it was the other thing that was amazing this is why I think that, you know, we we when when people hear our interview with Mark Drakeford and we talk about the The importance of some of these constitutional questions, to see those massive crowds, really huge crowds out on the streets of Chile Campaigning one way or the other on these big constitutional questions. I actually found it incredibly exciting. And I and I and I think they'll come I I think they will come back with something. Now I think Biden Trump's worth mentioning just because of, I think, Biden's speech about you know, they they both basically made speeches last week saying that this We're now fighting for the soul of America, and it it sort of does feel like that. And I thought it was very interesting that Biden, I think for the first time, went very, very directly for Donald Trump as the cause of this absolute polarization. And, you know, they obviously fear the for the future of American democracy. It's Big moment. It's pretty pretty serious stuff, isn't it? Pretty serious stuff. Well, thank you guys very, very much. A bit of a short episode, today because we've been doing an enormous number of different different things. And We can't we can't leave without plugging Blackpool, Roy. And I've got an idea. I've got an idea. Yep. So this just to remind you, Winter Gardens Blackpool, huge, biggest venue, Alastair and I have ever played, Saturday, 8th October. Might be the biggest you ever played. I have actually You play big and royalty? I've done I've done the Albert Hall. Oh, you've done that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Saturday 8th October, 8 PM. I think we've we've pretty much sold out the bottom bit, But we've now gotta go up to the top bit. But what my idea was, Blackpool Illuminations. I mean, I know we've got an energy crisis, but apparently the Blackpool Illuminations are on, And they're free. So people should go to Blackpool to see the eliminations for free and then come and pay to see us. What a great idea that is. Actually, Blackpool is a very, very great place to visit. If you've not visited Blackpool, you must visit Blackpool as well as come in to hear the 2 of us. At the Winter Gardens, which you could Google to get access to the tickets that we made, because they're going very, very fast. Alright. Well, thank you everybody very much. See some of you at Black Paul, and thank you, Alastair. Thank you. See you again soon.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello, and welcome to the rest of this politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're recording this on Tuesday afternoon, the day after our emergency Liz Truss victory part. Today's episode, we'll talk a little bit more about prime minister, cover some stories from abroad too. We're gonna start, though, with obviously the thing that's on every listener's mind, which is, Alastair, did you really go for a swim in the Lido instead of watching Boris Johnson's leaving speech this morning because that's not great preparation for today's podcast.\n\nSpeaker 0: I went to the LILO at 7. I was in the water at 701. I was out of the water at 7:25, and I listened to Boris Johnson on Radio 5 live as I walked home. Is that okay? And that was that was enough for me to, realize that he was he left office exactly as he entered office as a liar and a fantasist, talking about this amazing country that he transformed his whole years there.\n\nAnd without a hint of humility or frustration Any sense that he was anything other than the wonderful figure, who would go down in British history as one of our great leaders, and then off he toddled to Balmoral to resign.\n\nSpeaker 1: And many people will sort of sort of believe that when they had this line that, of course, troubles me a lot, which He says he's he's heading off like Cincinnatus to his plow. And the point about Cincinnatus is since there's a Roman Rempel. Yeah. Exactly. Roman politician sets off his plan to get summoned back to save the country.\n\nSpeaker 0: So And and became a dictator, didn't he?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's that's I think he was an emergency dictator. Yeah. Well, that's yeah. That's good. It has a good laugh.\n\nSpeaker 0: Classy, wasn't it? There was there was there was it was that was totally thrown out there to have people telling that story. And then if he's asked about it, he'll say, well, no. No. It was just a joke.\n\nJust a joke. Whatever. But, no, if I was Liz Truss, of all you know, I'd be I'd be worried about Johnson's intentions. And I think William Hague was right when we talked to him recently when he said Johnson's friend should tell him in no uncertain terms. He should stay out, but he won't.\n\nHe's incapable of, being anything other than the centre of attention.\n\nSpeaker 1: Speaking of William Hague, good article on The Times today. This points out we've had 6 foreign secretaries in the last 8 years Compared to 6 foreign secretaries in the 24 years before that. Imagine what that means for British foreign policy because diplomacy almost more than anything else relies on these- these relationships. I'm here speaking to you from Uganda where the president has been in- President Museveni has been in for- for decades now And you only really begin to get anywhere with relationships, I think, on at least the 2nd or 3rd visit. And the problem that we've been facing with our foreign secretaries, indeed all our ministers, It's that they rarely make it to the 1st visit, let alone beyond.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. But added to which, we're just not taken as seriously as we were, are we? I mean, the the the country is not taken as seriously. And, look, let's trust I don't know. I mean, has she has she really been effective as a foreign secretary?\n\nI mean, she's been effective in terms of persuading the Tory party members that she somehow single handedly stood up of Vladimir Putin. I'm sure it's news to Vladimir Putin, but I don't know. I just I just worry the extent to which we're just not seen as a serious country. And our apologies. You I you know, I I mentioned this guy from I told you from Singapore.\n\nHe said, we used to look at your politics with jealousy, and now we just So look at it and No.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I I couldn't Sad. Couldn't agree more. And it's been going on, unfortunately, a bit a little bit longer than even the horrible Boris Johnson. I remember my friend John Saying that he'd taken a friend of his from India into the House of Commons to watch a debate and he used to do it in the 19 eighties with enormous pride and he remembers Sitting, this was in my early days under David Cameron, just sitting there and almost kind of weeping with shame at seeing MPs all on their phones, the very poor quality of the debate, very poorly attended chamber on a really big serious foreign policy issue. That's horrible.\n\nOne small thing that I noticed, she's, as Liz Truss, has said that she wants to create a much smaller, tighter office in Downing Street. And That is also what David Cameron said he was gonna do in 2010 and it went wrong for him because what happened is that he came in. Gordon Brown before him had been running, had inherited, actually, from Tony Blair these delivery units, where number 10 was really quite a machine. It was running a lot of government. And David Cameron thought that he could just undo all that and have much smaller group of special advisers around him.\n\nAnd the truth was that it really didn't work. And in fact, the permanent secretaries who came in were very, very worried about the way things were being run because you can't just remove that And hope that by removing it, you're gonna return to some imagined dream of cabinet government. And I'm very, very worried that What you end up with is very inexperienced, young special advisers who really don't get most of these subjects Trying to bully and boss around other departments, other cabinet ministers. So I I'm I'm troubled by that that Beginning change in the institution of government.\n\nSpeaker 0: But she, but she wants some, she, you know, she's made a big thing during the leadership election about, you know, cutting down the size of the state, and I do think they've got to revisit this whole thing about the way they talk about the public sector and the way they talk about civil servants. It's almost like they are And John Major made that speech a few months ago about the attitude now, we are the masters now. In other words, what we say goes. And if you've got something like Johnson and people say the same about trust that they have very fixed positions, they reach idiosyncratic ideas, and then they want them delivered. The civil they can't do them on their own.\n\nPrime prime ministers can't make Policy happen. They they can devise policy, but you need civil servants to implement it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and add the problem, which is that The civil servants feel cowed and terrified so many, many departments, they're not putting up proper advice to ministers Because they're terrified about putting in writing things that are gonna get them attacked. A very toxic culture has been created Where if ministers don't like what they read, they jump up and down and they say, this is defeatist, this isn't echoing the messages we want. And the next thing you know, a few weeks later, they're saying, well, I don't like this briefing I've received. This is absolutely hopeless. You're not telling me anything.\n\nAnd the civil servant has to say, well, There's a reason why it's hopeless because if I actually wrote down on this bit of paper for the meeting that you're going into, minister, the truth of the ticket. My whole civil service department would go into a panic because the whole thing is terrified by these very erratic extreme views from some of the senior ministers.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think you should tell our listeners about the message you got from a a senior diplomat about the foreign office handling of our podcast?\n\nSpeaker 1: To to to be Absolutely clear. This was a message I got sometime ago. So this is not something which,\n\nSpeaker 0: this is not anything where trusting.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not it's and it's not\n\nSpeaker 0: But it might be because she was the foreign secretary at the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it was foreign secretary at the time. That's true. Foreign secretary at the time. But, definitely, it's something I received before the current trip. So this is somebody writing saying, like half the country, I'm a fan of the tonic that is the rest of his politics British diplomat.\n\nI thought I had to let you know, entirely unsourceable, of course, that FCDO has blocked the podcast download on official phones On account of explicit content, god forbid we offended the diplomats.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is that because of the rating? Because I think because I occasionally use the f word, we apparently are we've we are put down as the adult material, but it's kind of explicit, I think, is the word. I I didn't you know, I read that message out on our Liz Trust podcast, and something stopped me From reading the name of the person who sent it, and I'm very glad that I did because it turned out that they were a civil servant. So, there's a lot of angry people out there. And I'll tell you the thing I've noticed is I noticed it when I was at the Lido, This is not being seen as a new dawn, is it?\n\nI mean, people are just, god. It's right. There's no There's no great love to watch\n\nSpeaker 1: But there are opportunities for a new dawn. I don't think this trust is gonna take them. But but let's just take a moment here Just in in the fantasy world in which Alastair Campbell and Rory Stewart have any influence over events at all, here's one one one thought that I had. So So I'm traveling through Africa at the moment. I'm on my way to Kenya.\n\nBut I have the inauguration. The election's been upheld, so William Ruto is about to be inaugurated as president. I was at the last inauguration, which I think I told you about, where I got knocked at Roe back because a senior well, actually, not very senior Chinese official came in. I was considered much more important than I was. But, I do think the more that I travel around Africa, the more I realize that Britain has an opportunity To lead the world in changing the way it does development assistance, the way it does aid, African countries are completely fed up with the fact that they think of aid as very, very patronising.\n\nMost senior African politicians that I meet remember being lectured in the 1960s 70s, Remember the way in which development aid was used to try to humiliate and patronise African nations. They're looking For a new model, what they call a modern partnership.\n\nSpeaker 0: And Is that is that not what the Chinese are doing, though?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, This is, you're quite right to come to that. And this is where I think we come in. We are right here. Britain and Africa is right at the front line of taking on China and Russia. And the message I put to this trust is whatever you do, do not cut the development aid budget In places like Africa because we have a real opportunity to make a modern partnership which is not the Chinese and Russian partnership, One that differentiates itself and I, of course, would argue that one element of that is trusting Citizens in Africa by doing cash programmes, giving them choice, giving them freedom on how they not, not you and me turning up and telling people how to spend their money, But actually being really radical, setting up the beginnings for welfare state.\n\nSpeaker 0: If you're going to use a second successive main podcast to promote your new job about which we're all very, very happy. I'm going to jump forward and ask you one of the questions that we got this week. And I'm also then going to give you a couple of comments from the showers in the Lido, you'll be pleased to know. Stephen Findlay, if we paid all residents of the village in cash, and they all tried to buy a cow. How do we stop a cattle rancher with a few cows driving up prices?\n\nThat's the first question. Jim Down, who's a doctor who swims in the lie, though, he he he enjoyed hearing about your job, and he enjoyed and he he he loved your passion and excitement about it. His question was, how do you sustain that? How do you give them a cash payment and then build sustainable prosperity? And Russell Kay, who is also a swimmer, and he's worried that you underestimate the broader economic impact.\n\nAnd he's also worried about how you assess this unless you have the middle people, the assessors that you actually say you want to get rid of by just giving them cash. So there you are. We talk about nothing but your new job as a\n\nSpeaker 1: live incredibly kind. So just for listeners who haven't been keeping up, I've just taken over as the As the president, the the sort of CEO of a a charity called Give Directly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Get your title right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Get get it get it right. And, So 3 challenges there. I'm not sure I can deal with all of them in a very short answer. But firstly, on inflation, very, very good research the stuff. There have been over 200 academic papers on cash.\n\nAnd the truth is that if you do stuff in 1 village, it doesn't have a big inflation impact on the country. In fact, the model is that unless you put about 20% of the gross domestic product to the country in as cash, you're unlikely to drive up prices. What will happen is that people will respond. You're right. Somebody from a neighboring village will bring some cows over so they can be bought, but We don't end up with huge inflation in prices.\n\nNext next challenge,\n\nSpeaker 0: Sustainability.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Sustainability. So There it's true that there will always be people in any country who are going to have to continue to receive social security payments, true in Britain, true in the United States, true in Africa. Africa is no different. There will be people who are disabled, elderly, and we have to set up In the end, in countries as they develop something like a welfare state for people who can't look after themselves.\n\nBut there are many, many people, The majority, in fact, is the people who are currently living in extreme poverty, who are young, who are entrepreneurial, very, very young populations in Africa, for whom a lump sum cash payment gives them that opportunity to set up a business, to start trading. And it's remarkable, The data, been fantastic studies on this from Bangladeshi to Africa, that pretty soon people end up with very significant savings, investments, income because what's holding them back fundamentally?\n\nSpeaker 0: There must be some who just go and blow it. There must be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. There are definitely people who who go and blow it as there are in our own country. But but it but it's true that and, well, it's Human beings, you're giving money to human beings, but generally speaking, if you're one of the very, very extreme poor, you're not that likely to blow it because You really understand much more than you or I do the value of money because every single dollar means to them what 100 or $500 would mean to us.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Stephen Findlay can let us know whether he thought you answered the first part, and I will report back from Jim and Russell in the showers where we have these very elevated conversations.\n\nSpeaker 1: These conversations to the showers. So I also love this sort of vision of your morning. So you you wake up in the morning at 6:30 in the morning. Is that right? And then you go for a swim in an outdoor pool.\n\nIs it heat tip?\n\nSpeaker 0: With Fiona, no. It's not heat. In fact, it's too warm at the moment. It's too muddy. We like it really, really cold.\n\nDo so\n\nSpeaker 1: do you go in the middle of winter? Are you like one of these kind of polar bear types?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Through the winter. The the colder, the better.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's it's And and then to to get your blood pressure going, you then listen to Boris Johnson's resignation speech on your way home?\n\nSpeaker 0: Not not not every day. I mean, thank thank thankfully, there's only been the one resignation each. His brother's actually his brother Joe is actually an an irregular swimmer at the Lido. So we occasionally Have polite conversations about politics. What about the where where where so what about this, tell we talked a little bit about quasi quarteng.\n\nWhat What about James Clevely? What do you know about James Clevely?\n\nSpeaker 1: James Clevely, he was one of Boris Johnson's, my my memory of him I hope I'm getting this right, being unfair to James, I think he was one of Boris Johnson's lieutenants when Boris Johnson was mayor of London, served as deputy mayor for a bit. He, like me did a short course at Sandhurst, very short course at Sandhurst and then I think was in the Territorial Army. He's interesting. I mean, so from, I guess, I think he talks a lot about his background. It's quite an interesting background.\n\n1 black parent, 1 white parent. He, very, very proud of his military service. I mean, I like James, actually. I'm I'm sort of skirting around the edges of this. I wanted to tempt him to be my running mate when I ran for the leadership in 2019, and he quite sensibly threw in his lot with Boris Johnson, wouldn't have anything to do with me.\n\nNotwithstanding that slight grumble I have against him, the reason I did it is that he's actually, he's good at being funny. He talks normal better than most MPs. He's quite quick on Twitter and he's a grown up. I mean, he's somebody who you could take into a meeting with A senior foreign, for sure. And he'll be polite.\n\nHe'll listen. He'll be thoughtful.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is he clever?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I don't think he's I don't think he'd he'd say that his big thing is Is is that I think what he is is a he's a sensible, thoughtful person. I think he's somebody who\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you do you have think that foreign secretaries, particularly in the world that you Be fine. Do you think they need to be really clever? I really like clever foreign\n\nSpeaker 1: You like really clever foreign secretaries, do you? Who who's who's your favorite foreign secretaries?\n\nSpeaker 0: Ice I mean, I do think Robin Cook could be very, very tricky, but he was incredibly clever and smart, both politically and intellectually. I used to love Hans Dietrich Genscher. Do you remember with the yellow jump, please?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And then there was this tradition of very grand conservative foreign secretaries, wasn't it, going From Lord Carrington through to Douglas Heard?\n\nSpeaker 0: Douglas Heard. Yep. Doug I think Douglas Heard was clever.\n\nSpeaker 1: He well, of course, he was head by at Eton,\n\nSpeaker 0: Top story. My god. Oh, listen. We've done the diplomat. Shall we tell our listeners about about our other very distinguished listener who sent your message?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let you I will let you do the content of the said distinguished listener's message, and I will not say anything. I will let you present it at face value. And I actually thought he made quite a good case for himself.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I thought it was very, very brave. So the head head head pastor of Eton That's written in. As you anyone who's not been following this too I've had obviously, anyone who listens to this knows that all that Alastair does is grumble about you all the time. No.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's not all that I do. I do a lot of things.\n\nSpeaker 1: So he says, he says continuing, he's a very good, you're very, he's very game, the headmaster Sweden, continuing to love the podcast. New role sounds fascinating. I heard your q and a on Thursday. The stuff that Ethan's sending you a few bits and pieces to give you some more Ethan partnership info and And a copy of our recent inspection report.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think you should have the color that he listened to the last episode of the podcast driving to Middlesbrough. I thought that was quite interesting. He was driving to Middlesbrough.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good. So they're supporting new 6 forms, and they're bidding under the government's free school programme. They're gonna add Significant top up funding, £1,000,000 per school per year in perpetuity to the government funding, Schools yet to be approved, and then there was some quite quite nice articles. So Ian Ian Austin, Labour MP, who I guess you know. You know Ian Austin.\n\nRight?\n\nSpeaker 0: Ex Labour MP now appear appointed by Johnson, I think. But there was some there were some Labour council leaders who were giving their very positive\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Simon Henderson, who's the Hermos' Reardon, is levelling up education in the north by helping young people in deprived areas get into the best universities and the headline was Eton's woke headmaster deserves praise, not criticism. So, and actually I think it's a sort of maybe an attack on me, I don't know. He says Rather than briefing against, the headmaster says, old Etonian detractors would do better to focus on all he's doing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So I I just think I should let that, I will doubtless come back to say all sorts of things about Eton, but I I think fair play to the headmaster of Eton for listening to the podcast as he drives to one of these schools in a working class area of the north. Fair play to the headmaster of Eton for challenging me, for not being fair, and fair play for setting out What he's doing. I still think that Eton and Oxbridge are two of the reasons why this country is such a mess. But anyway\n\nSpeaker 1: But but didn't didn't didn't you go to Oxbridge, Alistair?\n\nSpeaker 0: I did. I did. I and that's that's why I can say as as an insider that I'm not persuaded that it does, all the good that claims.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's all all that amazing French and German we keep getting on the show. It's partly partly due partly due to that Oxford education. It may be time for a break. And welcome back to The Rest is Politics, with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tell us a bit about Chile, Biden, Trump. Any thoughts on what's happening internationally?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, first of all, before I I just wanna thank everybody who I got a lot of very, very nice message from our listeners last week about me talking about my depressive episode, which has sort of lingered all week, and I've it's rumbled on and off. But I just wanted to say we got some I know you did as well. We got some amazing, people sharing their stories, people getting hope and solidarity, so I really wanna say thank you for that. Chile was extraordinary this week.\n\nAbsolutely extraordinary. If you think about it, there were there was trouble in the streets. There was there was real violence going on and because there were massive calls for constitutional change. Okay? And so Gabriel Borics, this young 36 now guy comes along\n\nSpeaker 1: Who who we've all we spoke about. Just to remind readers that Gabriel Borics is this Amazing.\n\nSpeaker 0: The listeners the people listen to podcasts. Right? They read books and newspapers\n\nSpeaker 1: and magazines. Listen. It's kind of a classic kind of Sort of out of central casting student revolutionary, kind of big beard, casual clothes, became leader of his country at the age of 36, one of the youngest leaders in the entire world came in on the back of introducing a radical left wing populist constitution and then over to Alastair for the denouement of the story.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it comes along, and and it read and it was it was done through a, a 155 member consultative assembly of non kind of traditional political people. They came up with these mainly political newcomers. They came up with these Very, very, very far wide ranging and pretty radical proposals across social rights, environmental rights, gender equality, parity in government, Access to abortion, gay rights, plurinationalism, recognizing the indigenous communities in Chile, access to education, health, clean water, animal rights. It was a huge thing. And I get I fear it's one of those things where They just got carried away and put too much in, and they gave too much for their opponents to to go at.\n\nAnd he ended they they ended up losing by 61.9 to 38 point 1, which is pretty crushing. They're going to go back. They're going to do they they're going to ask them to to redo it and have another go. Because if they don't, they've still got Pinochet's constitution.\n\nSpeaker 1: The the whole thing is completely mad, isn't it? But it's also compulsory voting, so everybody it's not like Brexit where people have a A debate about what the majority of people thought. It's everybody voted and crushing 62% of people vote against, Which is really confusing for the new president. So he's elected on a manifesto if we're gonna bring change. It's also a real reminder of why one doesn't want to do referendums.\n\nRemember, we were Talking about this in relation to Colombia, where again, celebrity, you know, great Nobel Peace Prize winning president comes in, does this peace deal, Presents the referendum on the PCL to the people, and it's rejected.\n\nSpeaker 0: But they they had a referendum in 2020 on whether there should be a new constitution, And it passed by 80%. So so they won that one, then he won an election, and then he comes in, and they'd be So you trans but it was the other thing that was amazing this is why I think that, you know, we we when when people hear our interview with Mark Drakeford and we talk about the The importance of some of these constitutional questions, to see those massive crowds, really huge crowds out on the streets of Chile Campaigning one way or the other on these big constitutional questions. I actually found it incredibly exciting. And I and I and I think they'll come I I think they will come back with something. Now I think Biden Trump's worth mentioning just because of, I think, Biden's speech about you know, they they both basically made speeches last week saying that this We're now fighting for the soul of America, and it it sort of does feel like that.\n\nAnd I thought it was very interesting that Biden, I think for the first time, went very, very directly for Donald Trump as the cause of this absolute polarization. And, you know, they obviously fear the for the future of American democracy. It's Big moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's pretty pretty serious stuff, isn't it? Pretty serious stuff. Well, thank you guys very, very much. A bit of a short episode, today because we've been doing an enormous number of different different things. And We\n\nSpeaker 0: can't we can't leave without plugging Blackpool, Roy. And I've got an idea. I've got an idea.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. So this just to remind you, Winter Gardens Blackpool, huge, biggest venue, Alastair and I have ever played, Saturday, 8th October.\n\nSpeaker 0: Might be the biggest you ever played. I have actually You play big and royalty?\n\nSpeaker 1: I've done I've done the Albert Hall.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, you've done that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSaturday 8th October, 8 PM. I think we've we've pretty much sold out the bottom bit, But we've now gotta go up to the top bit. But what my idea was, Blackpool Illuminations. I mean, I know we've got an energy crisis, but apparently the Blackpool Illuminations are on, And they're free. So people should go to Blackpool to see the eliminations for free and then come and pay to see us.\n\nWhat a great idea that is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually, Blackpool is a very, very great place to visit. If you've not visited Blackpool, you must visit Blackpool as well as come in to hear the 2 of us.\n\nSpeaker 0: At the Winter Gardens, which you could Google to get access to the tickets that we made, because they're going very, very fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Well, thank you everybody very much. See some of you at Black Paul, and thank you, Alastair.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. See you again soon.",
