So welcome to another episode of The Rest is Politics Question Time with me, Alastair at handball. And me, Rory Stewart. And I'm a bit worried, Alastair, because you've been talking about how you want the first question, which is usually a bad sign. Well, I always Unlike you, Rory, I sit and go through all of them even when they're in the 1,000 because I think it's an important thing to do. But you've got a proper job now, so I accept you've got You've got all that to get on with. But this is my question of the week. It's from Andrew McEwan. Uh-huh. Apropos of nothing, he says. What is worse, An intelligent person pretending to be dim or a dim person pretending to be intelligent. And if we don't get the point, hashtag BOGO Trust. That's good. It's good. Yeah. I actually think it's quite an interesting question anyway, though. I'd I'd like to think about that a bit. I'm not sure I've got a really good answer. I think I think different forms of authenticity are irritating in quite different ways, but probably a stupid person pretending to be clever is more annoying than a clever person pretending to be stupid. Okay. Okay. And do do you do you think that sometimes Boris Johnson has pretended to be a bit of an oaf, or do you think he is a bit of an expert? No, I think he's actually rotted his brain. I think he stopped thinking when he was about 15 and has been coasting ever since. And I think the truth is that if you read his books and stuff, they're just he can't string a proper sentence together even when he's trying now. He he he did one last clever thing. He did a a lecture on the Latin poet, Horace, about, I suppose 12 years ago now, which was the last sign that there was something going on between the ears. And what about Liz Truss? Did we do I I think that Andrew McEwen is identifying Liz Truss as the dim person pretending Yeah. I I mean, I don't think Is that harsh? I don't yeah. I think that is harsh. I don't think Liz Truss is dim. I mean, she's she's I mean, as she keeps pointing out, she's very able mathematician. She's also, you know, obviously, like you, Oxbridge educated, and as she points out, went from a comprehensive school to to Oxbridge. I mean, obviously Helped by the fact, I guess, that her father's a maths professor. No, she's not stupid. I mean, I think the, you know, she's not very comfortable Giving public speeches, she gets herself into strange positions because I think she tends to make quite sort of, what's the word? She she makes decisions quite sort of quickly and abandons them quite quickly. It's not quite the same as being sort of I think she'd do fine on an IQ test. I didn't think that's the problem. Do you think we should do you think all prime ministers should have psychological assessments? Probably more important than the IQ test, but, Actually, if you come to think of it, I don't think being, I think judgment is really what you need. I mean, if you think about Atley, Who was obviously a really, really great prime minister. He probably wasn't the cleverest person in the Labour Party, but he was by far you know, his cabinet was full of people with enormous brains, but He was probably the best suited to be the prime minister, wasn't he? Andrew Carver. Rory, this is one for you. Why can't Rory Stewart Just accept that austerity was bad. It wasn't just bad in prisons. Surely, all ministers would have thought, not in my area, please. Firstly, I'm a little troubled because my brother-in-law is called Andrew Carver. So I'm still trying to get get my head around who exactly this Andrew Carver is. And he's also quite left wing. He was, he was Is is a brother-in-law as just explain the connection. So is he is he he's no longer married to my sister, but he was He was part of that, revolutionary group in Cambridge that burnt down a hotel in Cambridge in the late sixties. Although I think he I I think it's him. I I've just I've just decided that it's there. Probably is probably is him. So I think that Reducing the deficit, reducing the debt was a smart thing to do. And had we not done it, we would have been in a much, much bigger problem now that we've shot our debt up with COVID yet again. I think the one bit where George Osborne was right is that you do need to try to mend the roof while the sun's shining. And if you just let your debt deficit go I know. It would have been great if they'd done that. It would have been good if they'd done that. It really would have if they'd actually mended the roof of the sunshine. That would have been really good. Mark j Mark j, this is I think, again, I think this is more for you than me. If you go from The Cameron Tories to today's Tories, do you think that those Tories that have been alienated during that process, and I think we'd have to include you in that, Rory, are closer to Keir Starmer's Labour than they are to less trust his Tory party. Yes. I mean, obviously, I'm I'm probably That that probably is true about me. Yeah. And I I don't think anyone in this trust's cabinet would question that. I think if you said to Quasi Korting that I'm probably close So to Keir Starman, I answered his trust, he'd probably rule with laughter and say that you were right. Here we are. Jamie Dalrymple coming in with a question for you. Why is it that politicians all seem to adopt the same slightly unnatural position with their hands when making a point? It seems to be a closed fists with a thumb on top, which is used to point. I've never met anyone else who consciously makes this movement when talking. I think I I've remembered Sajid Javid does it, doesn't he? Tony Blair did it, and I wonder why that's that might be why a lot of people do it. I mean, it is quite a common thing. You put the thumb on the top like that and you do that. Liz Truss has very, very strange hand movements. John Major, I know. John Major used to use his hands a lot when speaking and still does, and he never separated the fingers. Yeah. Well, that's interesting. So George Osborne is very, very odd. He would often Let's just leave it there. George Osborne is very, very odd. For the stamps. Paragraph. If you watch his hands, they often sort of move sort of centrally in front of his chest. And David Cameron, when he was at the dispatch box, He'd sort of move very flat hands, float them over the top of the spatch box almost as though he was moving steam over a magic potion. But, basically, the answer is British people don't know how to talk with their hands. It's not a culture like Italy where we actually understand how to use our hands when we're speaking. I I think have you spent a lot Time with Tony Blair. I think because he doesn't do that other than when he's speaking under pressure or in public. He does it a little bit, but not that much. I think it's a way of Keeping his temperament under very, very tight control. I think he does it for that reason. Bill Clinton was much more Bill Clinton an amazing hand movement, and he used to sort of use it. His hands were part of his speech. I I do a lot. I I do a lot of hand movement. I love my hands when it's waving around when I'm speaking. I I I I think there's some I'm I'm I'm doing a DNA test, and I'm hoping to find some Italian explanation I've done I've done my DNA test, and it's it's virtually all, Scottish Irish with a bit with a bit of scandi. That's my problem. I did it for me and my father. My father was something like 99% Scottish and even worse, it was 99% From a very small area between Perthshire and Angus. We had a question, KP, from Sydney. Yeah. What were your parents like? I'm keen to foster an interest in my children in getting them interested in the world and showing compassion for others. We've talked a bit about our parents. My dad was a vet, from the Hebrides. My mother was a Farmer's daughter, and one of the happiest, nicest people that ever lived. Not that political. Interested in politics, but not that political. So So what about you? We've we've talked a bit we've talked a fair bit about I met your mum. She's a wonderful mum. Yeah. I think she's also actually, I mean, I I think she is a remarkably happy person. She, My father was a much, I mean, I I would have loved to introduce you to my father because he was a a sort of big, quite matcho, very opinionated Scott, with, you know, with a Scottish accent in a way that I don't have a Scottish accent, and he Was it posh Scottish? Or Posh Scottish, but But there was an edge of a Scottish accent then. He'd never been south of the border until he was 18 when he went to went to Oxford, so So never never left Scotland till he was 18 and then joined a Scottish regiment in the army, joined the Black Watch with his brother. What did he do to foster to my interest in the world. Well, he was an amazing traveller and he was wonderful about taking me with him. Probably my most memorable trip with him was he took me to Myanmar, to Burma, When he was 87 years old and he stumped around, I mean, he wasn't actually Physically that fit by that age. He was moving quite slowly, but every morning he'd get up 5:30 in the morning and he'd go out and he'd find Breakfast food off a stall in the market and a map, and he'd come stomping back into our hotel room. We'd share a hotel room, little twin beds, And dump on my bed some extraordinary kind of sugary fried objects that he'd found in the market And then drag me out for a march around which poking things with his stick. So, anyway, that's that's my follow-up. How old was he how old was he when you wrote you wrote the book when you were walking with him. So he was that that that that age. I I wrote it in with him in his late eighties and then tickets. Into his early nineties. He actually died at 93. He would be a 100 if he was still alive today and I was with him when he died. I tried to resuscitate him unsuccessfully when he died, but he went in the most wonderful way with so much, courage. It's absolutely wonderful. I mean, he he started having a heart attack and he said to me, Rory, this is not good, And he pointed at a box of pills that I brought over. But just then and in the sort of half hour leading up to it, He just so, you know, I was so proud of him and in an odd way, I haven't mourned him much because I loved him so much and felt that, yeah, that that him him him leaving in in the right way was good. Tell me about your father. He he was also born in 1922, born in Tiree in the Hebrides, was left the island to go to A school in his teens, went to Glasgow University, became a vet. My mom actually I think I may have told you this before. My mom, At one point, broke off their engagement because he refused to countenance going to work in England. If he he was adamant he'd be able to get but but, actually, there were there was a dearth a a glut of vets in Scotland and a dearth of vets in England. So, eventually, My mum called it off, and then but they did eventually go to England, and then he got a practice. And and, He was he was, he didn't live as as long as your your dad. He was 82 when he died. I regret the fact that I was with neither of my parents. I think I've told you before, my mum I was in I was in I was actually way where you live now in Jordan when my mum had her stroke, and she was dead by the time I got home. I did Have a that sort of final conversation with my dad when I knew he was dying, and I do think those conversations are incredibly important, But I regret the fact that I'd I I never had that with my mom. Yeah. Here's a question to try to get yourself solemn subjects. Because I'm beginning to worry. There's all these names coming in that seem sort of weirdly familiar. So somebody who calls himself Alan Duncan And maybe sir Alan Duncan. Greetings from Addis Ababa, says, brackets possibly, sir Alan Duncan. Do you think the exodus of international NGO personnel from Ethiopia as a result of the security situation will be good or bad for Ethiopia's development trajectory? Wow. Do Do you think that is Alan Duncan, the MP Alan Duncan? No. I I I'm just going back to one. You you had one called JB Del Red Bull. The guy who trained ran the training scheme on the Daily Mirror when I was there was called Jim Dalrymple. Maybe we're just getting all our yesterdays coming in here. I doubt that is Sir Alan Duncan. I hope the I hope the answer to that question is that it'd be bad for the development of Ethiopia. Because if if if development could happen without these NGOs, then I'm not I'm not convinced by that. And and And we talked about Ethiopia recently. It is an interesting experience. I want to put out an apology because I've been challenged by people and the Mail and the Mail on Sunday and people who are not my natural allies I've been picking up on some of the comments I made about some of the things that I thought were wrong about international development. Just to put it on the record, I think that We should be increasing our development spend, that it's true that we have got a lot of things wrong. Of course we have. We spent £4,000,000,000 in Malawi, and it's difficult to see over over 50 years, and it's difficult to see What that did. But the truth is that I think we've got some amazing professionals, and we need them. We desperately need people. We need people In the foreign office and what used to be different in policy, thinking about some of the big issues on how to end poverty. And if I'm right, the cash is a big bit of that, Only 1 or 2% of the international development spent on cash at the moment. I think it should be nearly half spent on cash, but getting there is gonna require Some very smart economists and policy brains pushing that forward. By the way, Roy, we had a few people say that they didn't think that we answered the questions. Sometimes we got the questions, we debated them, but we didn't always answer them. I thought that was a bit harsh, but we should bear it in mind. James Peterson. We're not getting many questions from women here, but I'm gonna stick with this one. James Peterson. I don't know whether that's James Peterson that I went to school with. You you rarely you rarely discuss the Liberal Democrats, but they could be kingmakers. It's true, actually. We don't talk about them much, do we? No. We don't talk about them enough, do we? And and I that may be some horrible kind of conservative labor snobbery that we never really take Seriously, we just talk about the big parties. We talk about we as we did in the in the interview with, soon to be, put out with Mark Draper, we did talk about, And he agreed, I think, that he felt that Labour and the Lib Dems should be working pretty closely together in terms of a general election strategy. But it's true with her. But I guess that's a consequence of them getting you know, doing so badly at the last election. But we should we should. We we should talk about more, and we should maybe get one Well, maybe a not serving politician, getting to reflect on that. I like Paddy Ashtam. The I went to see Paddy Ashtam on it. Because Paddy Ashtam is RIP. She's not with us anymore, but I went to see Paliashten when I was thinking of becoming an MP for the first time for advice. And his big bit of advice to me was whatever you do, don't become a Lib Dem. I'll give I'll give you I I've got lots of stories of Padishtani. We we, But when I was a journalist on the Sunday Mirror, I went to interview him down at his house in his constituency in Somerset, and I was quite a young journalist. And I realized after the interview was concluded that I didn't Turn my tape on, and I hadn't taken any notes. And Jane, his wife, just said, well, I think you should probably do it again, Patty. Patty won't mind. Oh. Yeah. That was nice. So, Als, I'm afraid we're gonna have to wrap because you may be able to hear at the edge of this podcast that there is a steel band playing outside. Side. I'm in Kampala, Uganda, and I've got 40 members of our charity from 9 different African countries outside waiting to meet me who aren't gonna be very amused. I'm on the podcast all the time. This is a last question from Ruth Wells for you. Do you 2 ever watch TV? I'm a priest in the Church of England who admitted loving the new season of Married at First Sight UK in my sermon to the congregation this morning, smiley face with tears, What are your go to rubbish TV programs? Over to you, Alastair. I I try not to watch rubbish TV, but I do like we we watched, We're watching CAPTCHA at the moment Uh-huh. Which is a thing about, deep fake technology, which is quite scary. We recently watched Blackbird, which was extraordinary. The guy who played Elton John, Taranee Edgerton, He's absolutely brilliant in it, playing an American a former American footballer who becomes a drug dealer, gets into prison, And gets offered the chance to go into what would be a kind of, Broadmoor to try to get this kind of psychopath guy admit to previous offenses. It is it is so tense, and absolutely brilliant. So, look, I don't want I don't want much telly, but I I do watch a So my recommendation for the moment, although I must confess I just caught it on the plane flying to Camp Palace, I didn't finish the movie. That's a great recommendation. But I thought mesmerizing was a film called The Contractor with Chris Chris Pine in it because it was the most wonderful, At the beginning, at least, examination of what takes people out of the military to become private security contractors And the medical challenges they face and the murky world of security contracting. In his case, he gets dragged into kind of American black ops At the moment, at least, at which our plane landed. Oh, my dog. Couldn't you have just sort of said, look. I I haven't finished the film yet. No. I'm a very important person. Uh-huh. I don't know whether you're Rory, should you really be admitting that you're watching films on planes? It's technically working, traveling to I just want to point out it's economy class flight, central seat, lots of screaming babies all the way around me, and I had been working until then. Now, Thank you all very, very much, and and have a lovely, lovely, day. All the best. Speak",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSo welcome to another episode of The Rest is Politics Question Time with me, Alastair at handball.\n\nSpeaker 1: And me, Rory Stewart. And I'm a bit worried, Alastair, because you've been talking about how you want the first question, which is usually a bad sign.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I always Unlike you, Rory, I sit and go through all of them even when they're in the 1,000 because I think it's an important thing to do. But you've got a proper job now, so I accept you've got You've got all that to get on with. But this is my question of the week. It's from Andrew McEwan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 0: Apropos of nothing, he says. What is worse, An intelligent person pretending to be dim or a dim person pretending to be intelligent. And if we don't get the point, hashtag BOGO Trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good. It's good. Yeah. I actually think it's quite an interesting question anyway, though. I'd I'd like to think about that a bit.\n\nI'm not sure I've got a really good answer. I think I think different forms of authenticity are irritating in quite different ways, but probably a stupid person pretending to be clever is more annoying than a clever person pretending to be stupid.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. And do do you do you think that sometimes Boris Johnson has pretended to be a bit of an oaf, or do you think he is a bit of an expert?\n\nSpeaker 1: No, I think he's actually rotted his brain. I think he stopped thinking when he was about 15 and has been coasting ever since. And I think the truth is that if you read his books and stuff, they're just he can't string a proper sentence together even when he's trying now. He he he did one last clever thing. He did a a lecture on the Latin poet, Horace, about, I suppose 12 years ago now, which was the last sign that there was something going on between the ears.\n\nSpeaker 0: And what about Liz Truss? Did we do I I think that Andrew McEwen is identifying Liz Truss as the dim person pretending Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I mean, I don't think Is\n\nSpeaker 0: that harsh?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't yeah. I think that is harsh. I don't think Liz Truss is dim. I mean, she's she's I mean, as she keeps pointing out, she's very able mathematician. She's also, you know, obviously, like you, Oxbridge educated, and as she points out, went from a comprehensive school to to Oxbridge.\n\nI mean, obviously Helped by the fact, I guess, that her father's a maths professor. No, she's not stupid. I mean, I think the, you know, she's not very comfortable Giving public speeches, she gets herself into strange positions because I think she tends to make quite sort of, what's the word? She she makes decisions quite sort of quickly and abandons them quite quickly. It's not quite the same as being sort of I think she'd do fine on an IQ test.\n\nI didn't think that's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think we should do you think all prime ministers should have psychological assessments?\n\nSpeaker 1: Probably more important than the IQ test, but, Actually, if you come to think of it, I don't think being, I think judgment is really what you need. I mean, if you think about Atley, Who was obviously a really, really great prime minister. He probably wasn't the cleverest person in the Labour Party, but he was by far you know, his cabinet was full of people with enormous brains, but He was probably the best suited to be the prime minister, wasn't he?\n\nSpeaker 0: Andrew Carver. Rory, this is one for you. Why can't Rory Stewart Just accept that austerity was bad. It wasn't just bad in prisons. Surely, all ministers would have thought, not in my area, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: Firstly, I'm a little troubled because my brother-in-law is called Andrew Carver. So I'm still trying to get get my head around who exactly this Andrew Carver is. And he's also quite left wing. He was, he was\n\nSpeaker 0: Is is a brother-in-law as just explain the connection.\n\nSpeaker 1: So is he is he he's no longer married to my sister, but he was He was part of that, revolutionary group in Cambridge that burnt down a hotel in Cambridge in the late sixties. Although I think he I\n\nSpeaker 0: I think it's him. I I've just I've just decided that it's there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Probably is probably is him. So I think that Reducing the deficit, reducing the debt was a smart thing to do. And had we not done it, we would have been in a much, much bigger problem now that we've shot our debt up with COVID yet again. I think the one bit where George Osborne was right is that you do need to try to mend the roof while the sun's shining. And if you just let your debt deficit go\n\nSpeaker 0: I know. It would have been great if they'd done that. It would have been good if they'd done that. It really would have if they'd actually mended the roof of the sunshine. That would have been really good.\n\nMark j Mark j, this is I think, again, I think this is more for you than me. If you go from The Cameron Tories to today's Tories, do you think that those Tories that have been alienated during that process, and I think we'd have to include you in that, Rory, are closer to Keir Starmer's Labour than they are to less trust his Tory party.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I mean, obviously, I'm I'm probably That that probably is true about me. Yeah. And I I don't think anyone in this trust's cabinet would question that. I think if you said to Quasi Korting that I'm probably close So to Keir Starman, I answered his trust, he'd probably rule with laughter and say that you were right.\n\nHere we are. Jamie Dalrymple coming in with a question for you. Why is it that politicians all seem to adopt the same slightly unnatural position with their hands when making a point? It seems to be a closed fists with a thumb on top, which is used to point. I've never met anyone else who consciously makes this movement when talking.\n\nI think I I've remembered Sajid Javid does it, doesn't he?\n\nSpeaker 0: Tony Blair did it, and I wonder why that's that might be why a lot of people do it. I mean, it is quite a common thing. You put the thumb on the top like that and you do that. Liz Truss has very, very strange hand movements. John Major, I know.\n\nJohn Major used to use his hands a lot when speaking and still does, and he never separated the fingers.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, that's interesting. So George Osborne is very, very odd. He would often\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's just leave it there. George Osborne is very, very odd.\n\nSpeaker 1: For the stamps. Paragraph. If you watch his hands, they often sort of move sort of centrally in front of his chest. And David Cameron, when he was at the dispatch box, He'd sort of move very flat hands, float them over the top of the spatch box almost as though he was moving steam over a magic potion. But, basically, the answer is British people don't know how to talk with their hands.\n\nIt's not a culture like Italy where we actually understand how to use our hands when we're speaking.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I think have you spent a lot Time with Tony Blair. I think because he doesn't do that other than when he's speaking under pressure or in public. He does it a little bit, but not that much. I think it's a way of Keeping his temperament under very, very tight control.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think\n\nSpeaker 0: he does it for that reason. Bill Clinton was much more Bill Clinton an amazing hand movement, and he used to sort of use it. His hands were part of his speech.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I do a lot. I I do a lot of hand movement. I love my hands when it's waving around when I'm speaking. I I I I think there's some I'm I'm I'm doing a DNA test, and I'm hoping to find some Italian explanation\n\nSpeaker 0: I've done I've done my DNA test, and it's it's virtually all, Scottish Irish with a bit with a bit of scandi.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's my problem. I did it for me and my father. My father was something like 99% Scottish and even worse, it was 99% From a very small area between Perthshire and Angus.\n\nSpeaker 0: We had a question, KP, from Sydney. Yeah. What were your parents like? I'm keen to foster an interest in my children in getting them interested in the world and showing compassion for others. We've talked a bit about our parents.\n\nMy dad was a vet, from the Hebrides. My mother was a Farmer's daughter, and one of the happiest, nicest people that ever lived. Not that political. Interested in politics, but not that political. So So what about you?\n\nWe've we've talked a bit we've talked a fair bit about I met your mum. She's a wonderful mum.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think she's also actually, I mean, I I think she is a remarkably happy person. She, My father was a much, I mean, I I would have loved to introduce you to my father because he was a a sort of big, quite matcho, very opinionated Scott, with, you know, with a Scottish accent in a way that I don't have a Scottish accent, and he\n\nSpeaker 0: Was it posh Scottish? Or\n\nSpeaker 1: Posh Scottish, but But there was an edge of a Scottish accent then. He'd never been south of the border until he was 18 when he went to went to Oxford, so So never never left Scotland till he was 18 and then joined a Scottish regiment in the army, joined the Black Watch with his brother. What did he do to foster to my interest in the world. Well, he was an amazing traveller and he was wonderful about taking me with him. Probably my most memorable trip with him was he took me to Myanmar, to Burma, When he was 87 years old and he stumped around, I mean, he wasn't actually Physically that fit by that age.\n\nHe was moving quite slowly, but every morning he'd get up 5:30 in the morning and he'd go out and he'd find Breakfast food off a stall in the market and a map, and he'd come stomping back into our hotel room. We'd share a hotel room, little twin beds, And dump on my bed some extraordinary kind of sugary fried objects that he'd found in the market And then drag me out for a march around which poking things with his stick. So, anyway, that's that's my follow-up.\n\nSpeaker 0: How old was he how old was he when you wrote you wrote the book when you were walking with him.\n\nSpeaker 1: So he was that that that that age. I I wrote it in with him in his late eighties and then tickets. Into his early nineties. He actually died at 93. He would be a 100 if he was still alive today and I was with him when he died.\n\nI tried to resuscitate him unsuccessfully when he died, but he went in the most wonderful way with so much, courage. It's absolutely wonderful. I mean, he he started having a heart attack and he said to me, Rory, this is not good, And he pointed at a box of pills that I brought over. But just then and in the sort of half hour leading up to it, He just so, you know, I was so proud of him and in an odd way, I haven't mourned him much because I loved him so much and felt that, yeah, that that him him him leaving in in the right way was good. Tell me about your father.\n\nSpeaker 0: He he was also born in 1922, born in Tiree in the Hebrides, was left the island to go to A school in his teens, went to Glasgow University, became a vet. My mom actually I think I may have told you this before. My mom, At one point, broke off their engagement because he refused to countenance going to work in England. If he he was adamant he'd be able to get but but, actually, there were there was a dearth a a glut of vets in Scotland and a dearth of vets in England. So, eventually, My mum called it off, and then but they did eventually go to England, and then he got a practice.\n\nAnd and, He was he was, he didn't live as as long as your your dad. He was 82 when he died. I regret the fact that I was with neither of my parents. I think I've told you before, my mum I was in I was in I was actually way where you live now in Jordan when my mum had her stroke, and she was dead by the time I got home. I did Have a that sort of final conversation with my dad when I knew he was dying, and I do think those conversations are incredibly important, But I regret the fact that I'd I I never had that with my mom.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Here's a question to try to get yourself solemn subjects. Because I'm beginning to worry. There's all these names coming in that seem sort of weirdly familiar. So somebody who calls himself Alan Duncan And maybe sir Alan Duncan.\n\nGreetings from Addis Ababa, says, brackets possibly, sir Alan Duncan. Do you think the exodus of international NGO personnel from Ethiopia as a result of the security situation will be good or bad for Ethiopia's development trajectory? Wow. Do Do you think that is Alan Duncan, the MP Alan Duncan? No.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I I'm just going back to one. You you had one called JB Del Red Bull. The guy who trained ran the training scheme on the Daily Mirror when I was there was called Jim Dalrymple. Maybe we're just getting all our yesterdays coming in here. I doubt that is Sir Alan Duncan.\n\nI hope the I hope the answer to that question is that it'd be bad for the development of Ethiopia. Because if if if development could happen without these NGOs, then I'm not I'm not convinced by that. And and And we talked about Ethiopia recently. It is\n\nSpeaker 1: an interesting experience. I want to put out an apology because I've been challenged by people and the Mail and the Mail on Sunday and people who are not my natural allies I've been picking up on some of the comments I made about some of the things that I thought were wrong about international development. Just to put it on the record, I think that We should be increasing our development spend, that it's true that we have got a lot of things wrong. Of course we have. We spent £4,000,000,000 in Malawi, and it's difficult to see over over 50 years, and it's difficult to see What that did.\n\nBut the truth is that I think we've got some amazing professionals, and we need them. We desperately need people. We need people In the foreign office and what used to be different in policy, thinking about some of the big issues on how to end poverty. And if I'm right, the cash is a big bit of that, Only 1 or 2% of the international development spent on cash at the moment. I think it should be nearly half spent on cash, but getting there is gonna require Some very smart economists and policy brains pushing that forward.\n\nSpeaker 0: By the way, Roy, we had a few people say that they didn't think that we answered the questions. Sometimes we got the questions, we debated them, but we didn't always answer them. I thought that was a bit harsh, but we should bear it in mind. James Peterson. We're not getting many questions from women here, but I'm gonna stick with this one.\n\nJames Peterson. I don't know whether that's James Peterson that I went to school with. You you rarely you rarely discuss the Liberal Democrats, but they could be kingmakers. It's true, actually. We don't talk about them much, do we?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. We don't talk about them enough, do we? And and I that may be some horrible kind of conservative labor snobbery that we never really take Seriously, we just talk about the big parties.\n\nSpeaker 0: We talk about we as we did in the in the interview with, soon to be, put out with Mark Draper, we did talk about, And he agreed, I think, that he felt that Labour and the Lib Dems should be working pretty closely together in terms of a general election strategy. But it's true with her. But I guess that's a consequence of them getting you know, doing so badly at the last election. But we should we should. We we\n\nSpeaker 1: should talk about more, and we should maybe get one Well, maybe a not serving politician, getting to reflect on that. I like Paddy Ashtam. The I went to see Paddy Ashtam\n\nSpeaker 0: on it. Because Paddy Ashtam is RIP.\n\nSpeaker 1: She's not with us anymore, but I went to see Paliashten when I was thinking of becoming an MP for the first time for advice. And his big bit of advice to me was whatever you do, don't become a Lib Dem.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll give I'll give you I I've got lots of stories of Padishtani. We we, But when I was a journalist on the Sunday Mirror, I went to interview him down at his house in his constituency in Somerset, and I was quite a young journalist. And I realized after the interview was concluded that I didn't Turn my tape on, and I hadn't taken any notes. And Jane, his wife, just said, well, I think you should probably do it again, Patty. Patty won't mind.\n\nOh. Yeah. That was nice.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Als, I'm afraid we're gonna have to wrap because you may be able to hear at the edge of this podcast that there is a steel band playing outside. Side. I'm in Kampala, Uganda, and I've got 40 members of our charity from 9 different African countries outside waiting to meet me who aren't gonna be very amused. I'm on the podcast all the time. This is a last question from Ruth Wells for you.\n\nDo you 2 ever watch TV? I'm a priest in the Church of England who admitted loving the new season of Married at First Sight UK in my sermon to the congregation this morning, smiley face with tears, What are your go to rubbish TV programs? Over to you, Alastair.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I try not to watch rubbish TV, but I do like we we watched, We're watching CAPTCHA at the moment Uh-huh. Which is a thing about, deep fake technology, which is quite scary. We recently watched Blackbird, which was extraordinary. The guy who played Elton John, Taranee Edgerton, He's absolutely brilliant in it, playing an American a former American footballer who becomes a drug dealer, gets into prison, And gets offered the chance to go into what would be a kind of, Broadmoor to try to get this kind of psychopath guy admit to previous offenses. It is it is so tense, and absolutely brilliant.\n\nSo, look, I don't want I don't want much telly, but I I do watch a\n\nSpeaker 1: So my recommendation for the moment, although I must confess I just caught it on the plane flying to Camp Palace, I didn't finish the movie. That's a great recommendation. But I thought mesmerizing was a film called The Contractor with Chris Chris Pine in it because it was the most wonderful, At the beginning, at least, examination of what takes people out of the military to become private security contractors\n\nSpeaker 0: And\n\nSpeaker 1: the medical challenges they face and the murky world of security contracting. In his case, he gets dragged into kind of American black ops At the moment, at least, at which our plane landed.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, my dog. Couldn't you have just sort of said, look. I I haven't finished the film yet. No. I'm a very important person.\n\nUh-huh. I don't know whether you're Rory, should you really be admitting that you're watching films on planes? It's technically working, traveling to\n\nSpeaker 1: I just want to point out it's economy class flight, central seat, lots of screaming babies all the way around me, and I had been working until then. Now, Thank you all very, very much, and and have a lovely, lovely, day.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best. Speak",
