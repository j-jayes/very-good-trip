That's the rest is politics .com. Now we're delighted to have an interview with the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, And please don't be too surprised if we don't talk about the queen or king Charles because the interview was conducted shortly before the sad demise of her majesty. Welcome to The Rest is Politics with me, Alastair Campbell and me, Rory Stewart. And a very special guest, we are absolutely delighted to welcome the 1st minister of Wales, Mark Greatford. Mark, hello, and thank you for being here. Very pleased to be here. Now can I kick off? Because every time I read about you in any sort of profile piece, the word, Corbynista, gets attached to you, and I can see from the Grievous that that probably irritates you a bit. But I just wanna get a sense of your politics. If if we accept that Jeremy Is, say, on the left of the party, and my old boss, Tony, is on the right of the party. Where are you putting yourself adjacent or between them? Well, I think in my own politics as being derived from the radical Welsh tradition. And, you know, that can go back as far as Lloyd George and gets handed down The generations via Bevan, Michael Foote, Neil Kinnock. It's that strand in Welsh politics, Which is to the left of the center, but, you know, all of politics in Wales is to the left of where it would be across the United Kingdom. And insofar as I think of myself as belonging to a tradition, it is to that sort of radical strand in Bosch politics. And, Mark, can you help help me on this because I'm obviously a an ex Tory talking to you and a lot of this is is alien to me and I'm trying to understand the world she grew up in. So You're you're somebody who's been described as an atheist republican socialist. Is that is that roughly true? I'm not brave enough to be an atheist. I'm an, I'm an agnostic. Oh, good. But, the other things would be true. The other things would be true. And when you were growing up, it was a very dominant figure, actually, even when you were an adult because you came, I think, into elected politics surprisingly late. We're in a world where, most of the last lot of prime ministers have gotten in their forties, early fifties. I think you didn't become an elected member till you were in your late fifties, did you? You had a whole Separate career as an academic universities. But I've noticed this this big figure called Jack Brooks who seems to dominate a lot of talking about the early eighties in Wales and I'd love a sense of what Labour politics in Wales felt like in the late seventies, early eighties when you were beginning to get involved, what kind of character he was And how it's changed? I mean, how would Jack Brooks think about the Welsh Labour Party if he was to turn up today? Maybe you could tell this. It's a bit about Jack Brooks before you tell us a little bit Answer that question. Yeah. Well, I became a counselor in my twenties. Jack was the leader of South Morgan Council during the time that I was a councilor, so I certainly saw him a very close quarters. He was in if you've contrasted modern politics to the politics that Jack grew up in. And it was pretty much a sort of male dominated, probably boss led Solo politics, you know, where big beasts dominated local councils across Wales. And was he a boxer? He if you're interested in boxing, wasn't he? Yeah. Yeah. No. He was. He's a plasterer, by, by training. If you if you wanted to Learn something about him. I'll I'll tell you a story that he used to tell, which was going out to a young man in his, You know, early twenties to a nightclub in Cardiff. He's all dressed up. He's ready for a night out. He sees a young woman, across the floor, and she's looking at him. And, you know, he thinks, well, my mind could be turning up a bit, here. And, you know, she comes across the floor, Tim, and says to him, oh, you're Jack Brooks, aren't you? And you think you definitely think tonight is getting better. And she says to him, you're the kid who used to have free school meals. And I think it's that sort of experience, really, which shaped Hey. One would have shaped many other people in the Labour Party. You know, that sense that people are not to be shaped by their other gyms And that the job of the party is to provide the chances for people to be able to make the very most of their talents and their abilities. Just one more sort of push at this before I bring back Alastair. Help us understand the idea of a a sort of boss figure in Early eighties politics, but it's not too sensitive. Maybe this is too sensitive. Maybe you're gonna be offending Labour Party listeners by talking too frankly about this. But I saw a glimpse of this in politics in Scotland in the in the nineties when things really felt as though they were run by bosses. What what did that feel like in terms of how things were run and operated? Shall I tell you a story that appeared in the Guardian obituary of lord Haycock? Right. So, lord Haycock ran the old Glamorgan County Council, and, you know, nothing moved Without, lord Haycock having ordained that he should move, and the story in the obituary was of 2 Jehovah's Witnesses, knocking the door of his home that's outside Port Talbot. And, lady Hiccup comes to the door, and the 2 Jehovah's Witnesses Say to her, does the lord dwell in this house? To which she is alleged to have replied, yes. He does, but he's out watching at the moment. And, I think that might give you just a flavor of what it was like to be a dominant figure in Welsh local governments. A long time ago now. It's very different. So Do you think we we've talked on when we we did a a special episode recently about when Liz Truss was made prime minister, and we were Talking about the fact there have been now 3 conservative women prime ministers, do you think that, historically, the male dominance of the Labour Party and the trade union movement has has been part of legacy that has made it more difficult for labor to find a woman prime minister. Well, I think it is part of our our history, But we are capable of amending it. You know, I lead a labor group in the senate, which is 17 women and 13 men In it, there are 5 women in my cabinets and 4 men and women fill all the major sorts of, ministerial Physicians are not in any way confined to what you might have thought as the traditional, responsibilities that women would undertake. So, You know, that is a very steep change to the sort of world in which, you know, my early experience of labor politics in Wales Would have been shaped. So we are capable of amending our own history, and we need to go on doing that. Now we don't wanna talk too much about the Richard Boris Johnson, But I got the sense of your relationship with him being very, very difficult. What do you think the relationship between the first minister of Wales The UK prime minister should be, and what hopes do you have for a better relationship with Liz Truss and how realistic doing that is? Well, the fundamental word is that it Needs to be respectful. So I go to the series of, you know, different prime ministers, including conservative prime ministers. And I think there was a very big contrast between relations with Theresa May when she was prime minister and with her Success. I disagreed with missus May on almost anything you'd like to say and, you know, was terribly frustrated at what I thought was her fundamental Mistake in regarding Brexit as a winner takes all, sort of referendum. But I would describe her as an instinctive democrat. If you were in a room with her and she was prime minister, she would make a conscious effort to make sure that Anybody in the room who had a view they wanted to contribute had an opportunity to contribute to that view. And, you know, that is a sort of instinctive respect for The range of different individuals and experiences that you will you will come across. So I think it is perfectly possible to have Good, effective, constructive working relationships with people who are in a different party from you and occupy a different position. But it's got to be founded on a basic sense of respect and parity of participation. You know, Wales is a small country. It is not the same as a country the size of England, but parity of participation is something different. You know, every voice has a right to be heard and to be treated respectfully. And you felt that Johnson didn't treat you with respect? On an individual level, on the rare occasions that I had direct conversations with mister Johnson, he, you know, he he was courteous. He He wasn't disrespectful in that way, but his approach to the future of the United Kingdom was very different. You know, Theresa May in the final lecture in Edinburgh described the United Kingdom as a voluntary association of 4 nations. I think that was, you know, the end of quite a long journey probably for her. Boris Johnson believed that the way to save the United Kingdom was to, you know, assert muscular unionism. Mhmm. Holy boy Britain, as you might, more pejoratively put it in which The way to secure the future of the United Kingdom is to show who is boss, and, actually, that was completely counterproductive and contributes to the fragility of the United Kingdom Rather than helping it to be something which people choose to belong to, want to belong to. Can I come in quickly on this? You're somebody who describes yourself as a a federalist or a unionist, but I guess there were some people who were quite Shocked to to see you, as it were, get into bed with Plaid Comrie and I I wondered whether That was something that gave you any moments for pause or reflection before you did it? Well, it could only be shocking to somebody outside Wales. You know, my party's been in power, in Wales throughout the history of devolution, but we've never won more than 30 of the 60 seats on offer. So we have always had to work with other individuals and other parties in order to be able to get the job Done. We had a full coalition with, like, coming in 2007 where Rodri Morgan, one of my predecessors, was the 1st minister. What we have learned is as a party in Wales is that working with other progressive parties is not something to regard as Unusual or difficult. It's challenging, but it can be done. And we've demonstrated that it can be done, and The current cooperation we have with Placomery is designed to allow us to deliver on the most radical parts of our agenda, things which I think are very difficult to do if you're a party on your own and certainly a party that has only half the seats available. So I I know at the UK level, the idea of working across parties is regarded as, you know, somehow a failure of the system. No. No. No. No. No. Let me push back a little bit, Mark. It's not not that I mean, I was part of a coalition with Lib Dems. I think it's the problem of working with a party that's explicitly committed to independence. Well, obviously, I fundamentally disagree with them on that point. I believe in strong and entrenched Devolution where decisions are made as close to people as possible. But I also believe that the United Kingdom is better off for having Wales in it, and Wales is better off of being in the United Kingdom, but that's because we choose to belong to it because we think there are important purposes that we discharge better together. Well, I disagree with Paul Connery, on that, and we fought an election only a year or so ago where that choice was very explicitly with people. That doesn't mean that there aren't very important things that we are able to agree on and can work together, I'll be able to see it, you know, for the benefit of the people who have elected us. We had we had Keir Starmer on the podcast a a few weeks ago, And he I think he disappointed both of us really in that he didn't seem to share our belief that politics was now Potentially so broken that there has to be at least a debate about some pretty major political and constitutional change. And to be fair, you have been pushing out some ideas for further reform of the constitution and further form reform of of democracy. Do you not think that Labour nationally is, Across the UK is missing a bit of a trick in playing into this worry about the state of our politics rather than actually defending the status quo. Well, I think, Kirsten Martin did a very important thing in commissioning Gordon Brown to lead a piece of work which will Range over, you know, a series of these really important constitutional questions. I've had the chance to, stay very close to the work Of the commission, I was talking to Gordon about it last week. I think when it is published, you know, it will set out the prospectus for labor That will give us the the arguments that are needed and the rigor of, debate behind it. But, well, I think, you know, be provide quite a radical perspectives For the future of the United Kingdom. I have to say, I I'm never interested in constitutional questions because they are constitutional questions. I'm interested in them because they are the way in which we are better able to solve the problems that face people in their daily lives. That's why we should be interested in them because they give us the basis for doing that. To take take one example then, I mean, one one of the problems that we certainly feel in Westminster is That the existing parties feel very, very tired and one of the reasons why certainly I support proportional representation is to give room for new, fresher parties to emerge, to break up some of those old structures, to give voters a chance, To be a bit more entrepreneurial and maybe to provide a bit of challenge to some of those old stuffy parties and make them step up their game rather than assuming that They can continue to have a 2 party dominance. So looking at the horror of the last, decade or more And the way how stultified Westminster politics feels. I would have thought proportional representation is a real solution to a problem. It's not constitutional change for its own sake. Well, I I work in a proportional system. You know, the senate is elected, under a system of PR, and we have proposals to reform The way the senate is, elected that would make it even more, proportional. So I have no problem at all with that argument. You know, I I'm a bit heretical. I've Said it in the past, but, I think you can make a good argument for saying that administrations that have people From more than 1 tradition in in them have a level of internal challenge. That means by the time you come to put your ideas in front of the wider Electorate. They are better ideas because they've already had to be tested with people who don't come at the problems in exactly the same way as you do or your party does. So, in terms of trying to, you know, not have a certified narrow debate that just sticks Within the parameters, I think our experience in Wales in which, you know, in every election, we've had to work with other people. The challenge that brings with it is actually good for democracy and, I think, improves the quality of policymaking. If would would you not be happy If you felt that there was actually quite a lot of cooperation right now between Labour and the Lib Dems about How best to get rid of the Tories at the next election? Because it seems to me the country is desperate to get rid of the Tories, but the system is not going to make that easy. The system doesn't make it easy. The system drives people into tribal ways of doing things, and we compete for people's votes Up and down the country. So, you know, you're right. It's it's a it's an uphill thing to try and rest on cooperation. I think I've been involved in evolution for the whole of 20 years. I was an adviser to Robert Morgan Mhmm. From the very beginning. I do feel one of the things I have spent 20 years doing sometimes is trying to remind my own colleagues, but the fault line on the floor of the senate is between progressive parties on one hand and the Tories on the other. That is the fundamental fault line, We shouldn't act as a Labour Party on the floor of the senate in ways that drives some of the more progressive voices Closer to the Tories because we don't appear willing to be able to talk with them, explain with them, learn from them, all of those things. Yeah. A fundamental thought down in Wales is between the 3 quarters of the electorate who vote for parties of the center left And the quarter of the Welsh electorate that votes for the conservative party. And, you know, that's the fault line we should be working on. People who are on the non Now you you're meant to be a famous example of this kind of Technical thing of avoiding prosocification, which is, this horrible jargon word for listeners who are not Staying on top of it for PASOC, the the the Greek left wing party which managed to get wiped out, went from having almost half the vote Almost no vote at all in in a few years, half a dozen years. What lessons should we draw about what happened to Labour In the Red Wall, what happened to Labour in Scotland but didn't happen to Labour in Wales? And I'm gonna challenge you to try to be a bit bit Less political. You're being quite polite all the time. But if you had some He's a very polite man. That's one of the reasons why he's popular in Wales, Rory. But some reflections on what went wrong in the Red Wall, what went wrong in Scotland, lost the SNP in Scotland, lost to the Tories in Northern England. Well, Rory, because I'm often asked, and, you know, I'm gonna answer it the way I always do, which is that I'm never here to teach other people lessons. I'm very happy to share the watch experience. And sometimes there will be things in in that that other people will find useful, and they can They can draw on it. I don't approach it on the basis, and we have done things that, you know, allow us to tell other people what to do. But in November of this year, it will be 100 years since Labour first won a majority in the general election in Wales, And we've never not done that since. Oh, in happy days. Happy days. Happy country. And, During the the conservative party has never won an election in Wales ever, ever since 18/32 and the onset of, you know, universal suffrage. The 19th century was dominated by the Liberal Party, the 20th century, by the Labour Party. So I'm very lucky. You know? I'm But but, Mark, just to interrupt, that that also, Broadly speaking is true of Northern England and Scotland. Again, the same shift from Liberals to Labour. The conservatives were never dominant forces in Northern England or Scotland. Well, actually, that's not true, Zivory, is it? You know, if we're just trying to be accurate about it, the Tories won elections in Scotland in 19 fifties. They were not a dominant force. They were not a dominant force over the century. That was a very exceptional result. That was a small exceptional result. Primarily, Scotland has been on the left. Yeah. Primarily, but not exclusively. And Wales is the only party part of the United Kingdom where exclusively That would be true. Now why have we come why we managed to continue to do that? Well, here are here are 3 or 4 qualities, which I think, you know, have helped to that. 1st of all, just hard work. Let's not forget forget. You know, I would I do a little turn sometimes when I'm talking for the Labour Party's. Let's say, you know, People get attracted into the Labour Party because it's 90% inspiration. You know, they want to achieve something. They think this is the way to do it and 10% perspiration. When you get into it, most of politics is, you know, perspiration, and just the the sheer slog of making sure that you're always talking to people, you're knocking doors, you're Answering the phone, you're having those conversations, and we're very lucky in Wales that we are the only party who is able to put people out on the streets to do that Work and we earn every vote we get. Now I want nobody to say to me they vote labor because they've always voted labor Well, because their father would turn in his grave if they didn't vote labor. I want people to vote labor because we have persuaded them. We go on, you know, convincing them that that's The right thing to do, we earn the votes that we that we have. I think we're very lucky because we've been in power, Then we have credibility when we say to people at an election that this is these are the things we would like to do for them Because we are able to show them that we've done those things already. You know, the fact that you can point to your record and say, we told you last time this is what we would do. And look. Here's how we did it. Gives us a credibility with our voters that is much harder to do when you're in opposition. So so, Mark, let let let me let me let me Titan my question. Why do you think Labour voters voted conservative in Northern England? I think there were a constellation of circumstances that meant that that was happening happening in Wales as well. We lost seats, the whole Brexit fatigue, the Entirely false claim that there was a deal that would just get Brexit done. But to go back to my point about earning votes and showing people respect. I think sometimes in some parts of the country, Labor has been in danger of looking like we don't really like the people who vote for us. But, they vote for us, but we don't you know, Well, it's like you're saying faced about the support that we get, and I never want that to be true in Wales. Do Do do do do you mean by that, Mark, that you think there were parts of the country where we just assumed that people would vote Labour because they always had done, and we didn't really take their interest into account, whether that was over cost of standard of living or immigration or some of the language and style of politics. What do you mean what do you mean by that? Well, I'm afraid people got that impression. Whether it was true or not, I'm sure they were very hardworking people, you know, representing those areas for labor who went at all that. But, somehow, we we conveyed the impression to people. We we took for granted the fact that they would vote for us. Mhmm. And we weren't always backing to To show how proud we were that we had earned that that support and proud of them. And, you know, I am proud of every Every person of our today, very well. So so, Mark, just to be cheeky, if if this was Alastair a few weeks ago, he would say, if you look at the records since 1980, Elections basically go, Tory, Tory, Tory, Tony Blair, Tory, Tory, Tory, Tory, Tory, And the conclusion that one might draw from that is that the lesson for Labour is that it needs to be much more New Labour, much more Tony Blair, And that's not your tradition, so I wonder what you'd answer to that challenge. I'm not sure I'd put it exactly like that, by the way. Let me give you 2 other qualities which I think have helped us, in our success, and the one links to what I've just been saying, which is identity. To be watched and to be labor are 2 identities that sit on top of one another very comfortably, And we work hard to make sure that we sustain that. And, you know, I think we have to work harder in some places To say to people to be a labor supporter somewhere, you know, it's an identity that works for your locality and for your tone. Mhmm. You know, to be labor in Luton is an identity that tells you that the Labour Party is interested in on the side of Keen to represent the people who live in that area. So identity, I think, is a very important component in our success. Margie, Margie, was that not once the case in Scotland. I mean, I can remember, you know, growing up from a very Scottish family. That was felt to be what, you know, people felt Scottish and Labour, and those 2 identities were very much it Felt the same. I mean, could you ever envisage a period in history where that might disappear in Wales? And what do you do to guard against that? Well, I can imagine it because I've seen this happen in Scotland. And, you know, I we worked very hard indeed to say to people that you don't have to Show your Welsh by voting for a nationalist party. You can reaffirm your Welsh identity by voting for Welsh labor because we are as Welsh as you are and determined that that identity goes on being part of the relationship between you and us. And then my final point, and this goes more to Rory's question, is that I think we try and speak In a voice and with a set of policies that are all authentically labor as well. That will be clear to somebody who's interested But these ideas and the way we talk about them comes out to that labor tradition. I do think that people respond to, You know, a sense of authenticity about a political party, and sometimes that will mean saying things that you know not everybody will agree with. But they are what you believe in, and you are there to talk about the things that you believe in and to make the case for them and to do that with that sense of authenticity. And I think that has been on our side as well. Did you think that we we knew Labour as it were under Tony Blair went too Bar in that kind of neoliberal pro globalization private sector direction, and that that started to send confusing signals about what labor is and what lay what labor, to use your word, authentically is. I think what is authentically labor in Wales, You know, is different. So what is going to appeal to people elsewhere where there isn't the same tradition and the same sort of class structure and so on? You you may remember, also, Rodri gave a lecture early on in devolution, which I have to admit to having Having had a hand in writing for him, which talked about clear red water. I do remember it. And, that was trying to Set out, you know, a distinctive agenda for labor in Wales, which was not part of marketization, Not part of a sense that, you know, the way you improve public services was by allowing people to become serial shoppers, so choice Agenda and so on. No. That is not because he or I believed that that was the right prescription for elsewhere in the kingdom, but we knew that those things would resonate, with people who look to the Labour Party in words. But, Mark, some of These things are national. I mean, you're opposed to Triton, right, when Keir Starmer's in favourite Triton? That's not particularly Welsh, that's a, that's a global nuclear weapon. I mean, that's, So you're taking positions on things that go well beyond the traditions of a particular part of the United Kingdom? Yeah. Of course, we all have long histories of, views, and that was my view and is my view, but it's not part of what I do as the first minister of whales because I have no responsibilities, in that field. And, you know, I do my best to Spend my time working on the things for which the Senev and myself as first minister have responsibility, and I Try while I'm doing this job, you know, not to get drawn into debates about things that other people have to discharge Because the responsibilities belong to them, but it doesn't mean that my own ideas and, you know, my own beliefs have changed. Mark, if if Scotland did, become independent or if we did have a United Ireland and Northern Ireland became part of the republic. I know these are both massive ifs. But if you would sort of rank them in order, I think that the likelihood of Northern Ireland border poll is probably 1st, and I think then an independent Scotland probably 2nd. But How does Wales how does Wales shape a future then as as sort of this bit on the end of England? And I don't mean that disrespectfully, but, I mean, that That could happen. I just wonder how you think about that. Well, those are really important questions, and we're having to address them directly in a way that we never needed to do previously, and that's because I think, you know, the risk of the United Kingdom will not continue is greater today than at any time in my political lifetime. I certainly don't think it's inevitable. I think there is an offer about the United Kingdom. It's a labor offer, in my view that people would wish to buy into. You know, they would see the advantages that the United Kingdom can bring, and we are desperately short of an articulation by any other party of the positive case for a voluntary union. We have had to set up a a commission. It's chaired by Rowan Williams and by someone called Laura McAllister, who's a distinguished professor here in Wales. It's asked to look at 2 questions. First of all, If the United Kingdom stays together, how can we better organize ourselves to make sure that it goes on being a success? But But then it has a second question, which is that if the United Kingdom starts not to stay together, what are the options for Wales? Because the idea that's, you know, everything else Continue Scotland leaves, and everything else continues as though that haven't happened. It's clearly not plausible at all, but we've never needed to do serious thinking about what the choices for Wales would be, and the commission will help us to do that. But we're having to map out that territory with a seriousness But, I think just reflects the risks that we we currently face. Mhmm. How would you define the independence debate right now? In Wales, it's still very much a minority view. You know, we in our election in May of last year, it had the virtue of We are clarity about it. You know, I would stand on, platforms that the the debates at the BBC will be broadcasting. I would have somebody on my right who believed in abolishing the evolution altogether. And the BBC gave me core prominence despite the fact they've never Won a single seat in any election, but there they were as though they were already poor player. And on my left, it would be Adam Price, the leader by Connery, Absolutely, explicitly for the election on the basis that the vote for him was a vote for independence. And, you know, I was the advocate of, as I say, strong and entrenched devolution in a successful United Kingdom, and there's no doubt at all with the center of gravity In Welsh opinion lines, there is a growing interest in independence because of the risks that are there to the future of the United Kingdom. That's Inevitable, but it would still be a of a small minority, but no more than 20% or so. Can I just ask you briefly about COVID? Your your profile and the profile of of devolution rose during COVID, And there were certain things that you did very differently. But, ultimately, the UK government does control the purse purse strings. And I just wonder how you feel about the way that the post Brexit you were Brexit minister in the Welsh government, how the post Brexit, strategy, insofar as there is one, that the UK government impinges upon you and whether you fear that, ultimately, You end up having to impose austerity whether you like it or not, because of that relationship and and how you get around that politically given that we are going into what looks like being an incredibly challenging time economically. Well, we continue to struggle with Brexit Every day, its adverse impacts, on whales are palpable, and it doesn't have to be like this. So, You know, I would have preferred that we stayed inside the European Union altogether. But once a decision was made, I've always believed it was possible to devise a set of circumstances in which we would have left the political side of the union, but we would have continued to have had access to the single market, part of the customs union, defended our economic interests In that way, and, you know, we we desperately need a government who believes in working alongside our European partners rather than A constant, pattern of provocation. But on the issue of austerity, you know, we've had a decade of austerity. We've had a decade of austerity. I was very proud to knock doors in Wales during the 2017 election, for example, because they've got manifesto contained so many things that we were already doing in Wales. We promised free prescriptions. We've had them since 2003, we said that we would reinstate education maintenance allowances. We've never abolished them in Wales. We said that we would store nurse bursaries. We've kept them in Wales. You know, I could list a whole string of things for you that we managed to do Within the budget that the Tory government gives to us, we do that by making the choices that we would make as a Labour government. We prioritize the things that we think, you know, leave money in people's pockets so that they can manage the other parts of their lives, and we do it, you know, in the conditions of austerity. So that will become more difficult. Okay. Yeah. But, you know, in the end, You have political choices to make. You said there you talked about the the the damage that Brexit is doing, the the consequences being palpable. Do you not share my frustration that the Labour Party nationally still seems to sort of have this great elephant in the room. They don't really want to talk about those consequences. And if Labour's strategy is to be a strategy of growth, as Keir Starmer keeps saying, Surely, there has to be a much more open debate about how we deal with those consequences. Well, Brexit is a is a frightening, topic for politicians because of its divisive nature, and you don't want to reopen old wounds and just spend your whole time trying to, you know, repair again, that damage, I am absolutely sure that, you know, the next Labour government will take a very different view, not on Brexit itself. That's done, sadly. We're you know, We could just face up to that, but we'll take a very different view to how we conduct our relations with our nearest and most important partners. Yeah. Most importantly, economically, we will want to have a cooperative set of relationships, with, again, based on Mutual respect, but we'll recognize that the interest of Welsh farmers are not served by Trade deals far flung on the other side of the world, but are in allowing Welsh farmers to be able to export They're fantastic produce to people in the Southern Mediterranean who were our biggest customers and who now Can't buy from Wales because by the time the food gets there, it's no longer fresh or fit to sell. No. We we we we're coming to the end of the time, and thanks For giving us so much of your time. I'm sorry for the technical hitches at the start. But before I maybe give Roy the final question, I just want to give my final question. You have said that you'd step down during this term, I e, before 2026. Is that a definitive done deal? Well, I haven't changed my mind. I think one of the one of the things that, you know, has helped, really, is that I try and answer if I ask them as best I can. And it was always my plan, really, that by the time I was halfway through this So, Tom, I'll be nearly 70 years old by then. It's not just me, but it it would be true. There will be, it would be right, You know, to hand on to somebody who has the next 20 years in their sights. We've done that very successfully in Wales. You know, Cadwin handed on to, Rodri handed on to Cadwin during a term. Cadwin handed on to me during a term. I plan to do The same somewhere in the second half of this term. Mark, thank you so much for for coming on. Last little one for me. Do you feel that being in politics damages people? I I felt it was terrible for my mind, my body, my soul. I think I cease To be a proper human being, I ended up talking to people as though they were voters all the time. Do you think it's had any impact on your character? Well, I'm a politician by accident Rather than by design, I never set out to do what I do now. Does it change, how you are? Well, inevitably, it does, doesn't it? Because it's not possible for me in Wales, at least, to go anywhere Incognito. If you're out, there will be people who can up to you. They want to talk to you. They want to share their views. On the whole, as you know, most people are astonishingly I liked, you know, just genuinely interested in wanting to have those, encounters with you, and You have to regard that as part of the privilege of the job. My wife went to 10 b, you know, Big Wash tourist place, recently without me and came back and said how glad she was to that I wasn't there. And she didn't mean that in a vastly made to me. She just meant that she was able to go and just do what she wanted to do without just being stopped Every few yards by people wanting wanting to talk, it does change you. It doesn't have to change you for the worse. You know, you just have to Regard it, as I say, as part of the privilege of the job that you do. And final final final question, Mark. Have you kept up your Latin? I'm fascinated by people who study Latin to the extent that you did. Yeah. Well, I I tried to a little bit, and I only ever managed to do it in the summer. One of the things that I promised myself in the summer when I have a chance is, I will spend if I'm walking, which I'm trying to do a fair bit about, And I will learn some poetry as I go along. It's about keeping you mind busy. And I I will occasionally go back and find some piece of catalactos or something and, Remind myself about it and try and commit it as best I can to, to my memory. Well, thank you for your talk, Gagees. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope you have. Thank you very much. And we'll maybe do it again another day. All the best. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Bye bye. So, Alastair, what did you think of that? I really enjoyed that. I thought he was frank. Obviously, he is he is a politician. He's the 1st minister, and he's not going to dive into really difficult areas where he doesn't necessarily want to make news. But I I I thought he was very thoughtful, reflective, and, yeah, I enjoyed it. So, Alison, one of the things that I thought was fascinating was just this little glimpse into, I mean, obviously, I I was obsessed with it. So this kind of glimpse into Labour politics, the seventies eighties, these kind of big big characters, because there were a lot of them in in Cumbria too. Going a long way back, there was a guy called lord Adams of Ennadale, Jack Adams, who was the kind of great hero of Cumbria in the 19 thirties, 19 forties, brought a lot of the money in, got a lot of the projects going, but quite kind of some of their reputation, quite kind of authoritarian, quite autocratic in the way they ran Oh, there are. Absolutely. Absolutely. And that I I thought I mean, that style of politics has been very common, throughout the UK, various periods of history. I used to love listening to Neil Kinnock talk about some of the big characters in Welsh politics. And, now I thought I thought he was very he he does have a it's interesting you said to him about, you know, he was very polite. He does come across as being very mild mannered. Yeah. Well, it's it's a brilliant technique, isn't it? It's a brilliant political technique because what he can do is he can sort of be Very gently truthful and hinted his views without really creating a story. So clearly, he's massively left wing, but he's got He had a very elegant line to that, didn't he? Well, you know, was my views from the past? Then he concedes it is my view now, but Lady doesn't have any more responsibility, is it? Responsibility. Yeah. Yeah. But I thought I thought in as you know, I thought he handled the, you know because it's true. When we were At number 10, and I can remember, Roderick Morgan was a great character. He really was. He used to he used to turn up for his meetings with Tony Blair. I remember one of them. He turned up Literally carrying his papers at a Tesco shopping bag. And so it's just he was a very I really liked Rodriep, but he But and Mark was I remember Mark was responsible for that. He drove that strategy of what you call clear red water, of of being different. And that could be a bit irritating for us because, you know, you you you're at the you're sitting there at the center. You think you're all powerful. Tony Blair's the leader of the Labour Party, the prime minister, and You've got these guys, Danny Wells, sort of it feels a little bit like, you know, potshots. But, actually, when you hear him explain it as he did there, You can see the the rationale. You can see the strategy behind it. Worked out for them, didn't it? Didn't it? And I I just love the fact that we have part of our United Kingdom, which is being so trashed by These people, the conservatives. And we've got this part of the United Kingdom, which has had a labor in power for a century. It's a wonderful, wonderful story. I also wonder whether the lesson that maybe he's trying to draw, but he's too polite to say, is that if Scottish Labour had been prepared to be more courageously left wing And maybe Northern Labour being prepared to be more courageously left wing. They wouldn't be in the situation they're in now. But to hold those bases, they needed to stick hard on the left. Yeah. Possibly saying that. I think he was also saying that the you see, I think the the other thing, in Scotland, so many of our big national figures have come from Scotland. And look, plenty of national big national figures have come from Wales as well, but I think he was he was maybe saying There was too much of focus in in the UK Labour Party, the Scottish politicians on the UK, whereas he was saying there were a lot of Welsh politicians who really, really focused on Wales. Yeah. But I thought he I can see why I can see why he remains popular even on the basis of my chat. I'm with you. The other thing I would have had a go at him on if I'd if I'd thought I'd make any Progress on it. But as you say, he's too polite and smooth to do it. Is this question of all these devolved governments? It's true of Sadiq Khan as mayor of London too, which is that they are in these very odd positions because they don't have much control over a lot of things. And that allows them to blame the conservative government for a lot of stuff without having full responsibility for it. It's quite a kinda clever thing to be in. So they can take the credit for anything that goes well. And anything goes badly, they can say that's not our fault. It's the fault of the other lot. Politics, Rory. It's called politics. Yeah. Well but can you ever solve that with devolution? Because it it makes accountability quite difficult. I remember, you know, with Tsidikhan trying to say signalling's not being done up on the Piccadilly line since the you know, I was doing so in independence, since 19 seventies And knife crime's rising, and you're meant to be responsible for transport and housing and crime. But the answer was always Tory cuts. Yeah. And and it is. And, also, there's no doubt at all that the the Johnson government has had a strategy for trying to undermine Sadiq Khan that has included targeting the funding of some of the things that he that he is responsible for. I just think that's the that's why these relationships do matter. And I do think that I mean, again, he was he was even Mark was even very polite about his relations with with Boris Johnson. He clearly can't stand the guy. Yeah. You know, that was that was pretty peculiar, wasn't it? Very polite about Boris Johnson. Very polite. He he made it absolutely clear Johnson showed no respect whatsoever. One wonders, yeah, one wonders around the dinner table what Actually, he thinks about Boris Johnson or even of Tony Blair. Indeed. Indeed. Well, we know what he talked about thought about Boris Johnson because he was caught on camera in one of those fly on the wall documentaries saying how awful he was. Anyway, I enjoyed that. I'm glad to be",

To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show tickets. Just go to the rest is politics .com. That's the rest is politics .com.\n\nNow we're delighted to have an interview with the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, And please don't be too surprised if we don't talk about the queen or king Charles because the interview was conducted shortly before the sad demise of her majesty. Welcome to The Rest is Politics with me, Alastair Campbell\n\nSpeaker 1: and me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And a very special guest, we are absolutely delighted to welcome the 1st minister of Wales, Mark Greatford. Mark, hello, and thank you for being here.\n\nSpeaker 2: Very pleased to be here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now can I kick off? Because every time I read about you in any sort of profile piece, the word, Corbynista, gets attached to you, and I can see from the Grievous that that probably irritates you a bit. But I just wanna get a sense of your politics. If if we accept that Jeremy Is, say, on the left of the party, and my old boss, Tony, is on the right of the party. Where are you putting yourself adjacent or between them?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I think in my own politics as being derived from the radical Welsh tradition. And, you know, that can go back as far as Lloyd George and gets handed down The generations via Bevan, Michael Foote, Neil Kinnock. It's that strand in Welsh politics, Which is to the left of the center, but, you know, all of politics in Wales is to the left of where it would be across the United Kingdom. And insofar as I think of myself as belonging to a tradition, it is to that sort of radical strand in Bosch politics.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, Mark, can you help help me on this because I'm obviously a an ex Tory talking to you and a lot of this is is alien to me and I'm trying to understand the world she grew up in. So You're you're somebody who's been described as an atheist republican socialist. Is that is that roughly true?\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not brave enough to be an atheist. I'm an, I'm an agnostic. Oh, good. But, the other things would be true.\n\nSpeaker 1: The other things would be true. And when you were growing up, it was a very dominant figure, actually, even when you were an adult because you came, I think, into elected politics surprisingly late. We're in a world where, most of the last lot of prime ministers have gotten in their forties, early fifties. I think you didn't become an elected member till you were in your late fifties, did you? You had a whole Separate career as an academic universities.\n\nBut I've noticed this this big figure called Jack Brooks who seems to dominate a lot of talking about the early eighties in Wales and I'd love a sense of what Labour politics in Wales felt like in the late seventies, early eighties when you were beginning to get involved, what kind of character he was And how it's changed? I mean, how would Jack Brooks think about the Welsh Labour Party if he was to turn up today? Maybe you could tell this. It's a bit about Jack Brooks before you tell us a little bit Answer that question.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Well, I became a counselor in my twenties. Jack was the leader of South Morgan Council during the time that I was a councilor, so I certainly saw him a very close quarters. He was in if you've contrasted modern politics to the politics that Jack grew up in. And it was pretty much a sort of male dominated, probably boss led Solo politics, you know, where big beasts dominated local councils across Wales.\n\nSpeaker 1: And was he a boxer? He if you're interested in boxing, wasn't he?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. No. He was. He's a plasterer, by, by training.\n\nIf you if you wanted to Learn something about him. I'll I'll tell you a story that he used to tell, which was going out to a young man in his, You know, early twenties to a nightclub in Cardiff. He's all dressed up. He's ready for a night out. He sees a young woman, across the floor, and she's looking at him.\n\nAnd, you know, he thinks, well, my mind could be turning up a bit, here. And, you know, she comes across the floor, Tim, and says to him, oh, you're Jack Brooks, aren't you? And you think you definitely think tonight is getting better. And she says to him, you're the kid who used to have free school meals. And I think it's that sort of experience, really, which shaped Hey.\n\nOne would have shaped many other people in the Labour Party. You know, that sense that people are not to be shaped by their other gyms And that the job of the party is to provide the chances for people to be able to make the very most of their talents and their abilities.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just one more sort of push at this before I bring back Alastair. Help us understand the idea of a a sort of boss figure in Early eighties politics, but it's not too sensitive. Maybe this is too sensitive. Maybe you're gonna be offending Labour Party listeners by talking too frankly about this. But I saw a glimpse of this in politics in Scotland in the in the nineties when things really felt as though they were run by bosses.\n\nWhat what did that feel like in terms of how things were run and operated?\n\nSpeaker 2: Shall I tell you a story that appeared in the Guardian obituary of lord Haycock?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, lord Haycock ran the old Glamorgan County Council, and, you know, nothing moved Without, lord Haycock having ordained that he should move, and the story in the obituary was of 2 Jehovah's Witnesses, knocking the door of his home that's outside Port Talbot. And, lady Hiccup comes to the door, and the 2 Jehovah's Witnesses Say to her, does the lord dwell in this house? To which she is alleged to have replied, yes. He does, but he's out watching at the moment. And, I think that might give you just a flavor of what it was like to be a dominant figure in Welsh local governments.\n\nA long time ago now. It's very different. So\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think we we've talked on when we we did a a special episode recently about when Liz Truss was made prime minister, and we were Talking about the fact there have been now 3 conservative women prime ministers, do you think that, historically, the male dominance of the Labour Party and the trade union movement has has been part of legacy that has made it more difficult for labor to find a woman prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I think it is part of our our history, But we are capable of amending it. You know, I lead a labor group in the senate, which is 17 women and 13 men In it, there are 5 women in my cabinets and 4 men and women fill all the major sorts of, ministerial Physicians are not in any way confined to what you might have thought as the traditional, responsibilities that women would undertake. So, You know, that is a very steep change to the sort of world in which, you know, my early experience of labor politics in Wales Would have been shaped. So we are capable of amending our own history, and we need to go on doing that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now we don't wanna talk too much about the Richard Boris Johnson, But I got the sense of your relationship with him being very, very difficult. What do you think the relationship between the first minister of Wales The UK prime minister should be, and what hopes do you have for a better relationship with Liz Truss and how realistic doing that is?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, the fundamental word is that it Needs to be respectful. So I go to the series of, you know, different prime ministers, including conservative prime ministers. And I think there was a very big contrast between relations with Theresa May when she was prime minister and with her Success. I disagreed with missus May on almost anything you'd like to say and, you know, was terribly frustrated at what I thought was her fundamental Mistake in regarding Brexit as a winner takes all, sort of referendum. But I would describe her as an instinctive democrat.\n\nIf you were in a room with her and she was prime minister, she would make a conscious effort to make sure that Anybody in the room who had a view they wanted to contribute had an opportunity to contribute to that view. And, you know, that is a sort of instinctive respect for The range of different individuals and experiences that you will you will come across. So I think it is perfectly possible to have Good, effective, constructive working relationships with people who are in a different party from you and occupy a different position. But it's got to be founded on a basic sense of respect and parity of participation. You know, Wales is a small country.\n\nIt is not the same as a country the size of England, but parity of participation is something different. You know, every voice has a right to be heard and to be treated respectfully.\n\nSpeaker 0: And you felt that Johnson didn't treat you with respect?\n\nSpeaker 2: On an individual level, on the rare occasions that I had direct conversations with mister Johnson, he, you know, he he was courteous. He He wasn't disrespectful in that way, but his approach to the future of the United Kingdom was very different. You know, Theresa May in the final lecture in Edinburgh described the United Kingdom as a voluntary association of 4 nations. I think that was, you know, the end of quite a long journey probably for her. Boris Johnson believed that the way to save the United Kingdom was to, you know, assert muscular unionism.\n\nMhmm. Holy boy Britain, as you might, more pejoratively put it in which The way to secure the future of the United Kingdom is to show who is boss, and, actually, that was completely counterproductive and contributes to the fragility of the United Kingdom Rather than helping it to be something which people choose to belong to, want to belong to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I come in quickly on this? You're somebody who describes yourself as a a federalist or a unionist, but I guess there were some people who were quite Shocked to to see you, as it were, get into bed with Plaid Comrie and I I wondered whether That was something that gave you any moments for pause or reflection before you did it?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, it could only be shocking to somebody outside Wales. You know, my party's been in power, in Wales throughout the history of devolution, but we've never won more than 30 of the 60 seats on offer. So we have always had to work with other individuals and other parties in order to be able to get the job Done. We had a full coalition with, like, coming in 2007 where Rodri Morgan, one of my predecessors, was the 1st minister. What we have learned is as a party in Wales is that working with other progressive parties is not something to regard as Unusual or difficult.\n\nIt's challenging, but it can be done. And we've demonstrated that it can be done, and The current cooperation we have with Placomery is designed to allow us to deliver on the most radical parts of our agenda, things which I think are very difficult to do if you're a party on your own and certainly a party that has only half the seats available. So I I know at the UK level, the idea of working across parties is regarded as, you know, somehow a failure of the system.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. No. No. No.\n\nLet me push back a little bit, Mark. It's not not that I mean, I was part of a coalition with Lib Dems. I think it's the problem of working with a party that's explicitly committed to independence.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, obviously, I fundamentally disagree with them on that point. I believe in strong and entrenched Devolution where decisions are made as close to people as possible. But I also believe that the United Kingdom is better off for having Wales in it, and Wales is better off of being in the United Kingdom, but that's because we choose to belong to it because we think there are important purposes that we discharge better together. Well, I disagree with Paul Connery, on that, and we fought an election only a year or so ago where that choice was very explicitly with people. That doesn't mean that there aren't very important things that we are able to agree on and can work together, I'll be able to see it, you know, for the benefit of the people who have elected us.\n\nSpeaker 0: We had we had Keir Starmer on the podcast a a few weeks ago, And he I think he disappointed both of us really in that he didn't seem to share our belief that politics was now Potentially so broken that there has to be at least a debate about some pretty major political and constitutional change. And to be fair, you have been pushing out some ideas for further reform of the constitution and further form reform of of democracy. Do you not think that Labour nationally is, Across the UK is missing a bit of a trick in playing into this worry about the state of our politics rather than actually defending the status quo.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I think, Kirsten Martin did a very important thing in commissioning Gordon Brown to lead a piece of work which will Range over, you know, a series of these really important constitutional questions. I've had the chance to, stay very close to the work Of the commission, I was talking to Gordon about it last week. I think when it is published, you know, it will set out the prospectus for labor That will give us the the arguments that are needed and the rigor of, debate behind it. But, well, I think, you know, be provide quite a radical perspectives For the future of the United Kingdom. I have to say, I I'm never interested in constitutional questions because they are constitutional questions.\n\nI'm interested in them because they are the way in which we are better able to solve the problems that face people in their daily lives. That's why we should be interested in them because they give us the basis for doing that.\n\nSpeaker 1: To take take one example then, I mean, one one of the problems that we certainly feel in Westminster is That the existing parties feel very, very tired and one of the reasons why certainly I support proportional representation is to give room for new, fresher parties to emerge, to break up some of those old structures, to give voters a chance, To be a bit more entrepreneurial and maybe to provide a bit of challenge to some of those old stuffy parties and make them step up their game rather than assuming that They can continue to have a 2 party dominance. So looking at the horror of the last, decade or more And the way how stultified Westminster politics feels. I would have thought proportional representation is a real solution to a problem. It's not constitutional change for its own sake.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I I work in a proportional system. You know, the senate is elected, under a system of PR, and we have proposals to reform The way the senate is, elected that would make it even more, proportional. So I have no problem at all with that argument. You know, I I'm a bit heretical. I've Said it in the past, but, I think you can make a good argument for saying that administrations that have people From more than 1 tradition in in them have a level of internal challenge.\n\nThat means by the time you come to put your ideas in front of the wider Electorate. They are better ideas because they've already had to be tested with people who don't come at the problems in exactly the same way as you do or your party does. So, in terms of trying to, you know, not have a certified narrow debate that just sticks Within the parameters, I think our experience in Wales in which, you know, in every election, we've had to work with other people. The challenge that brings with it is actually good for democracy and, I think, improves the quality of policymaking.\n\nSpeaker 0: If would would you not be happy If you felt that there was actually quite a lot of cooperation right now between Labour and the Lib Dems about How best to get rid of the Tories at the next election? Because it seems to me the country is desperate to get rid of the Tories, but the system is not going to make that easy.\n\nSpeaker 2: The system doesn't make it easy. The system drives people into tribal ways of doing things, and we compete for people's votes Up and down the country. So, you know, you're right. It's it's a it's an uphill thing to try and rest on cooperation. I think I've been involved in evolution for the whole of 20 years.\n\nI was an adviser to Robert Morgan Mhmm. From the very beginning. I do feel one of the things I have spent 20 years doing sometimes is trying to remind my own colleagues, but the fault line on the floor of the senate is between progressive parties on one hand and the Tories on the other. That is the fundamental fault line, We shouldn't act as a Labour Party on the floor of the senate in ways that drives some of the more progressive voices Closer to the Tories because we don't appear willing to be able to talk with them, explain with them, learn from them, all of those things. Yeah.\n\nA fundamental thought down in Wales is between the 3 quarters of the electorate who vote for parties of the center left And the quarter of the Welsh electorate that votes for the conservative party. And, you know, that's the fault line we should be working on. People who are on\n\nSpeaker 0: the non\n\nSpeaker 1: Now you you're meant to be a famous example of this kind of Technical thing of avoiding prosocification, which is, this horrible jargon word for listeners who are not Staying on top of it for PASOC, the the the Greek left wing party which managed to get wiped out, went from having almost half the vote Almost no vote at all in in a few years, half a dozen years. What lessons should we draw about what happened to Labour In the Red Wall, what happened to Labour in Scotland but didn't happen to Labour in Wales? And I'm gonna challenge you to try to be a bit bit Less political. You're being quite polite all the time. But if you had some He's\n\nSpeaker 0: a very polite man. That's one of the reasons why he's popular in Wales, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: But some reflections on what went wrong in the Red Wall, what went wrong in Scotland, lost the SNP in Scotland, lost to the Tories in Northern England.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Rory, because I'm often asked, and, you know, I'm gonna answer it the way I always do, which is that I'm never here to teach other people lessons. I'm very happy to share the watch experience. And sometimes there will be things in in that that other people will find useful, and they can They can draw on it. I don't approach it on the basis, and we have done things that, you know, allow us to tell other people what to do. But in November of this year, it will be 100 years since Labour first won a majority in the general election in Wales, And we've never not done that since.\n\nOh, in\n\nSpeaker 0: happy days. Happy days. Happy country.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, During the the conservative party has never won an election in Wales ever, ever since 18/32 and the onset of, you know, universal suffrage. The 19th century was dominated by the Liberal Party, the 20th century, by the Labour Party. So I'm very lucky. You know? I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: But but, Mark, just to interrupt, that that also, Broadly speaking is true of Northern England and Scotland. Again, the same shift from Liberals to Labour. The conservatives were never dominant forces in Northern England or Scotland.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, actually, that's not true, Zivory, is it? You know, if we're just trying to be accurate about it, the Tories won elections in Scotland in 19 fifties.\n\nSpeaker 1: They were not a dominant force. They were not a dominant force over the century. That was a very exceptional result. That was a small exceptional result. Primarily, Scotland has been on the left.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Primarily, but not exclusively. And Wales is the only party part of the United Kingdom where exclusively That would be true. Now why have we come why we managed to continue to do that? Well, here are here are 3 or 4 qualities, which I think, you know, have helped to that.\n\n1st of all, just hard work. Let's not forget forget. You know, I would I do a little turn sometimes when I'm talking for the Labour Party's. Let's say, you know, People get attracted into the Labour Party because it's 90% inspiration. You know, they want to achieve something.\n\nThey think this is the way to do it and 10% perspiration. When you get into it, most of politics is, you know, perspiration, and just the the sheer slog of making sure that you're always talking to people, you're knocking doors, you're Answering the phone, you're having those conversations, and we're very lucky in Wales that we are the only party who is able to put people out on the streets to do that Work and we earn every vote we get. Now I want nobody to say to me they vote labor because they've always voted labor Well, because their father would turn in his grave if they didn't vote labor. I want people to vote labor because we have persuaded them. We go on, you know, convincing them that that's The right thing to do, we earn the votes that we that we have.\n\nI think we're very lucky because we've been in power, Then we have credibility when we say to people at an election that this is these are the things we would like to do for them Because we are able to show them that we've done those things already. You know, the fact that you can point to your record and say, we told you last time this is what we would do. And look. Here's how we did it. Gives us a credibility with our voters that is much harder to do when you're in opposition.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so, Mark, let let let me let me let me Titan my question. Why do you think Labour voters voted conservative in Northern England?\n\nSpeaker 2: I think there were a constellation of circumstances that meant that that was happening happening in Wales as well. We lost seats, the whole Brexit fatigue, the Entirely false claim that there was a deal that would just get Brexit done. But to go back to my point about earning votes and showing people respect. I think sometimes in some parts of the country, Labor has been in danger of looking like we don't really like the people who vote for us. But, they vote for us, but we don't you know, Well, it's like you're saying faced about the support that we get, and I never want that to be true in Wales.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do Do do do do you mean by that, Mark, that you think there were parts of the country where we just assumed that people would vote Labour because they always had done, and we didn't really take their interest into account, whether that was over cost of standard of living or immigration or some of the language and style of politics. What do you mean what do you mean by that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm afraid people got that impression. Whether it was true or not, I'm sure they were very hardworking people, you know, representing those areas for labor who went at all that. But, somehow, we we conveyed the impression to people. We we took for granted the fact that they would vote for us. Mhmm.\n\nAnd we weren't always backing to To show how proud we were that we had earned that that support and proud of them. And, you know, I am proud of every Every person of our today, very well.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so, Mark, just to be cheeky, if if this was Alastair a few weeks ago, he would say, if you look at the records since 1980, Elections basically go, Tory, Tory, Tory, Tony Blair, Tory, Tory, Tory, Tory, Tory, And the conclusion that one might draw from that is that the lesson for Labour is that it needs to be much more New Labour, much more Tony Blair, And that's not your tradition, so I wonder what you'd answer to that challenge.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm not sure I'd put it exactly like that, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 2: Let me give you 2 other qualities which I think have helped us, in our success, and the one links to what I've just been saying, which is identity. To be watched and to be labor are 2 identities that sit on top of one another very comfortably, And we work hard to make sure that we sustain that. And, you know, I think we have to work harder in some places To say to people to be a labor supporter somewhere, you know, it's an identity that works for your locality and for your tone. Mhmm. You know, to be labor in Luton is an identity that tells you that the Labour Party is interested in on the side of Keen to represent the people who live in that area.\n\nSo identity, I think, is a very important component in\n\nSpeaker 0: our success. Margie, Margie, was that not once the case in Scotland. I mean, I can remember, you know, growing up from a very Scottish family. That was felt to be what, you know, people felt Scottish and Labour, and those 2 identities were very much it Felt the same. I mean, could you ever envisage a period in history where that might disappear in Wales?\n\nAnd what do you do to guard against that?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I can imagine it because I've seen this happen in Scotland. And, you know, I we worked very hard indeed to say to people that you don't have to Show your Welsh by voting for a nationalist party. You can reaffirm your Welsh identity by voting for Welsh labor because we are as Welsh as you are and determined that that identity goes on being part of the relationship between you and us. And then my final point, and this goes more to Rory's question, is that I think we try and speak In a voice and with a set of policies that are all authentically labor as well. That will be clear to somebody who's interested But these ideas and the way we talk about them comes out to that labor tradition.\n\nI do think that people respond to, You know, a sense of authenticity about a political party, and sometimes that will mean saying things that you know not everybody will agree with. But they are what you believe in, and you are there to talk about the things that you believe in and to make the case for them and to do that with that sense of authenticity. And I think that has been on our side as well.\n\nSpeaker 0: Did you think that we we knew Labour as it were under Tony Blair went too Bar in that kind of neoliberal pro globalization private sector direction, and that that started to send confusing signals about what labor is and what lay what labor, to use your word, authentically is.\n\nSpeaker 2: I think what is authentically labor in Wales, You know, is different. So what is going to appeal to people elsewhere where there isn't the same tradition and the same sort of class structure and so on? You you may remember, also, Rodri gave a lecture early on in devolution, which I have to admit to having Having had a hand in writing for him, which talked about clear red water.\n\nSpeaker 0: I do remember it.\n\nSpeaker 2: And, that was trying to Set out, you know, a distinctive agenda for labor in Wales, which was not part of marketization, Not part of a sense that, you know, the way you improve public services was by allowing people to become serial shoppers, so choice Agenda and so on. No. That is not because he or I believed that that was the right prescription for elsewhere in the kingdom, but we knew that those things would resonate, with people who look to the Labour Party in words.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, Mark, some of These things are national. I mean, you're opposed to Triton, right, when Keir Starmer's in favourite Triton? That's not particularly Welsh, that's a, that's a global nuclear weapon. I mean, that's, So you're taking positions on things that go well beyond the traditions of a particular part of the United Kingdom?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Of course, we all have long histories of, views, and that was my view and is my view, but it's not part of what I do as the first minister of whales because I have no responsibilities, in that field. And, you know, I do my best to Spend my time working on the things for which the Senev and myself as first minister have responsibility, and I Try while I'm doing this job, you know, not to get drawn into debates about things that other people have to discharge Because the responsibilities belong to them, but it doesn't mean that my own ideas and, you know, my own beliefs have changed.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mark, if if Scotland did, become independent or if we did have a United Ireland and Northern Ireland became part of the republic. I know these are both massive ifs. But if you would sort of rank them in order, I think that the likelihood of Northern Ireland border poll is probably 1st, and I think then an independent Scotland probably 2nd. But How does Wales how does Wales shape a future then as as sort of this bit on the end of England? And I don't mean that disrespectfully, but, I mean, that That could happen.\n\nI just wonder how you think about that.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, those are really important questions, and we're having to address them directly in a way that we never needed to do previously, and that's because I think, you know, the risk of the United Kingdom will not continue is greater today than at any time in my political lifetime. I certainly don't think it's inevitable. I think there is an offer about the United Kingdom. It's a labor offer, in my view that people would wish to buy into. You know, they would see the advantages that the United Kingdom can bring, and we are desperately short of an articulation by any other party of the positive case for a voluntary union.\n\nWe have had to set up a a commission. It's chaired by Rowan Williams and by someone called Laura McAllister, who's a distinguished professor here in Wales. It's asked to look at 2 questions. First of all, If the United Kingdom stays together, how can we better organize ourselves to make sure that it goes on being a success? But But then it has a second question, which is that if the United Kingdom starts not to stay together, what are the options for Wales?\n\nBecause the idea that's, you know, everything else Continue Scotland leaves, and everything else continues as though that haven't happened. It's clearly not plausible at all, but we've never needed to do serious thinking about what the choices for Wales would be, and the commission will help us to do that. But we're having to map out that territory with a seriousness But, I think just reflects the risks that we we currently face.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. How would you define the independence debate right now?\n\nSpeaker 2: In Wales, it's still very much a minority view. You know, we in our election in May of last year, it had the virtue of We are clarity about it. You know, I would stand on, platforms that the the debates at the BBC will be broadcasting. I would have somebody on my right who believed in abolishing the evolution altogether. And the BBC gave me core prominence despite the fact they've never Won a single seat in any election, but there they were as though they were already poor player.\n\nAnd on my left, it would be Adam Price, the leader by Connery, Absolutely, explicitly for the election on the basis that the vote for him was a vote for independence. And, you know, I was the advocate of, as I say, strong and entrenched devolution in a successful United Kingdom, and there's no doubt at all with the center of gravity In Welsh opinion lines, there is a growing interest in independence because of the risks that are there to the future of the United Kingdom. That's Inevitable, but it would still be a of a small minority, but no more than 20% or so.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can I just ask you briefly about COVID? Your your profile and the profile of of devolution rose during COVID, And there were certain things that you did very differently. But, ultimately, the UK government does control the purse purse strings. And I just wonder how you feel about the way that the post Brexit you were Brexit minister in the Welsh government, how the post Brexit, strategy, insofar as there is one, that the UK government impinges upon you and whether you fear that, ultimately, You end up having to impose austerity whether you like it or not, because of that relationship and and how you get around that politically given that we are going into what looks like being an incredibly challenging time economically.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, we continue to struggle with Brexit Every day, its adverse impacts, on whales are palpable, and it doesn't have to be like this. So, You know, I would have preferred that we stayed inside the European Union altogether. But once a decision was made, I've always believed it was possible to devise a set of circumstances in which we would have left the political side of the union, but we would have continued to have had access to the single market, part of the customs union, defended our economic interests In that way, and, you know, we we desperately need a government who believes in working alongside our European partners rather than A constant, pattern of provocation. But on the issue of austerity, you know, we've had a decade of austerity. We've had a decade of austerity.\n\nI was very proud to knock doors in Wales during the 2017 election, for example, because they've got manifesto contained so many things that we were already doing in Wales. We promised free prescriptions. We've had them since 2003, we said that we would reinstate education maintenance allowances. We've never abolished them in Wales. We said that we would store nurse bursaries.\n\nWe've kept them in Wales. You know, I could list a whole string of things for you that we managed to do Within the budget that the Tory government gives to us, we do that by making the choices that we would make as a Labour government. We prioritize the things that we think, you know, leave money in people's pockets so that they can manage the other parts of their lives, and we do it, you know, in the conditions of austerity. So that will become more difficult. Okay.\n\nYeah. But, you know, in the end, You have political choices to make.\n\nSpeaker 0: You said there you talked about the the the damage that Brexit is doing, the the consequences being palpable. Do you not share my frustration that the Labour Party nationally still seems to sort of have this great elephant in the room. They don't really want to talk about those consequences. And if Labour's strategy is to be a strategy of growth, as Keir Starmer keeps saying, Surely, there has to be a much more open debate about how we deal with those consequences.\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, Brexit is a is a frightening, topic for politicians because of its divisive nature, and you don't want to reopen old wounds and just spend your whole time trying to, you know, repair again, that damage, I am absolutely sure that, you know, the next Labour government will take a very different view, not on Brexit itself. That's done, sadly. We're you know, We could just face up to that, but we'll take a very different view to how we conduct our relations with our nearest and most important partners. Yeah. Most importantly, economically, we will want to have a cooperative set of relationships, with, again, based on Mutual respect, but we'll recognize that the interest of Welsh farmers are not served by Trade deals far flung on the other side of the world, but are in allowing Welsh farmers to be able to export They're fantastic produce to people in the Southern Mediterranean who were our biggest customers and who now Can't buy from Wales because by the time the food gets there, it's no longer fresh or fit to sell.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. We we we we're coming to the end of the time, and thanks For giving us so much of your time. I'm sorry for the technical hitches at the start. But before I maybe give Roy the final question, I just want to give my final question. You have said that you'd step down during this term, I e, before 2026.\n\nIs that a definitive done deal?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I haven't changed my mind. I think one of the one of the things that, you know, has helped, really, is that I try and answer if I ask them as best I can. And it was always my plan, really, that by the time I was halfway through this So, Tom, I'll be nearly 70 years old by then. It's not just me, but it it would be true. There will be, it would be right, You know, to hand on to somebody who has the next 20 years in their sights.\n\nWe've done that very successfully in Wales. You know, Cadwin handed on to, Rodri handed on to Cadwin during a term. Cadwin handed on to me during a term. I plan to do The same somewhere in the second half of this term.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mark, thank you so much for for coming on. Last little one for me. Do you feel that being in politics damages people? I I felt it was terrible for my mind, my body, my soul. I think I cease To be a proper human being, I ended up talking to people as though they were voters all the time.\n\nDo you think it's had any impact on your character?\n\nSpeaker 2: Well, I'm a politician by accident Rather than by design, I never set out to do what I do now. Does it change, how you are? Well, inevitably, it does, doesn't it? Because it's not possible for me in Wales, at least, to go anywhere Incognito. If you're out, there will be people who can up to you.\n\nThey want to talk to you. They want to share their views. On the whole, as you know, most people are astonishingly I liked, you know, just genuinely interested in wanting to have those, encounters with you, and You have to regard that as part of the privilege of the job. My wife went to 10 b, you know, Big Wash tourist place, recently without me and came back and said how glad she was to that I wasn't there. And she didn't mean that in a vastly made to me.\n\nShe just meant that she was able to go and just do what she wanted to do without just being stopped Every few yards by people wanting wanting to talk, it does change you. It doesn't have to change you for the worse. You know, you just have to Regard it, as I say, as part of the privilege of the job that you do.\n\nSpeaker 0: And final final final question, Mark. Have you kept up your Latin? I'm fascinated by people who study Latin to the extent that you did.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Well, I I tried to a little bit, and I only ever managed to do it in the summer. One of the things that I promised myself in the summer when I have a chance is, I will spend if I'm walking, which I'm trying to do a fair bit about, And I will learn some poetry as I go along. It's about keeping you mind busy. And I I will occasionally go back and find some piece of catalactos or something and, Remind myself about it and try and commit it as best I can to, to my memory.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, thank you for your talk, Gagees. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope you have.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we'll maybe do it again another day. All the best.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thanks a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Bye bye. So, Alastair, what did you think of that?\n\nSpeaker 0: I really enjoyed that. I thought he was frank. Obviously, he is he is a politician. He's the 1st minister, and he's not going to dive into really difficult areas where he doesn't necessarily want to make news. But I I I thought he was very thoughtful, reflective, and, yeah, I enjoyed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Alison, one of the things that I thought was fascinating was just this little glimpse into, I mean, obviously, I I was obsessed with it. So this kind of glimpse into Labour politics, the seventies eighties, these kind of big big characters, because there were a lot of them in in Cumbria too. Going a long way back, there was a guy called lord Adams of Ennadale, Jack Adams, who was the kind of great hero of Cumbria in the 19 thirties, 19 forties, brought a lot of the money in, got a lot of the projects going, but quite kind of some of their reputation, quite kind of authoritarian, quite autocratic in the way they ran Oh, there are.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Absolutely. And that I I thought I mean, that style of politics has been very common, throughout the UK, various periods of history. I used to love listening to Neil Kinnock talk about some of the big characters in Welsh politics. And, now I thought I thought he was very he he does have a it's interesting you said to him about, you know, he was very polite.\n\nHe does come across as being very mild mannered.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, it's it's a brilliant technique, isn't it? It's a brilliant political technique because what he can do is he can sort of be Very gently truthful and hinted his views without really creating a story. So clearly, he's massively left wing, but he's got He had a very elegant line to that, didn't he? Well, you know, was my views from the past?\n\nThen he concedes it is my view now, but Lady doesn't have any more responsibility, is it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Responsibility. Yeah. Yeah. But I thought I thought in as you know, I thought he handled the, you know because it's true. When we were At number 10, and I can remember, Roderick Morgan was a great character.\n\nHe really was. He used to he used to turn up for his meetings with Tony Blair. I remember one of them. He turned up Literally carrying his papers at a Tesco shopping bag. And so it's just he was a very I really liked Rodriep, but he But and Mark was I remember Mark was responsible for that.\n\nHe drove that strategy of what you call clear red water, of of being different. And that could be a bit irritating for us because, you know, you you you're at the you're sitting there at the center. You think you're all powerful. Tony Blair's the leader of the Labour Party, the prime minister, and You've got these guys, Danny Wells, sort of it feels a little bit like, you know, potshots. But, actually, when you hear him explain it as he did there, You can see the the rationale.\n\nYou can see the strategy behind it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Worked out for them, didn't it? Didn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: And I I just love the fact that we have part of our United Kingdom, which is being so trashed by These people, the conservatives. And we've got this part of the United Kingdom, which has had a labor in power for a century. It's a wonderful, wonderful story.\n\nSpeaker 1: I also wonder whether the lesson that maybe he's trying to draw, but he's too polite to say, is that if Scottish Labour had been prepared to be more courageously left wing And maybe Northern Labour being prepared to be more courageously left wing. They wouldn't be in the situation they're in now. But to hold those bases, they needed to stick hard on the left.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Possibly saying that. I think he was also saying that the you see, I think the the other thing, in Scotland, so many of our big national figures have come from Scotland. And look, plenty of national big national figures have come from Wales as well, but I think he was he was maybe saying There was too much of focus in in the UK Labour Party, the Scottish politicians on the UK, whereas he was saying there were a lot of Welsh politicians who really, really focused on Wales. Yeah.\n\nBut I thought he I can see why I can see why he remains popular even on the basis of my chat.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm with you. The other thing I would have had a go at him on if I'd if I'd thought I'd make any Progress on it. But as you say, he's too polite and smooth to do it. Is this question of all these devolved governments? It's true of Sadiq Khan as mayor of London too, which is that they are in these very odd positions because they don't have much control over a lot of things.\n\nAnd that allows them to blame the conservative government for a lot of stuff without having full responsibility for it. It's quite a kinda clever thing to be in. So they can take the credit for anything that goes well. And anything goes badly, they can say that's not our fault. It's the fault of the other lot.\n\nSpeaker 0: Politics, Rory. It's called politics.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well but can you ever solve that with devolution? Because it it makes accountability quite difficult. I remember, you know, with Tsidikhan trying to say signalling's not being done up on the Piccadilly line since the you know, I was doing so in independence, since 19 seventies And knife crime's rising, and you're meant to be responsible for transport and housing and crime. But the answer was always Tory cuts.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And and it is. And, also, there's no doubt at all that the the Johnson government has had a strategy for trying to undermine Sadiq Khan that has included targeting the funding of some of the things that he that he is responsible for. I just think that's the that's why these relationships do matter. And I do think that I mean, again, he was he was even Mark was even very polite about his relations with with Boris Johnson.\n\nHe clearly can't stand the guy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You know, that was that was pretty peculiar, wasn't it? Very polite about Boris Johnson. Very\n\nSpeaker 0: polite. He he made it absolutely clear Johnson showed no respect whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 1: One wonders, yeah, one wonders around the dinner table what Actually, he thinks about Boris Johnson or even of Tony Blair.\n\nSpeaker 0: Indeed. Indeed. Well, we know what he talked about thought about Boris Johnson because he was caught on camera in one of those fly on the wall documentaries saying how awful he was. Anyway, I enjoyed that. I'm glad to be",
