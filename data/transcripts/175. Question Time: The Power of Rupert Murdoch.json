Welcome to the rest is politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And first question, I think, to get us off on is Rupert Murdoch Mhmm. Who claims to have stepped aside. Now, of course, Murdoch's something we think about a lot. You interviewed Brian Cox, a great star of Succession, which I think is a pretty fascinating insight. I mean, even if it's slightly off beam, Did you feel Succession was a relatively realistic portrayal of the way that Murdoch, his family, that empire operated? Well, Brian Cox, the actor, Doesn't want anybody to think that it's based on Murdoch. Right. And I get that because they want to think they're creating something completely new. But if you know and you've seen the Murdochs operating, There's a lot in there. There's a lot in there. And, actually, what's really interesting now just to throw in 1 question here from Dave h, what would it take to dislodge the disproportionate influence of the Murdoch press on political reporting. We can come on to that. I had lots of sort of interactions with Murdoch and the Murdoch family. And I And and famously sorry. To be To be cheeky famously, one of the big moments was the decision of Tony Blair and you, I think, to fly out to meet Rupert Murdoch before the 97 election. And that was important because the right wing media, particularly the Murdoch controlled media, had been very important in the defeat of Neil Kinnock The time around. So getting the Murdoch media at least friendly and on side was considered to be quite a coup before the 97 election. Yeah. I mean, I've always thought that Murdoch Bakkt us in 1997 because he knew that we were going to win. I don't think we won because Murdoch backed us. And I think you can overdo. I'm not I wouldn't understate the influence of media in this, but I think you can overdo it. I think we were gonna win. They worked that out. And it was a political risk because lots of people in the Labour Party were very, very angry. And tell us a bit bit about where is it that you went to meet them? Hayman Island. Wow. Yeah. So so that was, like, on a on a Boat or on an island or We we flew we flew to Sydney. Paul Keating, one of my favorite Politicians put us up at Kirribilli House, which is the prime minister's residence in Sydney. He was he had some great insights into into Murdoch. I remember he was he said was he said, the thing you gotta remember about Rupert, his priorities are as follows. Number 1, Rupert. Number 2, Rupert's business interests. Number 3, Rupert's political power. Number 4, the family. Number 5, everything else. That was kind of his view. And 25 years ago, did Murdoch already seem like quite an old man when you met him? No. He didn't seem old. He seemed pretty grizzled. It was very interesting to watch him at that event. So this was a thing where all the new the News Corp editors were gathered together in the same place. And you were being you were being given a chance To talk to all the editors. And Tony did a a sort of speech. Yeah. And, but what was so I think I may have told you this story before. So we're having this we so we flew to Sydney. Keating put on a an Australian Air Force jet. We flew up with him. He came with us. We arrived at this. Can I just sort of stop on that? I mean, what I mean, the the listeners aren't getting many questions here, but they're But it's a fascinating story, and this is really big news, Murdoch stepping inside. I mean, this man is, Has dominated not just the European and Australian, but the American media landscape through Fox News. I mean, he's you know, a lot of recent Trump came in. But I'm also sort of wondering, I mean, In Britain, it would look a bit odd for a prime minister using a national air force jet to fly out to a meeting with a a newspaper editor. I mean, that really gives you a sense of the power of this matter. No. I think from Keating's perspective, he was the prime minister of Australia building relations with Tony Blair, who was widely expected to be prime minister of the UK. And he he was, though. He took he gave us a lift, and he stayed for the whole trip that we were there. We spent lots of time with him. So so it does illustrate the power of Murdoch that he's able he was able to get Yeah. And also the fact that we decided despite the political risk and despite lots of people I mean, there's a piece there's one of the most tragic passages in my in my diaries. I mean, you know, I love Neil Kinnett to bits, but he did Threatened me with a with a a boiling kettle. And when he came to sort of said, Neil, what's wrong? What's wrong? He just fucking Murdoch. Going to see Murdoch. You know, it was a very, very unpopular thing for a lot of people. I I had a tiny example of something in a much more mini scale, which was before I became a politician, so we're back in kinda 2008. And when I was, teaching at Harvard and doing stuff about Afghanistan, I was invited to a dinner and I sat next to Rupert Murdoch. I mean, when he wants to be, he can be unbelievably charming. The first thing that struck me is very unusually for a very powerful wealthy man. He listened. I mean, Generally powerful, wealthy men are just on transmit all the time. And he speaks very quietly, doesn't he? He speaks very quietly. He mumbles. Listen very thoughtfully. He gave me some very good advice. I was trying to hire somebody for a a charity. He said, Roy, my advice to you is all that matters is that they should be loyal and hardworking. Nothing else matters at all, which actually really clarified things for me. But most striking of all, the end of the evening, he said, you've been very interested in Afghanistan, and I'd like to come pick you up tomorrow morning in my car, Take you down to the Wall Street Journal. I'd like you to speak to all my editors. So sure enough, next morning, car turns up with Murdoch in it. I get in the car. We drive down to the Wall Street Journal. All the editors are assembled. He sticks me in the seat. And it was, I thought, interesting because I I don't know what the political game was. I wasn't a member of parliament. I was just somebody critical of the Afghan war. I think there was a sense that along with all the other things, he has an instinct for news, And he sensed that my criticism in the Afghan war was something his editors needed to hear Mhmm. And he was gonna take time out of his diary to move me in the car and bring me. I don't know. I mean, that's the only encounter I've ever had with him. Then when I became a politician, I really kept distance from him. I didn't wanna go to his parties. I didn't want to get Too close. I had a huge row with James Murdoch, his son, about Afghanistan. Because it then turned out that his son was very, very pro Afghan war, and the father was obviously more skeptical. So I ended up with Rebecca Brooks and James Murdoch in this big argument, and that was really the last time I really encountered them. So he's he's announced that Lachlan, 1 of the one of his 2 sons. He's got 2 sons, 2 daughters who are gonna fight over the spoils as it were. That's the succession bit, which I think is still to play out because there's 1 Elizabeth's very well known. She was married to Matthew Freud for a while. She's now married to a very famous artist. And they've all done lots of different things, But Lachlan looks like he Rupert is trying to put him in the main poll position. But I can remember once when they came to number 10, and it's true. I mean, you know, when Rupert Murdoch came into town, he would pop in to see Tony. He would usually come through the back door. I think partly his request, partly ours. And I remember once we were having a drink up in Tony's flat above number 11, and we started to we're talking about the Middle East. And James, who was, as you say, quite strong views on foreign policy, I would say coming at things from a very anti Israel position. Murdoch very much pro Israel. Tony sort of sitting there watching this and watching. And eventually, James slightly started to lose his temper about the situation, the fucking Israelis and the you know? And and I remember Rupert Murdoch at one point saying, James, you don't talk like that in the prime minister's house. Bit of a slap down. I remember saying to Tony afterwards, that was really interesting, but it was quite I thought it was interesting that he'd let them go a bit. Anybody who knows Murdoch, it was interesting what people like Andrew Nielle Loeys was saying was that, you know, the idea that he's gonna step back, forget it. But he is 92. I'll tell you the other thing that I remember 92? I mean, that's the Sirus Edge. Yeah. That's a That's that's, 12 years older than Joe Biden. So I think that that the other thing I remember from that Hayman Island though was that, you know, we did see it as quite an opportunity because it wasn't just that you know, you you talk about when you got the editors together. If you think that, for example, I don't think Any of his newspapers around the world, none of them. I don't think any of them, quotes, were against the Iraq war. Now that means that, basically, there is a corporate line here. So that's why, perhaps, we felt important to sort of keep him on board. Cheney got very irritated with him towards the end because he thought that that That editorial support gave him kind of the ability to sort of foam when he wanted, say what he wanted, and and it doesn't. The truth is it doesn't. But But I remember in that Hayman Island thing, it was a very, very interesting insight when we hadn't even finished the speech by the time we got there. We're still working on it. And I sat down at this there was this barbecue down by the pool at this fancy hotel in Heimannand. They've taken over the whole resort. And Murdoch came and sat down next to me, and Tony was chatting away to some of the other people who were there. And I said to Murdoch, we'd put more work into this speech than any other speech for the apart from the party conference. I mean, pretty much moderate bullshit, I would call it. We had put a lot of work into it, but it was like it was just small talk. Next thing I know, editor of The Times and the editor of The Sun come and join us, and Rupert says, or mumbles, he says, Very important speech, tiny players making tomorrow. Oh, here. They sort of sit up, and then they disappear, and then they come back 20 minutes later and tell us that it's gonna be front page lead. They're gonna run extract. Gosh. So that little sentence No. That was it. That was it. That was it. So it's an Extraordinary example of the power, isn't it, I think? Yeah. Well, we should we should get into this because this is a huge issue in our democracies, the power of these companies. I think it is waning. I do think it's waning. I think that But you're sometimes a bit paradoxical about it, aren't you? Because sometimes you're like, it's waning Yeah. And social media's on the rise. Yeah. And actually, it wasn't that important, the Labour victory. But other times when you're irritated, you're like Fucking right wing media are dominating everything. I said no. I think that I think where I get irritated is that they can still dominate the agenda. We had do you know this the issue we got most questions about this week? By a mile was why was there no coverage on the television of the the rejoin European Union March? Well, let's let's take let's take a question then. Lina Pulley, Why was there almost no coverage to the rejoin EU march on Saturday? I saw nothing on BBC or Channel FM news, very different on the Sunday papers. However, I've watched very good coverage by a French TV session, which asked, why are there no British cameras here? So tell us about much. Fiona went on the march? She did. I was at the football. And I look. I think Even when we're doing the People's Vote campaign and we're getting marches of 1,000,000 people, it was a struggle sometimes to get them there. But I think with this one, I think that is where I would say the right way in media influence is. If the papers aren't covering it, the broadcasters decide it's not important. Right. I think that's the problem. And why is The Guardian The Independent not covering it? They might have covered it a bit. I don't know. Look, let's be honest. The issue is not what it was because if you've got neither Labour nor the Lib Dems nor you know, I think the other thing, to be honest, the the the people who were speaking at it were the same sort of people who were speaking before. I think there was a very interesting piece that somebody sent me actually from The Spectator, where they said that, you know, if there had been people there who said, I voted Brexit, and I wish I hadn't, if there'd been people there who said, this is what I'd used to think, and now this is what I think, but it was sort of the same voices. But I but it it was a fascinating thing. I was on the way up to the football, and Fiona was texting me updates. And so she's there at this sort of, you know, you're a pro European, rejoin the year, but Gieffer Hovstad is a very good speaker, etcetera. Next thing she says, oh my god. There's a ban the ban on the bully dogs. March are are lively at the same time. And then there was something about a protest going on in relation to Pakistan. And she said this the the ban the ban people, the bully dogs people, the work of many of them. Pro bully dogs Pro body dogs. Yeah. But they she said they were walking down the street surrounded by media. Yeah. Because the media decided Gets a more more exciting story. Yeah. More interesting. Now, having a mayor. Lisa, after listening to A Tale of 2 Andys, I wonder were we wrong in Bristol to vote against having a mayor? I I'm very Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm very, very sad. And I actually was really impressed by the mayor of Bristol, and I know that she came to have him on on the show. And I I I think we should have more local government, not less. I mean, I think the anti campaigners are so good about saying, oh, we don't their line is always we don't need more politicians. But what we actually need is better quality local government with more resources closer to people, and it will be a huge improvement in our democracy. We got a lot of feedback on the the 2 Andys, Andy Burnham, mayor of Manchester, Andy Street, mayor of Miss Woodlands, and it was very, very positive. And I think a lot of what they liked about it was the fact that both were actually saying. They weren't party voices, were they? They're they're Andy's Labour Andy Burnham Labour, Andy Street of Troy. But they weren't saying, We're here to sort of parrot the party line. They were absolutely about their place. And it was And I thought I thought Marvin, the the the Bristol mayor. I thought he was terrific, and it was tragic for me. And that's just part of this sort of you know, what you say in your book, we haven't bought enough into the idea of devolution. And so no. I I I completely agree with Lisa. I I think we've gotta have more more mayors, not fewer. Very good. Now here's here's a bit of a tough one for you, Rory. Yes, sir. Okay. Well, it's tough one for both of us, actually. Marianne Fallon, you never discuss what is happening to disabled sick people. There are millions of of others. I've asked this question many times. I've given up now. And when you know how Rory Stewart voted on policies that harm us, there's the reason. So we're back to your voting record. We don't need to go into that. But I think I have got a point. We don't really talk about this very much, and there are millions of of disabled people. I'm gonna give a, a shout out to a school I went to last week down in Exmouth in Devon, the Deaf Academy. Apparently, there are 22 schools for the deaf in in the UK. What was interesting really interesting about this one, the the the well, they're not all children. They're from with children up to 25 and then young adults. And they're deaf, but also have often special educational needs, physical, mental health. It was a very, very, very inspiring place. I I met with the student council. There's all Some profoundly deaf, some with literally no hearing at all, others who've had implants that they can hear a bit, and some with hearing dogs, and it was a wonderful place. Anyway, their current campaigns, they've won the campaign to get a 20 mile an hour speed limit outside. They've won the campaign for a separate crossing. Their next 2 campaigns And the first I think I think we should back them on this. Their 1st campaign is they want to have BSL sign language on all government press conferences. Right. Now they have it in Scotland and Wales Yeah. Yeah. But when number 10 do a press conference They don't have it. They don't have it. And the next Request. And the next request, which is relates to the question in a way, they want to have the symbol for disability changed. Okay. At the moment, the symbol for disability is a wheelchair. Yep. And so what they say that does is it excludes people with Yep. Invisible disability. So I think that's something that if we do do a manifesto, Rory, there's 2 things that we should we should write. And let's and let's do that manifesto. And a quick Sort of shout out to the, Scottish government. So my my sister, Fiona, has Down syndrome. Mhmm. And the Scottish government, whom I'm often kicking, has actually Done really well by her. I mean, I think there's been fantastic support for her in getting her into work. I mean, she had a work coach. They, initially helped fund the company that employs her. And Fiona gets, I think, real fulfillment, out of the time that she spends in work. She Goes to work every day, and I think the company that employs her is very good at supporting her. But I also think I hope they feel they get a lot out of her. So Tribute to the Scottish Government. On also, on, my Fiona, who has been to the Apple shop quite a few times recently, and on 2 occasions, as she's gone in and asked for to see somebody. They've said, do you mind having somebody helping you who's deaf? And she said, no. Not at all. And they did it all through an iPad. And these kids down in in Exmouth, they were when they were talking about what they want to do when they leave, it was just fantastic. 1 wanted to be a football coach, 1 wanted to work with dogs, 1 wanted to work with the museum. Now, Adam van der Buscher, what 5 rules should STARMA put in place to improve governmental transparency, integrity, And in the end, regain trust in our corrupt solicitor. I'm gonna start. So rule number 1, ministers should serve a minimum of 2 years unless there's some Completely unprecedented scandal. Mhmm. Number 2, they should have a 3 week training course before they take over with a proper handover. Number 3, I think, of course, we should change to something more like the New Zealand proportional representation Mhmm. System. I would like to see half the cabinet Being appointed people with real professional skills and knowledge of their areas Oh, wonderful. Rather than just the bureaucracy. And then the final thing is I'd like to see much more They're called devolution down to a local level. Those are my 5. Okay. 30. I agree with most of those. The cabinet thing would be a massive change, and maybe we need that. First of all, I would like Keir to say in the manifesto, our politics is close to being broken. To repair it, we have to have a Fundamental rethink of how we do. Apologies at every level. I would love it if he said during the campaign, I want to put my shadow cabinet on notice If we become the cabinet, I can tell them now that if any of them ever stand at the dispatch box in the House of Commons and say something that is a lie, they will be sacked. And if there's something that is untrue or factually incorrect and they don't correct it immediately, they will also be sacked. I think that would really, really signal to people that he's serious about this. And I think the other thing is, I mean, I do recommend maybe we should put it you mentioned Angela Rayner in the in the main podcast. Maybe we should put this in the, in the newsletter. I I do think that some of the ideas that Anders Reinis is talking about in relation to rebuilding ethics. And the 7 Nolan principles Yep. Honesty, openness, objectivity, selfless, integrity, accountability, and leadership, I think Labour should persuade parliament to endorse those for all MPs. Very good. Okay, Roy. Lots of questions to come. Let's just take a quick break. Helen Laws, what would your advice be on strategy to have the best chance Of getting a PR system of voting in to avoid the toxic polarizations ruining ruining Saudi. So if you were in charge of advising a campaign for Changing our electoral system, partial representation. How would you actually think about achieving it? And what is it realistically? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? How would you set about doing it? We talked a bit a little bit about this on the main podcast in relation to New Zealand. I do think that there's always a danger in a campaign where you feel it so strongly yourself that you can't quite understand why others don't. You have to get new voices. And so I think that the I do think that the Democrats and the Greens, who are the most committed to that sort of change. The the they should come together and actually start really pressing the Labour Party. Because in the end, you can't change it without a government. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So they should be putting far more pressure on them. And I think doing it by saying, look, we'll help you get rid of the Tories if. Very good. Okay. Question from you. Well, I want just this. James Russell re Chris Cabbah. Why won't former Attorney general Suella Braverman beheld to account for her intervention. So this is where a police officer has been charged with murder, presumably after a pretty thorough process by the Crown Prosecution Service. You and I and nobody else knows more than what we've read and what we've seen. And and this this is where a lot of Firearm officers have handed back their weapons and protests in solidarity with these police officers. And Solely Braveman put out a statement on social media essentially saying we can't have a situation where situation where policemen go to work without feeling that you know, thinking they're gonna end up in court kind of thing, which if when I was a journalist, You just thought, oh, is that not contemptible? Interesting, isn't it? So we just talked to Theresa May about this in 2 episodes of Leading, which will be out on Monday. But One of the things that she was saying is that as home secretary, she was under huge pressure as a conservative to always support the police. Actually, she didn't. She's often been very, very Critical of police's home secretary. Sular Brawman obviously made a different choice, which I guess is the kind of Republican American choice, which is ticket, to get it right or wrong. Exactly. I'm always on the side of the police, right or wrong. But I think there is a you know, it was interesting, the solicitor general put out a a media advisory note reminding the media and users of social media, he said, of the law concerning contempt of court. And I I have no idea whether that was in direct response to Wow. Swaddler Brabham member. I thought it was quite a big deal. It's quite a quite a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. Another one for you, Rory. What did Rory discuss with Hamza Yousef? John in Oban wants to know. Oh, so Hamza Yousef and and I met, at the UN minister of Scotland? First minister of Scotland at the UN General Assembly. And, in fact, I met him just after I met the president of Malawi, and We were discussing Scotland's international development program. Scotland has a small international development program, but it's very, very interesting under Nicola Sturgeon and now continued under Hamster Yousef. They've been taking some very interesting leads, particularly on the issue of climate reparations and the issue of Really making sure that the people who are suffering most from climate change, the extreme poor of the world, get the support. That all the climate change money doesn't just go to technological change Converting people to renewable energy, but also thinks about the people in Somalia who are experiencing, you know, 7th year of droughts and are on the receiving end of this. And so, Yeah. I'm very interested in the way in which a smaller country like Scotland, can define the agenda in that way. Rachel, this is for your friend, Jillian Keegan. My daughter's secondary school has been closed for 4 weeks. There seems to be no plan for a return to appropriate face to face learning, And Department of Education embargoes on sharing information, meaning media attention has moved on. Does the government just react to what's in the public eye? Well and we've gone round round of this. I mean, this is the question of the fact that these buildings are unsafe. And so Gillian Keegan made the call just before term started to close schools to the absolute fury, obviously, understandably, of Parents, teachers, pupils who suddenly found just at the beginning of term that their school buildings were closed. I think It was the right thing to do, but I can also see why people are very angry about it. She did also say in parliament that the kids love being in porta cabins. I I was Porta cabin seating. Yeah. And the school that you keep going on about. Yeah. You wear a porta cabin. Yeah. My my all my dreams about that. My English class is from the porta cabin. No. It's been fine. Rather, you should have the last questions today. Okay. Now my last question, I'm afraid it's it's less highbrow than some of the questions you've been trying. Trivial like you said this podcast was. No. No. No. Another of your flutter eyebrow. Well, then can't you ever get your understanding? You you shouldn't listen to those things. You really wanna see them. I only listen to it because Elizabeth Day, the interviewee, sent me the clip saying this is hilarious. So you say just trying to wind you up. She she knows where your buttons are. So what Alastair's referring to and he I I've really offended him. And I actually I also really blame It's Dave for sharing all these clips because there's obviously no way Alison's gonna slog through listening to me on somebody else's podcast. I won't even go on to Shag Mary Avoid. Yeah. But I'm I I've I've been publicizing my book, Politics on the Edge by doing a lot of podcasts. And and in them, basically, all I get asked about is The podcast. But you will be pleased that when I was on with Lorraine Kelly yesterday on ITV I love Lorraine. We did an enormous amount about the podcast. She's a huge fan, and that's Probably much bigger listeners than any of these things you're mocking me about. Mhmm. Now here we are. Richard Dean. Alastair, I'm not gonna answer this to you. Yes. Have you a go to song that reenergizes you if you're feeling low in energy or uncertain? Any quite pacy Motown? Okay. Go on. Give us an example. Anything from the 4 tops. Oh, ain't no mountain high enough. All always does it for me. Okay. Ain't no mountain high enough. Do in the gym? Any of the vast Albert stuff, A lot of Elvis Is there stuff you run to, box 2, or just cheers you up in the morning? Of the above. All of the above. All of the above. And do you play music very loud? Do your neighbors hate being next to you? No. My name is Lubbock, because I play the bagpipes very badly. I also I'll tell you the best running music of all time is the Bee Gees Live at Massachusetts. Go on. Give us a line of that. No. Okay. No. I'm not. No. Oh, that is so disappointing. No. But it's very hard to do the BGs. What about you? Go to music? Go to music. I I I You're just not into music, are you? No. No. I'm not pronouncing music. Ridiculous. I'm not not your dude. Very it's I think it's probably because I'm tone deaf. It doesn't help much. Right. Okay. Is that true? Yeah. Yeah. I I can I can't hold a tune? Yeah. Well, I'm not a great singer. No. No. No. I I and I it's the same with the pipes. I can play from music, but I can't play from here. Oh, right. Okay. Which is a big problem with vaccines. A major major problem. Yeah. Yeah. No. I I I literally I run to a recording of Handel's Messiah. That's a lie. No. It's true. Recorded by Do you? Yep. I do. Recorded by the 16 in Dublin, and I can show you the recording on my I don't mind that. I think that's I think that's okay. I think no. I think that's great. I don't mind that at all. I wouldn't do that, but then again, I was educated in the Porsche cabin. Very good. Well, thank you very much.",

To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show Just go to the rest is politics.com. That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to the rest is politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me,\n\nSpeaker 0: Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And first question, I think, to get us off on is Rupert Murdoch Mhmm. Who claims to have stepped aside. Now, of course, Murdoch's something we think about a lot. You interviewed Brian Cox, a great star of Succession, which I think is a pretty fascinating insight. I mean, even if it's slightly off beam, Did you feel Succession was a relatively realistic portrayal of the way that Murdoch, his family, that empire operated?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Brian Cox, the actor, Doesn't want anybody to think that it's based on Murdoch.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I get that because they want to think they're creating something completely new. But if you know and you've seen the Murdochs operating, There's a lot in there. There's a lot in there. And, actually, what's really interesting now just to throw in 1 question here from Dave h, what would it take to dislodge the disproportionate influence of the Murdoch press on political reporting. We can come on to that.\n\nI had lots of sort of interactions with Murdoch and the Murdoch family. And I\n\nSpeaker 1: And and famously sorry. To be To be cheeky famously, one of the big moments was the decision of Tony Blair and you, I think, to fly out to meet Rupert Murdoch before the 97 election. And that was important because the right wing media, particularly the Murdoch controlled media, had been very important in the defeat of Neil Kinnock The time around. So getting the Murdoch media at least friendly and on side was considered to be quite a coup before the 97 election.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I mean, I've always thought that Murdoch Bakkt us in 1997 because he knew that we were going to win. I don't think we won because Murdoch backed us. And I think you can overdo. I'm not I wouldn't understate the influence of media in this, but I think you can overdo it.\n\nI think we were gonna win. They worked that out. And it was a political risk because lots of people in the Labour Party were very, very angry.\n\nSpeaker 1: And tell us a bit bit about where is it that you went to meet them? Hayman Island. Wow. Yeah. So so that was, like, on a on a Boat or on an island or\n\nSpeaker 0: We we flew we flew to Sydney. Paul Keating, one of my favorite Politicians put us up at Kirribilli House, which is the prime minister's residence in Sydney. He was he had some great insights into into Murdoch. I remember he was he said was he said, the thing you gotta remember about Rupert, his priorities are as follows. Number 1, Rupert.\n\nNumber 2, Rupert's business interests. Number 3, Rupert's political power. Number 4, the family. Number 5, everything else. That was kind of his view.\n\nSpeaker 1: And 25 years ago, did Murdoch already seem like quite an old man when you met him?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. He didn't seem old. He seemed pretty grizzled. It was very interesting to watch him at that event. So this was a thing where all the new the News Corp editors were gathered together in the same place.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you were being you were being given a chance To talk to all the editors.\n\nSpeaker 0: And Tony did a a sort of speech. Yeah. And, but what was so I think I may have told you this story before. So we're having this we so we flew to Sydney. Keating put on a an Australian Air Force jet.\n\nWe flew up with him. He came with us. We arrived at this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I just sort of stop on that? I mean, what\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, the the listeners aren't getting many questions here, but they're\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's a fascinating story, and this is really big news, Murdoch stepping inside. I mean, this man is, Has dominated not just the European and Australian, but the American media landscape through Fox News. I mean, he's you know, a lot of recent Trump came in. But I'm also sort of wondering, I mean, In Britain, it would look a bit odd for a prime minister using a national air force jet to fly out to a meeting with a a newspaper editor. I mean, that really gives you a sense of\n\nSpeaker 0: the power of this matter. No. I think from Keating's perspective, he was the prime minister of Australia building relations with Tony Blair, who was widely expected to be prime minister of the UK. And he he was, though. He took he gave us a lift, and he stayed for the whole trip that we were there.\n\nWe spent lots of time with him.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so it does illustrate the power of Murdoch that he's able he was able to get Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And also the fact that we decided despite the political risk and despite lots of people I mean, there's a piece there's one of the most tragic passages in my in my diaries. I mean, you know, I love Neil Kinnett to bits, but he did Threatened me with a with a a boiling kettle. And when he came to sort of said, Neil, what's wrong? What's wrong? He just fucking Murdoch.\n\nGoing to see Murdoch. You know, it was a very, very unpopular thing for a lot of people.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I had a tiny example of something in a much more mini scale, which was before I became a politician, so we're back in kinda 2008. And when I was, teaching at Harvard and doing stuff about Afghanistan, I was invited to a dinner and I sat next to Rupert Murdoch. I mean, when he wants to be, he can be unbelievably charming. The first thing that struck me is very unusually for a very powerful wealthy man. He listened.\n\nI mean, Generally powerful, wealthy men are just on transmit all the time.\n\nSpeaker 0: And he speaks very quietly, doesn't he?\n\nSpeaker 1: He speaks very quietly. He mumbles. Listen very thoughtfully. He gave me some very good advice. I was trying to hire somebody for a a charity.\n\nHe said, Roy, my advice to you is all that matters is that they should be loyal and hardworking. Nothing else matters at all, which actually really clarified things for me. But most striking of all, the end of the evening, he said, you've been very interested in Afghanistan, and I'd like to come pick you up tomorrow morning in my car, Take you down to the Wall Street Journal. I'd like you to speak to all my editors. So sure enough, next morning, car turns up with Murdoch in it.\n\nI get in the car. We drive down to the Wall Street Journal. All the editors are assembled. He sticks me in the seat. And it was, I thought, interesting because I I don't know what the political game was.\n\nI wasn't a member of parliament. I was just somebody critical of the Afghan war. I think there was a sense that along with all the other things, he has an instinct for news, And he sensed that my criticism in the Afghan war was something his editors needed to hear Mhmm. And he was gonna take time out of his diary to move me in the car and bring me. I don't know.\n\nI mean, that's the only encounter I've ever had with him. Then when I became a politician, I really kept distance from him. I didn't wanna go to his parties. I didn't want to get Too close. I had a huge row with James Murdoch, his son, about Afghanistan.\n\nBecause it then turned out that his son was very, very pro Afghan war, and the father was obviously more skeptical. So I ended up with Rebecca Brooks and James Murdoch in this big argument, and that was really the last time I really encountered them.\n\nSpeaker 0: So he's he's announced that Lachlan, 1 of the one of his 2 sons. He's got 2 sons, 2 daughters who are gonna fight over the spoils as it were. That's the succession bit, which I think is still to play out because there's 1 Elizabeth's very well known. She was married to Matthew Freud for a while. She's now married to a very famous artist.\n\nAnd they've all done lots of different things, But Lachlan looks like he Rupert is trying to put him in the main poll position. But I can remember once when they came to number 10, and it's true. I mean, you know, when Rupert Murdoch came into town, he would pop in to see Tony. He would usually come through the back door. I think partly his request, partly ours.\n\nAnd I remember once we were having a drink up in Tony's flat above number 11, and we started to we're talking about the Middle East. And James, who was, as you say, quite strong views on foreign policy, I would say coming at things from a very anti Israel position. Murdoch very much pro Israel. Tony sort of sitting there watching this and watching. And eventually, James slightly started to lose his temper about the situation, the fucking Israelis and the you know?\n\nAnd and I remember Rupert Murdoch at one point saying, James, you don't talk like that in the prime minister's house. Bit of a slap down. I remember saying to Tony afterwards, that was really interesting, but it was quite I thought it was interesting that he'd let them go a bit. Anybody who knows Murdoch, it was interesting what people like Andrew Nielle Loeys was saying was that, you know, the idea that he's gonna step back, forget it. But he is 92.\n\nI'll tell you the other thing that I remember 92?\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, that's the Sirus Edge. Yeah. That's a\n\nSpeaker 0: That's that's, 12 years older than Joe Biden. So I think that that the other thing I remember from that Hayman Island though was that, you know, we did see it as quite an opportunity because it wasn't just that you know, you you talk about when you got the editors together. If you think that, for example, I don't think Any of his newspapers around the world, none of them. I don't think any of them, quotes, were against the Iraq war. Now that means that, basically, there is a corporate line here.\n\nSo that's why, perhaps, we felt important to sort of keep him on board. Cheney got very irritated with him towards the end because he thought that that That editorial support gave him kind of the ability to sort of foam when he wanted, say what he wanted, and and it doesn't. The truth is it doesn't. But But I remember in that Hayman Island thing, it was a very, very interesting insight when we hadn't even finished the speech by the time we got there. We're still working on it.\n\nAnd I sat down at this there was this barbecue down by the pool at this fancy hotel in Heimannand. They've taken over the whole resort. And Murdoch came and sat down next to me, and Tony was chatting away to some of the other people who were there. And I said to Murdoch, we'd put more work into this speech than any other speech for the apart from the party conference. I mean, pretty much moderate bullshit, I would call it.\n\nWe had put a lot of work into it, but it was like it was just small talk. Next thing I know, editor of The Times and the editor of The Sun come and join us, and Rupert says, or mumbles, he says, Very important speech, tiny players making tomorrow. Oh, here. They sort of sit up, and then they disappear, and then they come back 20 minutes later and tell us that it's gonna be front page lead. They're gonna run extract.\n\nGosh.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that little sentence No.\n\nSpeaker 0: That was it. That was it. That was it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's an Extraordinary example of the power, isn't it, I think? Yeah. Well, we should we should get into this because this is a huge issue in our democracies, the power of these companies.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think it is waning. I do think it's waning. I think that\n\nSpeaker 1: But you're sometimes a bit paradoxical about it, aren't you? Because sometimes you're like, it's waning Yeah. And social media's on the rise. Yeah. And actually, it wasn't that important, the Labour victory.\n\nBut other times when you're irritated, you're like Fucking right wing media are dominating everything.\n\nSpeaker 0: I said no. I think that I think where I get irritated is that they can still dominate the agenda. We had do you know this the issue we got most questions about this week? By a mile was why was there no coverage on the television of the the rejoin European Union March?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let's let's take let's take a question then. Lina Pulley, Why was there almost no coverage to the rejoin EU march on Saturday? I saw nothing on BBC or Channel FM news, very different on the Sunday papers. However, I've watched very good coverage by a French TV session, which asked, why are there no British cameras here? So tell us about much.\n\nFiona went on the march?\n\nSpeaker 0: She did. I was at the football. And I look. I think Even when we're doing the People's Vote campaign and we're getting marches of 1,000,000 people, it was a struggle sometimes to get them there. But I think with this one, I think that is where I would say the right way in media influence is.\n\nIf the papers aren't covering it, the broadcasters decide it's not important. Right. I think that's the problem.\n\nSpeaker 1: And why is The Guardian The Independent not covering it?\n\nSpeaker 0: They might have covered it a bit. I don't know. Look, let's be honest. The issue is not what it was because if you've got neither Labour nor the Lib Dems nor you know, I think the other thing, to be honest, the the the people who were speaking at it were the same sort of people who were speaking before. I think there was a very interesting piece that somebody sent me actually from The Spectator, where they said that, you know, if there had been people there who said, I voted Brexit, and I wish I hadn't, if there'd been people there who said, this is what I'd used to think, and now this is what I think, but it was sort of the same voices.\n\nBut I but it it was a fascinating thing. I was on the way up to the football, and Fiona was texting me updates. And so she's there at this sort of, you know, you're a pro European, rejoin the year, but Gieffer Hovstad is a very good speaker, etcetera. Next thing she says, oh my god. There's a ban the ban on the bully dogs.\n\nMarch are are lively at the same time. And then there was something about a protest going on in relation to Pakistan. And she said this the the ban the ban people, the bully dogs people, the work of many of them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pro bully dogs Pro\n\nSpeaker 0: body dogs.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. But\n\nSpeaker 0: they she said they were walking down the street surrounded by media.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Because the media decided Gets a more more exciting story.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. More interesting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, having a mayor. Lisa, after listening to A Tale of 2 Andys, I wonder were we wrong in Bristol to vote against having a mayor? I I'm very Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm very, very sad.\n\nAnd I actually\n\nSpeaker 0: was really\n\nSpeaker 1: impressed by the mayor of Bristol, and I know that she came to have him on on the show. And I I I think we should have more local government, not less. I mean, I think the anti campaigners are so good about saying, oh, we don't their line is always we don't need more politicians. But what we actually need is better quality local government with more resources closer to people, and it will be a huge improvement in our democracy.\n\nSpeaker 0: We got a lot of feedback on the the 2 Andys, Andy Burnham, mayor of Manchester, Andy Street, mayor of Miss Woodlands, and it was very, very positive. And I think a lot of what they liked about it was the fact that both were actually saying. They weren't party voices, were they? They're they're Andy's Labour Andy Burnham Labour, Andy Street of Troy. But they weren't saying, We're here to sort of parrot the party line.\n\nThey were absolutely about their place.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it was\n\nSpeaker 0: And I thought I thought Marvin, the the the Bristol mayor. I thought he was terrific, and it was tragic for me. And that's just part of this sort of you know, what you say in your book, we haven't bought enough into the idea of devolution. And so no. I I I completely agree with Lisa.\n\nI I think we've gotta have more more mayors, not fewer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now here's here's a bit of a tough one for you, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, sir.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Well, it's tough one for both of us, actually. Marianne Fallon, you never discuss what is happening to disabled sick people. There are millions of of others. I've asked this question many times.\n\nI've given up now. And when you know how Rory Stewart voted on policies that harm us, there's the reason. So we're back to your voting record. We don't need to go into that. But I think I have got a point.\n\nWe don't really talk about this very much, and there are millions of of disabled people. I'm gonna give a, a shout out to a school I went to last week down in Exmouth in Devon, the Deaf Academy. Apparently, there are 22 schools for the deaf in in the UK. What was interesting really interesting about this one, the the the well, they're not all children. They're from with children up to 25 and then young adults.\n\nAnd they're deaf, but also have often special educational needs, physical, mental health. It was a very, very, very inspiring place. I I met with the student council. There's all Some profoundly deaf, some with literally no hearing at all, others who've had implants that they can hear a bit, and some with hearing dogs, and it was a wonderful place. Anyway, their current campaigns, they've won the campaign to get a 20 mile an hour speed limit outside.\n\nThey've won the campaign for a separate crossing. Their next 2 campaigns And the first I think I think we should back them on this. Their 1st campaign is they want to have BSL sign language on all government press conferences.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Now\n\nSpeaker 0: they have it in Scotland and Wales\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: But when number 10 do a press conference\n\nSpeaker 1: They don't have it.\n\nSpeaker 0: They don't have it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the next Request. And the\n\nSpeaker 0: next request, which is relates to the question in a way, they want to have the symbol for disability changed.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: At the moment, the symbol for disability is a wheelchair.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: And so what they say that does is it excludes people with Yep. Invisible disability. So I think that's something that if we do do a manifesto, Rory, there's 2 things that we should we\n\nSpeaker 1: should write. And let's and let's do that manifesto. And a quick Sort of shout out to the, Scottish government. So my my sister, Fiona, has Down syndrome. Mhmm.\n\nAnd the Scottish government, whom I'm often kicking, has actually Done really well by her. I mean, I think there's been fantastic support for her in getting her into work. I mean, she had a work coach. They, initially helped fund the company that employs her. And Fiona gets, I think, real fulfillment, out of the time that she spends in work.\n\nShe Goes to work every day, and I think the company that employs her is very good at supporting her. But I also think I hope they feel they get a lot out of her. So Tribute to the Scottish Government.\n\nSpeaker 0: On also, on, my Fiona, who has been to the Apple shop quite a few times recently, and on 2 occasions, as she's gone in and asked for to see somebody. They've said, do you mind having somebody helping you who's deaf? And she said, no. Not at all. And they did it all through an iPad.\n\nAnd these kids down in in Exmouth, they were when they were talking about what they want to do when they leave, it was just fantastic. 1 wanted to be a football coach, 1 wanted to work with dogs, 1 wanted to work with the museum.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, Adam van der Buscher, what 5 rules should STARMA put in place to improve governmental transparency, integrity, And in the end, regain trust in our corrupt solicitor. I'm gonna start. So rule number 1, ministers should serve a minimum of 2 years unless there's some Completely unprecedented scandal.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Number 2, they should have a 3 week training course before they take over with a proper handover. Number 3, I think, of course, we should change to something more like the New Zealand proportional representation Mhmm. System. I would like to see half the cabinet Being appointed people with real professional skills and knowledge of their areas\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, wonderful. Rather than just the bureaucracy.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then the final thing is I'd like to see much more They're called devolution down to a local level. Those are my 5. Okay. 30.\n\nSpeaker 0: I agree with most of those. The cabinet thing would be a massive change, and maybe we need that. First of all, I would like Keir to say in the manifesto, our politics is close to being broken. To repair it, we have to have a Fundamental rethink of how we do. Apologies at every level.\n\nI would love it if he said during the campaign, I want to put my shadow cabinet on notice If we become the cabinet, I can tell them now that if any of them ever stand at the dispatch box in the House of Commons and say something that is a lie, they will be sacked. And if there's something that is untrue or factually incorrect and they don't correct it immediately, they will also be sacked. I think that would really, really signal to people that he's serious about this. And I think the other thing is, I mean, I do recommend maybe we should put it you mentioned Angela Rayner in the in the main podcast. Maybe we should put this in the, in the newsletter.\n\nI I do think that some of the ideas that Anders Reinis is talking about in relation to rebuilding ethics. And the 7 Nolan principles Yep. Honesty, openness, objectivity, selfless, integrity, accountability, and leadership, I think Labour should persuade parliament to endorse those for all MPs.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay, Roy. Lots of questions to come. Let's just take a quick break.\n\nSpeaker 1: Helen Laws, what would your advice be on strategy to have the best chance Of getting a PR system of voting in to avoid the toxic polarizations ruining ruining Saudi. So if you were in charge of advising a campaign for Changing our electoral system, partial representation. How would you actually think about achieving it? And what is it realistically? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years?\n\nHow would you set about doing it?\n\nSpeaker 0: We talked a bit a little bit about this on the main podcast in relation to New Zealand. I do think that there's always a danger in a campaign where you feel it so strongly yourself that you can't quite understand why others don't. You have to get new voices. And so I think that the I do think that the Democrats and the Greens, who are the most committed to that sort of change. The the they should come together and actually start really pressing the Labour Party.\n\nBecause in the end, you can't change it without a government. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So they should be putting far more pressure on them.\n\nAnd I think doing it by saying, look, we'll help you get rid of the Tories if.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Question from you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I want just this. James Russell re Chris Cabbah. Why won't former Attorney general Suella Braverman beheld to account for her intervention. So this is where a police officer has been charged with murder, presumably after a pretty thorough process by the Crown Prosecution Service. You and I and nobody else knows more than what we've read and what we've seen.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and this this is where a lot of Firearm officers have handed back their weapons and protests in solidarity with these police officers.\n\nSpeaker 0: And Solely Braveman put out a statement on social media essentially saying we can't have a situation where situation where policemen go to work without feeling that you know, thinking they're gonna end up in court kind of thing, which if when I was a journalist, You just thought, oh, is that not contemptible?\n\nSpeaker 1: Interesting, isn't it? So we just talked to Theresa May about this in 2 episodes of Leading, which will be out on Monday. But One of the things that she was saying is that as home secretary, she was under huge pressure as a conservative to always support the police. Actually, she didn't. She's often been very, very Critical of police's home secretary.\n\nSular Brawman obviously made a different choice, which I guess is the kind of Republican American choice, which is ticket, to get it right\n\nSpeaker 0: or wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. I'm always on the side of the police, right or wrong.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I think there is a you know, it was interesting, the solicitor general put out a a media advisory note reminding the media and users of social media, he said, of the law concerning contempt of court. And I I have no idea whether that was in direct response\n\nSpeaker 1: to Wow.\n\nSpeaker 0: Swaddler Brabham member. I thought it was quite a big deal. It's quite a\n\nSpeaker 1: quite a big deal. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Another one for you, Rory. What did Rory discuss with Hamza Yousef? John in Oban wants to know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so Hamza Yousef and and I met,\n\nSpeaker 0: at the UN minister of Scotland?\n\nSpeaker 1: First minister of Scotland at the UN General Assembly. And, in fact, I met him just after I met the president of Malawi, and We were discussing Scotland's international development program. Scotland has a small international development program, but it's very, very interesting under Nicola Sturgeon and now continued under Hamster Yousef. They've been taking some very interesting leads, particularly on the issue of climate reparations and the issue of Really making sure that the people who are suffering most from climate change, the extreme poor of the world, get the support. That all the climate change money doesn't just go to technological change Converting people to renewable energy, but also thinks about the people in Somalia who are experiencing, you know, 7th year of droughts and are on the receiving end of this.\n\nAnd so, Yeah. I'm very interested in the way in which a smaller country like Scotland, can define the agenda in that way.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rachel, this is for your friend, Jillian Keegan. My daughter's secondary school has been closed for 4 weeks. There seems to be no plan for a return to appropriate face to face learning, And Department of Education embargoes on sharing information, meaning media attention has moved on. Does the government just react to what's in the public eye?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well and we've gone round round of this. I mean, this is the question of the fact that these buildings are unsafe. And so Gillian Keegan made the call just before term started to close schools to the absolute fury, obviously, understandably, of Parents, teachers, pupils who suddenly found just at the beginning of term that their school buildings were closed. I think It was the right thing to do, but I can also see why people are very angry about it.\n\nSpeaker 0: She did also say in parliament that the kids love being in porta cabins.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I was Porta cabin seating. Yeah. And the school that you keep going on about. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: You wear a porta cabin.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. My my all my dreams about that. My English class is from the porta cabin. No. It's been fine.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rather, you should have the last questions today.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Now my last question, I'm afraid it's it's less highbrow than some of the questions you've\n\nSpeaker 0: been trying. Trivial like you said this podcast was. No. No. No.\n\nAnother of your flutter eyebrow. Well, then can't you ever get your understanding? You you\n\nSpeaker 1: shouldn't listen to those things.\n\nSpeaker 0: You really wanna see them. I only listen to it because Elizabeth Day, the interviewee, sent me the clip saying this is hilarious. So you say just\n\nSpeaker 1: trying to wind you up.\n\nSpeaker 0: She she\n\nSpeaker 1: knows where your buttons are. So what Alastair's referring to and he I I've really offended him. And I actually I also really blame It's Dave for sharing all these clips because there's obviously no way Alison's gonna slog through listening to me on somebody else's podcast.\n\nSpeaker 0: I won't even go on to Shag Mary Avoid.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. But I'm I I've I've been publicizing my book, Politics on the Edge by doing a lot of podcasts. And and in them, basically, all I get asked about is The podcast. But you will be pleased that when I was on with Lorraine Kelly yesterday on ITV\n\nSpeaker 0: I love Lorraine.\n\nSpeaker 1: We did an enormous amount about the podcast. She's a huge fan, and that's Probably much bigger listeners than any of these things you're mocking me about. Mhmm. Now here we are.\n\nSpeaker 0: Richard Dean.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alastair, I'm not gonna answer this to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you a go to song that reenergizes you if you're feeling low in energy or uncertain?\n\nSpeaker 0: Any quite pacy Motown?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Go on. Give us an example.\n\nSpeaker 0: Anything from the 4 tops. Oh, ain't no mountain high enough. All always does it for me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Ain't no mountain high enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do in the gym?\n\nSpeaker 0: Any of the vast Albert stuff, A lot of Elvis\n\nSpeaker 1: Is there stuff you run to, box 2, or just cheers you up in the morning?\n\nSpeaker 0: Of the above.\n\nSpeaker 1: All of the above.\n\nSpeaker 0: All of the above.\n\nSpeaker 1: And do you play music very loud? Do your neighbors hate being next to you?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. My name is Lubbock, because I play the bagpipes very badly. I also I'll tell you the best running music of all time is the Bee Gees Live at Massachusetts. Go on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Give us a line of that.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Okay. No. I'm not.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Oh, that is so disappointing.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. But it's very hard to do the BGs. What about you? Go to music?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go to music. I I I\n\nSpeaker 0: You're just not into music, are you? No.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I'm not\n\nSpeaker 0: pronouncing music. Ridiculous. I'm not not your\n\nSpeaker 1: dude. Very it's I think it's probably because I'm tone deaf. It doesn't help much.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Okay. Is that true? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I I can I can't hold a tune? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'm not a great singer.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. No. I I and I it's the same with the pipes. I can play from music, but I can't play from here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, right. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is a big problem with vaccines.\n\nSpeaker 0: A major major problem. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. I I I literally I run to a recording of Handel's Messiah.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's a lie.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. It's true. Recorded by Do you? Yep. I do.\n\nRecorded by the 16 in Dublin, and I can show you the recording on my\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't mind that. I think that's I think that's okay. I think no. I think that's great. I don't mind that at all.\n\nI wouldn't do that, but then again, I was educated in the Porsche cabin.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Well, thank you very much.",
