Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And it's rather nice. It's another in person unusual in person thing. I I can report from the frontline that Alistair's wearing a rather kind of fat fetching sort of down waistcoat. Not a waistcoat. It's a It's a body warmer. They call it gilet? No. It's a body warmer, isn't it? I think it's a body warmer. Yeah. If you're in French, it'd be gilet, but it's a body warmer. A body warmer. It's a padded body warmer. Gotta remember, Rory, that I was in very, very, very cold water in the long run. You literally went in with the snow, didn't you? 3 degrees. Yeah. It was fantastic. That came out with Is there is there a temperature where it actually gets dangerous to do that, where your heart stops? When I jump in when it's really, really cold, because I'm used to it, I do sometimes think about if I wasn't used to this, you would panic because the shot you it's you feel like you're being stabbed. I know it sounds crazy that you want to do it, but and it's like when it when that feeling stops, it's quite nice, but that's when it's quite dangerous. So I only stayed in for I stayed in for 6 and a half minutes this morning. Right. But yeah. No. But it definitely wakes you up. Oh, you feel great afterwards. Yeah. Yeah. But cold cold. Is it a hot shower when you get up? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Okay. Should you ever read his question? Yeah. Go on then. Alastair Gela, Germany, What do you guys think would have happened if the German coup had been successful? And what does it tell us about how strong advanced democratic countries Actually, ah, so this is the German coup. Tell us a bit about the German coup. Well, a German attempted coup. On the one hand, I look at these people with their ridiculous names, Prince Heinrich the 13th from Reiss and somebody double bowled double bowled double bowled the 3rd, and all these, and then some ex commando guy. And and I think this is just absurd. But then you think, well, in 11 of the 16 lender, More than 3,000 police officers involved in simultaneous raids. There must have been something really quite serious with the tape. Weird, isn't it? They claim they raided Over a 150 properties, but they've only arrested 20 people. There seems to be a discrepancy. Well, so far, they've arrested 23 people. I think they were searching for They were searching for weapons, which they found. Right. They were obviously searching for documentation, which they found as well. But there is It's not that long ago. I think the thing that worried me was that I think was it Ursula von der Leyen who was still defense secretary, when there was a a part of the special forces that were shown to have very, very strong hard right links. And 1 and 1 part 1 branch of it has been shut down because they felt the whole thing had been infiltrated by the far right. Yeah. It's a bit weird, isn't it? And and this is also The the center of this seems to have been, part of it Thuringen. Thuringen, which was a part of East Germany. And and this Very, very peculiar man. His family I mean, he's actually a quite he's more of a big deal in Germany than than maybe people are reporting. Because on the one hand, his territory was tiny. His ancestors ruled the state, which was about 300 square miles, which is considerably smaller than Cumbria or Cornwall. But When I was going to Germany in the, I guess, early nineties, lots of people talked about it. And they're a very famous family because of this stupid Henry thing, which is that the Holy Roman emperor in the 12th century, Henry, gave them their land. And ever since then, every single one of them has to be called Henry. And more recently, prince Henry, and they number from the beginning of the century and Start again. So he's genuinely the 13th in that line? We saw it in the line. So he's in the 13th Henry this century from that family, But his father wasn't called the 13th. His father was called, you know, 4th or 5th. Another one of them, another one of the prince Henrys of Reuss is married to an abba singer Or was married to an ABBA singer. What? Yeah. That's why she's a princess. Yeah. So so I thought this this was important for you. So I I've been I don't know much about ABBA, but I've been been trying to get into Well, I know a lot about ABBA. Anna Fried was married to his cousin, who was another prince Heinrich. To Heinrich's cousin? Yeah. The one with the the Czech coat, another the the Tory hunting coach. Another prince Heinrich. Yeah. They're all called prince Heinrich because they all have to be called Heinrich regardless of which number they are. Every child has to be called Heinrich. This is feeling a bit cultist. It's kinda weird. Yeah. Anyway What about the the other name that that that stood out to me was Rudiger von Pescatore. A very good one. Like a sort of exotic dish that you would have some But that's the problem, isn't it? It's quite difficult to take it seriously with all the stuff going on. It is, but that's what I say that they they but they're they're very into this whole sort of they're they're anti vaxxers. They keep getting parking fines and and and, speedy offenses because they were they refused to acknowledge things like dry German federal drivers. They believe the German state, if I'm right, is a corporation. They refuse to call it a nation. It was set up by the allies after the 2nd World War to basically become a kind of a a a big retail center for American Americans. Massive McDonald's. Yeah. Exactly. So the so they kept So they don't recognize it. So so the center of their revolution It was a little town of 6, 7000 people, a bit that size of Creve where I come from in Scotland, where they were trying to convince everybody to sign up for the nation of Royce, which is this little princely state. And and it apparently, it was really weird because it's a tiny 7,000 people. So the local grocer would be like, did you get that note through your door saying you've got to sign up? And it But but in if they're just a bunch of cranks, though, you would not have 3 a half 1000 policemen police officers put on duty to go and get these guys, would you? Because I think the far right in Germany is you know, we see them occasionally in sort of football hooliganism. But, you know, last year, there were 55,000 politically motivated crimes in Germany, and 40 40 odd percent of those were seen as Crimes of the Hard Right. Right. So that's quite a lot. 38% neither right nor left. I don't I don't really know what that means. Yep. And this link into parts of the the military and parts of the 38% of them were aggressive centrists. Well, I'm a bit of an exec aggressive centrist Mazelbory as you go. I think we've done a really good job. You might find yourself in trouble. Yeah. Right. Here we are. Subodh Caffley, please can you cover the madness that's going on in Peru? In the 1st round, Castillo got 18% of the vote, while Fujimori got 13% of the vote. How mad that Peruvians ended up having to pick between the 2. And, of course, now we've had Castillo, the winner, gone. I think he's now in a jail. Yeah. He tried to do his own self coup d'etat. He did. And amazing so he was the president, and he suddenly decided He was gonna try to dissolve effectively this at parliament, and it all went wrong. I mean so there was a total sound of Castillo is extreme left wing populist, pretty poor background, very, very simple rural teacher, came up on the trade union movement, Seized power not seized power, was elective power, but this very narrow margin, as our question pointed out, found himself for the right wing parliament he was dealing with. Finally, after they tried to impeach him 2 or 3 times, he tried to shut them down. So complete constitutional coup like Trumpian beyond imagining. And he's now been toppled as you say, it's thrown in jail. Well, cabinet his cabinet didn't back him. The police didn't back him. The military didn't back him. It was it was not a very good coup. No. He's a rather sort of unfortunate figure. I mean, when you look at him, he does always look a bit hopeless. Yeah. Well, he's now in this in this jail that was built for his predecessor who's also see, they're they're now just the 2 of them in this these 2 former presidents in the jail together. And meanwhile, Dina Boloerta is the, his successor. And when you so is this the jail on the streets already. Is this the jail where Fujimori was also held? Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, it is also very interesting how much Latin American politics has changed quite quickly because, obviously, Fuhumori was very much part of the right. And when you were dealing with these These governments, Latin America through the late nineties, they were dominated by these very kind of big finance ministers who are very kind of orthodox Washington consensus, balance the budgets, export, foreign investment, hanging out with Gordon Brown at Davos. And now so many of these countries have gone to a form of popular selection. Yeah. But, yeah, I listen, the the, my my good friend, Moises Naeem, the three p's man. Absolutely. Yeah. I listened to he was on a podcast the other day about, Latin America. And was he from again? He's from Venezuela. That's right. Right. And he said, yes. There's lots of really bad off going in Venezuela. But he he said that in Guyana, dominant republic, and Panama, things are a lot better. And he and he And the guy who was interviewing him said, yeah. But and and the other ones he mentioned were Costa Rica and Uruguay. There are success stories in Latin America, they said. Meanwhile, Chile, Mexico where you go? Brazil. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Question for you. Hugh Ransom, I worry too much emphasis is put on what happens on Twitter. I personally take no issue with a politician who has no active presence on Twitter, and I don't believe their activity on such a platform makes any meaningful difference for their constituents or real life. Mhmm. And this was David Cameron's view back in the day. It's like people go on Twitter or twice. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's something in it. I think look. Funny if I did, after I had saw Marina Litvinenko yesterday, I was interviewed by Brian Moore, the former rugby player, because as part of his degree course. He's doing a big thing on social media. And we were talking about you know, the question was, why do I use Twitter? Okay? And I don't I've I've actually because of the Elon Musk thing, I've been sort of thinking, would my life really change that much if I wasn't on Twitter? Because I do find Musk pretty repellent, I must be honest. I I I don't write it. About prosecute Fauci was extraordinary. And he's he did there's the whole sort of attention seeking nature himself, and He talks absolute crap a lot of the time. So I was thinking about and and and I've I've definitely been engaging a lot less on Twitter. I've not been looking at Twitter as well. I tweet, so I'll probably promote tonight the Albert Hall thing. I'll probably do tree of the day? I always will do my tree of the day, but I could easily migrate that to somewhere else. Tree of the day can move to somewhere else? Yeah. So, you know a pity with Tree of the Day. I mean, it's Tree of the Day. So I don't I I think the that that question is at a point. So Twitter's a weird thing, isn't it? I so David Badiel has been off Twitter for a month, great comedian, and He was saying how wonderful it was. He's coming home, though, is it? Got got covered. Not coming home. Football's not coming home. Got a couple of couple of hours back in his life. But then he said, actually, there's also something that he really enjoys about it, and I do love it. I really love it. You you spend way too much time. I've been having some very happy conversations about Neolithic archaeology recently. And I don't know where else I'd have this conversation. Certainly not with you. You don't wanna talk to me about Neolithic archaeology. I'd I'd love to do it. Well, listen, here's 1 on Twitter, Rory. Does it show, says Erika Neustadt, does it show concern for the ever deepening climate emergency to fly yourself and your family to Doha to watch football? It's a good it's a good challenge. It's a very, very good challenge. I don't know what to say about that. I mean, I think I live next to Doha. I I don't care. I care. Live next to Doha, and I guess, you know, it's not like flying from Britain. So I'm flying from Amman to Doha. And I thought it would be a nice thing for little boys to see some football. That's fair. Okay. So Rory, Olivia Bright, remembering your by the way, did you see that I did tree Tree of the day from Cumbrian, the other day from your constituency. Spotted the spot. I think Good. If you still represented the Cumbrian constituency, where would you stand on the new Cumbrian coal mine? And now that you don't, does your position differ? I think it probably does differ. So to put the history of it, there were a small number of people in my constituency who were very, very Strongly against the coal mine, but the majority of people were very much in favor, and it was cross party. Because of jobs? Jobs. Labour and conservative. It's a relatively deprived air of West Cumbria, really struggling for economic activity and has been for a long time. And the coal mine was gonna create 500, I think, direct jobs, 1500 indirect jobs. And so I would have been very unpopular with all my local councilors and actually pretty unpopular with a lot of Labour voters and most of the working class voters in my constituency if I'd come out Heavily against the company. Had you been an MP, you'd have been in favor, but now you're not, you're against? I do. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm afraid It is impossible to square with our climate obligations. It just doesn't make any sense. That coal mine is supposed to be running till Nearly 2050, and we're supposed to be weaning off coal by the mid 2030s. And we're meant to be getting steel off coal, which is what this coal is used for. So It's a classic example of some and and it's also I think it must be uncomfortable for Labour too because, remember, Labour was very, very associated with fighting to keep coal mines open Absolutely. Which may be why there's a lot of labor support for reopening that coal mine in Cumbria. Let's just have right. Let's have a little break, and then we'll come back. Welcome back to the Restless Politics Question Time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Question for you. Vicki Pales, listening to the anthems of other nations at the World Cup has again highlighted how uninspiring, Brackets, musically, and out of date, lyrically, brackets, reign over us, god save the king is. Would you replace it? And what would you agree? It's a bit bit of a droning song. It's awful. It's awful. It's awful. I I one of my favorite Billy Connolly sketches was when he suggested replacing it with a theme tune for the archers. And what is what is it particularly awful? You just think It's a very boring, draining, draining, too. It's I think I think the It's a bit weird, isn't it? Because the Germans have, like, one of the greatest pieces of music ever. The French have an extraordinary The Italians, the Russians The Russians are amazing. Yeah. The American anthem's good. Yeah. And when you saw sorry to go on about the football, But when you saw I mean, fair play, the England players were all booming it out Yeah. But they were struggling a bit. You saw the French when they get to Marshall Marshall. I mean, it's, You know, it's proper. You're on the march. And I do think I hate to say this, and Marina if Marina Litvinenko was here now, she'd really give me one of those looks she gave me when we were talking about Tony Blair of Vladimir Putin. I mean, the Russian anthem is a bit special. What's so what so I think it would be look. The queen, RIP. God bless her. Charles, you know, they're trying to get what will Harry and Meghan doing the Netflix stuff? Why don't their whole family sort of Lead the charge for a new national anthem and turn into a fantastic reality TV show. Potentially, they could keep some of the same. There is no problem Saint God Save the King, but you could have a better tune, couldn't you? Yeah. But, also, I think the ones that have, you could definitely have a better tune. I mean, my god. You just wanna go to I wanna go to sleep when I hear it. And there's always good we take a bit of Handel, take a bit of Bach. Oh, no. I think we're gonna have a British composer, Rory. And for god's sake, we don't want the British for god's sake. I I honestly think a a modern national anthem, get in some get a citizen get a Citizens Assembly with Paul Riccardi, Adele, Ed Sheeran. And but You know, the the the l s the l s o And you really think this should be look. You're not gonna get in ABBA to do it. You've really decided this gonna be British led. Yeah. I think so. I think so. Let's have a natural eyes, which I don't think they will. They're very, very Swedish. Now I I had Let let let what about it? Let let's just do this one. Right? Hillary Newton, have Alastair and Rory watched the Harry and Meghan programs? I'm a no. I mean, yes. Oh, wow. If so, does anything that anything in it justify the bile and hatred being thrown at them by the British press? Why do the Palace press officers continue to support papers who so debase British society and social cohesion? So you've watched it? Yeah. I I watched the 1st episode. I mean, I I it's a very difficult thing for me. On on the one hand, I think that they I I I I it's it's tricky. I mean, I I feel for Prince Harry. I think that and he comes across in it as very, broken and understandably very shaken up by his mother's death, by his relationship with the media. I mean, Basically, the program is about his hatred of how intrusive the media was in every element of his life. And one of the subtexts of it Seems to be a sense that the royal family has felt for a long time that to maintain that position in British society, they almost need to be in the press All the time. Is is do do you think that's I mean, to somebody who really understands the press, is that true? Is it actually true that to maintain their relevance and popularity, It is useful for them to be covered almost every day, not just once a year. Not necessarily every day, but I I think they well, first of all, I think you're a 100% right, And I've talked to him and to William about this. I think they I think William hides it very well. I think they despise much of the British media and much of the world's media, and I think it is a lot of it about about their mother. I think they do feel and that's why the queen's death was planned to the extent that it was and the funeral and the all that followed. I think they do feel that without that permanent sense of relevance and connection with the British people that they they feel very, very vulnerable. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Do you feel this and this is a question I've always wanna Do do you feel that it's true for you too that it's important for you personally as an individual, for your brand as it were, to be in the media regularly, sort of in every week or so. What would happen if you vanished for 6 months? Would it affect how well known you were or not? Or Yeah. Probably. But I don't I don't I don't I mean, I'm I'm thinking about a bit like you. I say no to way, way, way more things than I say yes to. But I think I think like, look. To be honest, this podcast has giving both of us a whole new kind of sense of a different sort of profile. I think now I see my I see my profile developing through stuff Longer form stuff like books, films, I don't feel the need to be in the papers at all. I don't care if I'm in the papers. I really have no interest What's interesting, I've got colleagues like, I've I've mentioned some of them. Mark Francois, for example, was often in the newspapers British British MP, Brexit voting MP. But I felt that often, they would be in the post slot, but people wouldn't necessarily particularly remember their names. I'm not sure the MPs appearing occasionally. It's amazing how it's amazing how quickly MPs get forgotten as well. That's where you do need to kinda reinvent and do different things. I I've noticed a lot of MPs who just they've you know, I I I won't I'm not gonna say it was embarrassing, but I saw recently a member of our cabinet walking down the road. I was in sitting watching them in a cafe, and I walked and literally nobody batted an eyelid. And not that long ago, they were quite a senior cabinet minister. Question from Sally Davis, maybe to end. I don't know whether this is Dame Sally Davis, the great person who used to be the public health chief of England Could be. Predecessor Chris Witty. She says I used to despise ironing ironing. I now listen to the rest of this politics podcast while ironing. So I now look actively forward to it to the point that I even iron sheets so I can listen for longer. What examples do Rory and Alastair have of positive associations? Initially, I thought she meant iron sheets in the sense of wriggly tin on a roof. No. She means on a ironing board. Yep. She means Ironing board as you seem to think he calls it. Associations. I'll tell you. If only the when I ran the marathon in 2003, I I thought why this popped up my head when you passed the question. By the way, I don't think that is Sally Davis. I don't I think if she'd asked I I think Dame Sally Davis, she might ask That, I don't know. I they if it is Dame Sally Davis, ex of National Health Service, please let us know. And if it's not, please let us know a little bit more about your life other than your eye opening. But when I cross the line, this shows you how marketing stuff works. Somebody put a can of Luca a bottle of LucasArd into my hand. Very smart. And now whenever I finish I think you you want one of those. I want I want a drink of liquor soda. What are the words stuck in people's heads with sheets? Maybe that's the thing. I I I think the other thing I do is I I never I don't know if this is the same thing, but I once Put my left shoe on before my right shoe. Yep. And later that day, I fell down the stairs. And now you never do it again? So since then, I've Always. I will always put my right shoe on first. But you can see that with Footballers Country. You can see that with Harry Kane taking the penalty that there were obviously some rituals to do with his socks and stuff. I think they get these very, very big and and then, of course, the other thing I picked up, which must be your life all the time, is the sense which you as a viewer, in my case, sitting in MRN Jordan watch on the screen. I begin to worry that something I'm doing in the room when I'm watching screen is gonna affect his ability to get it into the goal. All the time. All the time. Which is quite mad because it's like umpteen 1000000 people watching. It's totally insane. However, I'll tell you where I think it happens. So, like, Here's 1. Right. Let's say you might have gone to the game. Yep. Okay? So when they announced the crowd Yep. Right, And they said, tonight's attendance is 614,413. If you'd have gone Yep. It would have been 614. Yep. One of the players might have reacted slightly differently on that piece of information to had it been 1 fewer. That's the kind of inactive butterfly effect. I gen look. I'll tell you the other thing. Queens Park Rangers on Sunday when Burnley because real football was back in the weekend, Rory. Burnley away at Queens Park Rangers. And I went I actually went with Charles Kennedy's son, Donald, who, unlike Charles, is quite a football fan. And, and I said to him, just before we scored our 2nd goal, I said, I think if I put my gloves on, something might happen. Gloves went on. We scored. Unbelievable. Yeah? Right. Rory, I've got to tell you, this is from Carl Seba, your six word description of why you're still a conservative. It went down Very fast. If I can make 5 words like a bag of sick. Yep. So you included tradition. Now I've I was a bit pissed off with that because and the one that really pissed me off was landscape. Yeah. I've loved landscape all my life. So why do you think Tories have a hold on this? And so he says, could you give some examples of British traditions you are particularly attached to and that your worry will be under threat when, says Carl, I think we know his political colors, when the conservatives leave office. This is a really Sensitive thing, and it's a difficult thing. But if I think about why I became a conservative rather than Labour and I remember being teased by Tristan Hunt about it. It was a Labour MP. Basically, instinctively, my whole life, I grew up in a very different way, revering Lots of bits of British history. I revered the monarchy, revered the British army, huge admiration for British history. And, Definitely, if I looked across the labor benches and talked about the kind of books I read, the kind of films I watched, Going with my father to Remembrance Day parades as a late year old standing there with my little red poppy on Saluting. This wasn't the life of most of the Labour MPs across the aisle. And the things that I cared about, many of my, Troy MPs deeply romantic about British regiments, for example, about the abolition of the black watch. I didn't know any Labour MP who was deeply motivated by the question of whether or not the black watch Now you might be a bit different. You had a brother in the Scots Guards, but it's the same. I just sort of feel that my emotional reaction to those things, Like the monarchy is is different from the kind of martial reaction. Yeah. But the question Carl's asking is what which of those traditions would go if the conservatives weren't there? Well, what what I think I think Labour are very committed to the military. Oh, funny. I don't know why. When you were speaking, Neil Kinnett popped into my head. And I can see Neil absolutely making speeches about that stuff. Yeah. I think he well, he he was very much, I mean, and he instinctively He's a very strong working class patriotic. Yeah. But but it's but equally, that's obviously not the tradition of Jeremy Corbyn. Very much not. I mean, he definitely would not feel emotionally in the way that I do when I walk in the remembrance day of Brexit. Reminded us on the radio this morning, Jeremy Corbyn is not the prime minister. No. He's He's he's definitely not prime minister. So I think conservative I mean, the clue is in the name that, really, we're about conserving things, And I think Labour has tended to feel that you're a Tory? Do you still feel Tory? Well, I I didn't like this government, but I'm still on the Old fashioned, traditional conserving side of things. I like so when I talk about landscape, I'm talking about protecting and conserving what I love in the Cumbrian landscape. I'm and And this is why I disagree with people like Michael Gove. Michael Gove's yeah. He's in the conservative party, but he's a radical. Mhmm. He's a radical, whiggish liberal. He's a yeah. Chris Colpin, Rory less landscape is one of the reasons he's a Tory. I don't understand this. I love and understand the Marlborough's British landscape, but It doesn't come near to making a Tory, rather the reverse because restrictive land ownership and capitalist farming have done so much damage to our landscapes. Well, that's again where where I probably disagree. So the Cumbrian landscape that I love What about land ownership, though? Come on. Well, it's part part part part part land ownership. I I love, Actually, the patchwork of family owned farms right away across Cumbria. I love the combination of sheep pasture with wilderness, And I'm very, very suspicious, and I've gotten lots of trouble with this. In fact, someone's just written a book, who was the RSPB attacking me for this, with the rewilding movement, both on the right and on the left, And their attempt to transform the landscape into something it hasn't looked like for 2 a half 1000 years. Mhmm. 1 of 1 of I remember my cousin giving me a a book Who owns Scotland? A few years ago. I don't know if you read it. Yeah. I I've I've got got a copy of it. I bet you. It's all in it. It's all my neighbors. It's all my neighbors. Yeah. I mean, it's just like it's a very, very, very small number of very, very, very, very wealthy people. Last 1. Okay. Last 1. Part of the problem this is George Clare. Part of the problem in British politics is that the prime minister and principal secretaries of state must balance their work as government ministers ticket. With their workers' MPs representing a geographical constituency. If we were to transition to party list system, the PM could focus on the departments and delegate the parliamentary responsibilities matters to the next candidate duly elected on the list. System already operates in successful democracies such as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Would this work for the UK? Similar question, Oles, been watching TV show Borgen recently, Danish political drama. Do you think UK would benefit from a multiparty system which no one party can hold absolute power? Similar area. I'd I'd well, I don't buy the idea that just because you're a minister, you can't be an MP. I mean, yes, it adds to the workload, But at the same time, I think it's a really, really important point of connection. And you have to be good at delegating and good at building systems and making sure you got people keeping everything tracked for you. So I guess deep down, that's a question from somebody who wants to change the electoral system. Well, I think it's also deep down from something that I felt with my switches. They couldn't understand how you could have a full time job as a constituency MP and then suddenly become a cabinet minister working full time on running the health service. How could you have 2 full time jobs? And the answer had to be that 1 or the other was gonna have to suffer. You can't do everything. But I think we should close with this one. John Thompson. Now we can give very this is a really complicated question, but I think we should give a 1 sentence answer to it. You can only choose 1 of the following. Which is it and why? Burnley gained promotion until 2030, which means they win the triple. Global extreme poverty eradicated. Carbon emissions at net zero or slightly negative, global female education levels the same as male, all populist charlatans are brought to justice. I'd go for Burnley. You're lying. You're lying. Okay. Let's leave it at that then.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's rather nice. It's another in person unusual in person thing. I I can report from the frontline that Alistair's wearing a rather kind of fat fetching sort of down waistcoat.\n\nSpeaker 0: Not a waistcoat. It's a It's a body warmer.\n\nSpeaker 1: They call it gilet?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. It's a body warmer, isn't it? I think it's a body warmer. Yeah. If you're in French, it'd be gilet, but it's a body warmer.\n\nA body warmer. It's a padded body warmer. Gotta remember, Rory, that I was in very, very, very cold water in\n\nSpeaker 1: the long run. You literally went in with the snow, didn't you?\n\nSpeaker 0: 3 degrees. Yeah. It was fantastic. That came out\n\nSpeaker 1: with Is there is there a temperature where it actually gets dangerous to do that, where your heart stops?\n\nSpeaker 0: When I jump in when it's really, really cold, because I'm used to it, I do sometimes think about if I wasn't used to this, you would panic because the shot you it's you feel like you're being stabbed. I know it sounds crazy that you want to do it, but and it's like when it when that feeling stops, it's quite nice, but that's when it's quite dangerous. So I only stayed in for I stayed in for 6 and a half minutes this morning. Right. But yeah.\n\nNo.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it definitely wakes you up.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, you feel great afterwards. Yeah. Yeah. But cold cold. Is it\n\nSpeaker 1: a hot shower when you get up?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Should you ever read his question? Yeah. Go on then.\n\nAlastair Gela, Germany, What do you guys think would have happened if the German coup had been successful? And what does it tell us about how strong advanced democratic countries Actually, ah, so this is the German coup. Tell us a bit about the German coup.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, a German attempted coup. On the one hand, I look at these people with their ridiculous names, Prince Heinrich the 13th from Reiss and somebody double bowled double bowled double bowled the 3rd, and all these, and then some ex commando guy. And and I think this is just absurd. But then you think, well, in 11 of the 16 lender, More than 3,000 police officers involved in simultaneous raids. There must have been something really quite serious\n\nSpeaker 1: with the tape. Weird, isn't it? They claim they raided Over a 150 properties, but they've only arrested 20 people. There seems to be a discrepancy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, so far, they've arrested 23 people. I think they were searching for They were searching for weapons, which they found.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: They were obviously searching for documentation, which they found as well. But there is It's not that long ago. I think the thing that worried me was that I think was it Ursula von der Leyen who was still defense secretary, when there was a a part of the special forces that were shown to have very, very strong hard right links. And 1 and 1 part 1 branch of it has been shut down because they felt the whole thing had been infiltrated by the far right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's a bit weird, isn't it? And and this is also The the center of this seems to have been, part of it Thuringen. Thuringen, which was a part of East Germany. And and this Very, very peculiar man.\n\nHis family I mean, he's actually a quite he's more of a big deal in Germany than than maybe people are reporting. Because on the one hand, his territory was tiny. His ancestors ruled the state, which was about 300 square miles, which is considerably smaller than Cumbria or Cornwall. But When I was going to Germany in the, I guess, early nineties, lots of people talked about it. And they're a very famous family because of this stupid Henry thing, which is that the Holy Roman emperor in the 12th century, Henry, gave them their land.\n\nAnd ever since then, every single one of them has to be called Henry. And more recently, prince Henry, and they number from the beginning of the century and Start again.\n\nSpeaker 0: So he's genuinely the 13th in that line?\n\nSpeaker 1: We saw it in the line. So he's in the 13th Henry this century from that family, But his father wasn't called the 13th. His father was called, you know, 4th or 5th. Another one of them, another one of the prince Henrys of Reuss is married to an abba singer Or was married to an ABBA singer.\n\nSpeaker 0: What?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's why she's a princess. Yeah. So so I thought this this was important for you. So I I've been I don't know much about ABBA, but I've been been trying to get into\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I know a lot about ABBA.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anna Fried was married to his cousin, who was another prince Heinrich.\n\nSpeaker 0: To Heinrich's cousin? Yeah. The one with the the Czech coat, another the the Tory hunting coach.\n\nSpeaker 1: Another prince Heinrich. Yeah. They're all called prince Heinrich because they all have to be called Heinrich regardless of which number they are. Every child has to be called Heinrich.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is feeling a bit cultist.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's kinda weird. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Anyway What about the the other name that that that stood out to me was Rudiger von Pescatore.\n\nSpeaker 1: A very good one.\n\nSpeaker 0: Like a sort of exotic dish that you would have some\n\nSpeaker 1: But that's the problem, isn't it? It's quite difficult to take it seriously with all the stuff going on.\n\nSpeaker 0: It is, but that's what I say that they they but they're they're very into this whole sort of they're they're anti vaxxers. They keep getting parking fines and and and, speedy offenses because they were they refused to acknowledge things like dry German federal drivers.\n\nSpeaker 1: They believe the German state, if I'm right, is a corporation. They refuse to call it a nation.\n\nSpeaker 0: It was set up by the allies after the 2nd World War to basically become a kind of a a a big retail center for American Americans.\n\nSpeaker 1: Massive McDonald's.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the so they kept\n\nSpeaker 0: So they don't recognize it.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so the center of their revolution It was a little town of 6, 7000 people, a bit that size of Creve where I come from in Scotland, where they were trying to convince everybody to sign up for the nation of Royce, which is this little princely state. And and it apparently, it was really weird because it's a tiny 7,000 people. So the local grocer would be like, did you get that note through your door saying you've got to sign up?\n\nSpeaker 0: And it But but in if they're just a bunch of cranks, though, you would not have 3 a half 1000 policemen police officers put on duty to go and get these guys, would you? Because I think the far right in Germany is you know, we see them occasionally in sort of football hooliganism. But, you know, last year, there were 55,000 politically motivated crimes in Germany, and 40 40 odd percent of those were seen as Crimes of the Hard Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: So that's quite a lot. 38% neither right nor left. I don't I don't really know what that means. Yep. And this link into parts of the the military and parts of the\n\nSpeaker 1: 38% of them were aggressive centrists.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'm a bit of an exec aggressive centrist Mazelbory as you go.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think we've done a really good job. You might find yourself in trouble. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Here we are. Subodh Caffley, please can you cover the madness that's going on in Peru? In the 1st round, Castillo got 18% of the vote, while Fujimori got 13% of the vote. How mad that Peruvians ended up having to pick between the 2.\n\nAnd, of course, now we've had Castillo, the winner, gone. I think he's now in a jail.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. He tried to do his own self coup d'etat. He did. And amazing so he was the president, and he suddenly decided He was gonna try to dissolve effectively this at parliament, and it all went wrong. I mean so there was a total sound of Castillo is extreme left wing populist, pretty poor background, very, very simple rural teacher, came up on the trade union movement, Seized power not seized power, was elective power, but this very narrow margin, as our question pointed out, found himself for the right wing parliament he was dealing with.\n\nFinally, after they tried to impeach him 2 or 3 times, he tried to shut them down. So complete constitutional coup like Trumpian beyond imagining. And he's now been toppled as you say, it's thrown in jail.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, cabinet his cabinet didn't back him. The police didn't back him. The military didn't back him. It was it was not a very good coup. No.\n\nHe's a rather\n\nSpeaker 1: sort of unfortunate figure. I mean, when you look at him, he does always look a bit hopeless.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, he's now in this in this jail that was built for his predecessor who's also see, they're they're now just the 2 of them in this these 2 former presidents in the jail together. And meanwhile, Dina Boloerta is the, his successor. And when\n\nSpeaker 1: you so is this the jail on the streets already. Is this the jail where Fujimori was also held?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, it is also very interesting how much Latin American politics has changed quite quickly because, obviously, Fuhumori was very much part of the right. And when you were dealing with these These governments, Latin America through the late nineties, they were dominated by these very kind of big finance ministers who are very kind of orthodox Washington consensus, balance the budgets, export, foreign investment, hanging out with Gordon Brown at Davos. And now so many of these countries have gone to a form of popular selection.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But, yeah, I listen, the the, my my good friend, Moises Naeem, the three p's man.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I listened to he was on a podcast the other day about, Latin America.\n\nSpeaker 1: And was he from again?\n\nSpeaker 0: He's from Venezuela.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right. Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: And he said, yes. There's lots of really bad off going in Venezuela. But he he said that in Guyana, dominant republic, and Panama, things are a lot\n\nSpeaker 1: better. And\n\nSpeaker 0: he and he And the guy who was interviewing him said, yeah. But and and the other ones he mentioned were Costa Rica and Uruguay. There are success stories in Latin America, they said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Meanwhile, Chile, Mexico\n\nSpeaker 0: where you go?\n\nSpeaker 1: Brazil. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Question for you.\n\nHugh Ransom, I worry too much emphasis is put on what happens on Twitter. I personally take no issue with a politician who has no active presence on Twitter, and I don't believe their activity on such a platform makes any meaningful difference for their constituents or real life.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this was David Cameron's view back in the day. It's like people go on Twitter or twice.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. I think there's something in it. I think look. Funny if I did, after I had saw Marina Litvinenko yesterday, I was interviewed by Brian Moore, the former rugby player, because as part of his degree course.\n\nHe's doing a big thing on social media. And we were talking about you know, the question was, why do I use Twitter? Okay? And I don't I've I've actually because of the Elon Musk thing, I've been sort of thinking, would my life really change that much if I wasn't on Twitter? Because I do find Musk pretty repellent, I must be honest.\n\nI I I don't\n\nSpeaker 1: write it. About prosecute Fauci was extraordinary.\n\nSpeaker 0: And he's he did there's the whole sort of attention seeking nature himself, and He talks absolute crap a lot of the time. So I was thinking about and and and I've I've definitely been engaging a lot less on Twitter. I've not been looking at Twitter as well. I tweet, so I'll probably promote tonight the Albert Hall thing. I'll probably do\n\nSpeaker 1: tree of the day?\n\nSpeaker 0: I always will do my tree of the day, but I could easily migrate that to somewhere else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tree of the day can move to somewhere else?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So, you know a\n\nSpeaker 1: pity with Tree of the Day.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: it's Tree of the Day.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I don't I I think the that that question is at a point.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Twitter's a weird thing, isn't it? I so David Badiel has been off Twitter for a month, great comedian, and He was saying how wonderful it was. He's\n\nSpeaker 0: coming home, though, is it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Got got covered. Not coming home. Football's not coming home. Got a couple of couple of hours back in his life. But then he said, actually, there's also something that he really enjoys about it, and I do love it.\n\nI really love it.\n\nSpeaker 0: You you spend way too much time.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've been having some very happy conversations about Neolithic archaeology recently. And I don't know where else I'd have this conversation. Certainly not with you. You don't wanna talk to me about\n\nSpeaker 0: Neolithic archaeology. I'd I'd love to do it. Well, listen, here's 1 on Twitter, Rory. Does it show, says Erika Neustadt, does it show concern for the ever deepening climate emergency to fly yourself and your family to Doha to watch football?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a good it's a good challenge. It's a very, very good challenge. I don't know what to say about that. I mean, I think I live next to Doha. I I don't care.\n\nI care. Live next to Doha, and I guess, you know, it's not like flying from Britain. So I'm flying from Amman to Doha. And I thought it would be a nice thing for little boys to see some football.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's fair. Okay. So Rory, Olivia Bright, remembering your by the way, did you see that I did tree Tree of the day from Cumbrian, the other\n\nSpeaker 1: day from\n\nSpeaker 0: your constituency.\n\nSpeaker 1: Spotted the spot. I think Good.\n\nSpeaker 0: If you still represented the Cumbrian constituency, where would you stand on the new Cumbrian coal mine? And now that you don't, does your position differ?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it probably does differ. So to put the history of it, there were a small number of people in my constituency who were very, very Strongly against the coal mine, but the majority of people were very much in favor, and it was cross party.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because of jobs?\n\nSpeaker 1: Jobs. Labour and conservative. It's a relatively deprived air of West Cumbria, really struggling for economic activity and has been for a long time. And the coal mine was gonna create 500, I think, direct jobs, 1500 indirect jobs. And so I would have been very unpopular with all my local councilors and actually pretty unpopular with a lot of Labour voters and most of the working class voters in my constituency if I'd come out Heavily against the company.\n\nSpeaker 0: Had you been an MP, you'd have been in favor, but now you're not, you're against?\n\nSpeaker 1: I do. Yeah. I'm I'm I'm afraid It is impossible to square with our climate obligations. It just doesn't make any sense. That coal mine is supposed to be running till Nearly 2050, and we're supposed to be weaning off coal by the mid 2030s.\n\nAnd we're meant to be getting steel off coal, which is what this coal is used for. So It's a classic example of some and and it's also I think it must be uncomfortable for Labour too because, remember, Labour was very, very associated with fighting to keep coal mines open Absolutely. Which may be why there's a lot of labor support for reopening that coal mine in Cumbria.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's just have right. Let's have a little break, and then we'll come back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome back to the Restless Politics Question Time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Question for you. Vicki Pales, listening to the anthems of other nations at the World Cup has again highlighted how uninspiring, Brackets, musically, and out of date, lyrically, brackets, reign over us, god save the king is. Would you replace it?\n\nAnd what would you agree? It's a bit bit of a droning song.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's awful. It's awful. It's awful. I I one of my favorite Billy Connolly sketches was when he suggested replacing it with a theme tune for the archers.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what\n\nSpeaker 0: is what\n\nSpeaker 1: is it particularly awful? You just think It's a very boring, draining, draining, too.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's I think I think the\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a bit weird, isn't it? Because the Germans have, like, one of the greatest pieces of music ever. The French have an extraordinary\n\nSpeaker 0: The Italians, the Russians\n\nSpeaker 1: The Russians are amazing. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: The American anthem's good. Yeah. And when you saw sorry to go on about the football, But when you saw I mean, fair play, the England players were all booming it out Yeah. But they were struggling a bit. You saw the French when they get to Marshall Marshall.\n\nI mean, it's, You know, it's proper. You're on the march. And I do think I hate to say this, and Marina if Marina Litvinenko was here now, she'd really give me one of those looks she gave me when we were talking about Tony Blair of Vladimir Putin. I mean, the Russian anthem is a bit special. What's so what so I think it would be look.\n\nThe queen, RIP. God bless her. Charles, you know, they're trying to get what will Harry and Meghan doing the Netflix stuff? Why don't their whole family sort of Lead the charge for a new national anthem and turn into a fantastic reality TV show.\n\nSpeaker 1: Potentially, they could keep some of the same. There is no problem Saint God Save the King, but you could have a better tune, couldn't you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But, also, I think the ones that have, you could definitely have a better tune. I mean, my god. You just wanna go to I wanna go to sleep when I hear it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And there's always good we take a bit of Handel, take a bit\n\nSpeaker 0: of Bach. Oh, no. I think we're gonna have a British composer, Rory. And for god's sake, we don't want the British for god's sake. I I honestly think a a modern national anthem, get in some get a citizen get a Citizens Assembly with Paul Riccardi, Adele, Ed Sheeran.\n\nSpeaker 1: And but\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, the the the l s the l s o\n\nSpeaker 1: And you really think this should be look. You're not gonna get in ABBA to do it. You've really decided this gonna be British led.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think so. I think so. Let's have a natural eyes, which I don't think they will. They're very, very Swedish.\n\nNow I I had Let let let what about it? Let let's just do this one. Right? Hillary Newton, have Alastair and Rory watched the Harry and Meghan programs? I'm a no.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, wow. If so, does anything that anything in it justify the bile and hatred being thrown at them by the British press? Why do the Palace press officers continue to support papers who so debase British society and social cohesion? So you've watched it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I I watched the 1st episode. I mean, I I it's a very difficult thing for me. On on the one hand, I think that they I I I I it's it's tricky. I mean, I I feel for Prince Harry.\n\nI think that and he comes across in it as very, broken and understandably very shaken up by his mother's death, by his relationship with the media. I mean, Basically, the program is about his hatred of how intrusive the media was in every element of his life. And one of the subtexts of it Seems to be a sense that the royal family has felt for a long time that to maintain that position in British society, they almost need to be in the press All the time. Is is do do you think that's I mean, to somebody who really understands the press, is that true? Is it actually true that to maintain their relevance and popularity, It is useful for them to be covered almost every day, not just once a year.\n\nSpeaker 0: Not necessarily every day, but I I think they well, first of all, I think you're a 100% right, And I've talked to him and to William about this. I think they I think William hides it very well. I think they despise much of the British media and much of the world's media, and I think it is a lot of it about about their mother. I think they do feel and that's why the queen's death was planned to the extent that it was and the funeral and the all that followed. I think they do feel that without that permanent sense of relevance and connection with the British people that they they feel very, very vulnerable.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.\n\nRight. Right. Do you feel this and this is a question I've always wanna Do do you feel that it's true for you too that it's important for you personally as an individual, for your brand as it were, to be in the media regularly, sort of in every week or so. What would happen if you vanished for 6 months? Would it affect how well known you were or not?\n\nOr\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Probably. But I don't I don't I don't I mean, I'm I'm thinking about a bit like you. I say no to way, way, way more things than I say yes to. But I think I think like, look.\n\nTo be honest, this podcast has giving both of us a whole new kind of sense of a different sort of profile. I think now I see my I see my profile developing through stuff Longer form stuff like books, films, I don't feel the need to be in the papers at all. I don't care if I'm in the papers. I really have no interest\n\nSpeaker 1: What's interesting, I've got colleagues like, I've I've mentioned some of them. Mark Francois, for example, was often in the newspapers British British MP, Brexit voting MP. But I felt that often, they would be in the post slot, but people wouldn't necessarily particularly remember their names. I'm not sure the MPs appearing occasionally.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's amazing how it's amazing how quickly MPs get forgotten as well. That's where you do need to kinda reinvent and do different things. I I've noticed a lot of MPs who just they've you know, I I I won't I'm not gonna say it was embarrassing, but I saw recently a member of our cabinet walking down the road. I was in sitting watching them in a cafe, and I walked and literally nobody batted an eyelid. And not that long ago, they were quite a senior cabinet minister.\n\nSpeaker 1: Question from Sally Davis, maybe to end. I don't know whether this is Dame Sally Davis, the great person who used to be the public health chief of England\n\nSpeaker 0: Could be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Predecessor Chris Witty. She says I used to despise ironing ironing. I now listen to the rest of this politics podcast while ironing. So I now look actively forward to it to the point that I even iron sheets so I can listen for longer. What examples do Rory and Alastair have of positive associations?\n\nInitially, I thought she meant iron sheets in the sense of wriggly tin on a roof.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. She means on a ironing board.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. She means\n\nSpeaker 0: Ironing board as you seem to think he calls it. Associations. I'll tell you. If only the when I ran the marathon in 2003, I I thought why this popped up my head when you passed the question. By the way, I don't think that is Sally Davis.\n\nI don't I think if she'd asked I\n\nSpeaker 2: I think Dame Sally Davis,\n\nSpeaker 0: she might ask That, I don't know. I they if it is Dame Sally Davis, ex of National Health Service, please let us know. And if it's not, please let us know a little bit more about your life other than your eye opening. But when I cross the line, this shows you how marketing stuff works. Somebody put a can of Luca a bottle of LucasArd into my hand.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very smart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And now whenever I finish\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you you want one of those.\n\nSpeaker 0: I want I want a drink of liquor soda.\n\nSpeaker 1: What are the words stuck in people's heads with sheets? Maybe that's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I I think the other thing I do is I I never I don't know if this is the same thing, but I once Put my left shoe on before my right shoe. Yep. And later that day, I fell down the stairs.\n\nSpeaker 1: And now you never do it again?\n\nSpeaker 0: So since then, I've Always. I will always put my right shoe on first.\n\nSpeaker 1: But you can see that with Footballers Country. You can see that with Harry Kane taking the penalty that there were obviously some rituals to do with his socks and stuff. I think they get these very, very big and and then, of course, the other thing I picked up, which must be your life all the time, is the sense which you as a viewer, in my case, sitting in MRN Jordan watch on the screen. I begin to worry that something I'm doing in the room when I'm watching screen is gonna affect his ability to get it into the goal.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the time. All the time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is quite mad because it's like umpteen 1000000 people watching.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's totally insane. However, I'll tell you where I think it happens. So, like, Here's 1. Right. Let's say you might have gone to the game.\n\nYep. Okay? So when they announced the crowd Yep. Right, And they said, tonight's attendance is 614,413. If you'd have gone Yep.\n\nIt would have been 614. Yep. One of the players might have reacted slightly differently on that piece of information to had it been 1 fewer. That's the kind of inactive butterfly effect. I gen look.\n\nI'll tell you the other thing. Queens Park Rangers on Sunday when Burnley because real football was back in the weekend, Rory. Burnley away at Queens Park Rangers. And I went I actually went with Charles Kennedy's son, Donald, who, unlike Charles, is quite a football fan. And, and I said to him, just before we scored our 2nd goal, I said, I think if I put my gloves on, something might happen.\n\nGloves went on. We scored. Unbelievable. Yeah? Right.\n\nRory, I've got to tell you, this is from Carl Seba, your six word description of why you're still a conservative. It went down\n\nSpeaker 1: Very fast.\n\nSpeaker 0: If I can make 5 words like a bag of sick. Yep. So you included tradition. Now I've I was a bit pissed off with that because and the one that really pissed me off was landscape. Yeah.\n\nI've loved landscape all my life. So why do you think Tories have a hold on this? And so he says, could you give some examples of British traditions you are particularly attached to and that your worry will be under threat when, says Carl, I think we know his political colors, when the conservatives leave office.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is a really Sensitive thing, and it's a difficult thing. But if I think about why I became a conservative rather than Labour and I remember being teased by Tristan Hunt about it. It was a Labour MP. Basically, instinctively, my whole life, I grew up in a very different way, revering Lots of bits of British history. I revered the monarchy, revered the British army, huge admiration for British history.\n\nAnd, Definitely, if I looked across the labor benches and talked about the kind of books I read, the kind of films I watched, Going with my father to Remembrance Day parades as a late year old standing there with my little red poppy on Saluting. This wasn't the life of most of the Labour MPs across the aisle. And the things that I cared about, many of my, Troy MPs deeply romantic about British regiments, for example, about the abolition of the black watch. I didn't know any Labour MP who was deeply motivated by the question of whether or not the black watch Now you might be a bit different. You had a brother in the Scots Guards, but it's the same.\n\nI just sort of feel that my emotional reaction to those things, Like the monarchy is is different from the kind of martial reaction.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But the question Carl's asking is what which of those traditions would go if the conservatives weren't there? Well, what what I think I think Labour are very committed to the military. Oh, funny. I don't know why.\n\nWhen you were speaking, Neil Kinnett popped into my head. And I can see Neil absolutely making speeches about that stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think he well, he he was very much, I mean, and he instinctively\n\nSpeaker 0: He's a very strong working class patriotic.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. But but it's but equally, that's obviously not the tradition of Jeremy Corbyn. Very much not. I mean, he definitely would not feel emotionally in the way that I do when I walk in the remembrance day\n\nSpeaker 0: of Brexit. Reminded us on the radio this morning, Jeremy Corbyn is not the prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. He's He's he's definitely not prime minister. So I think conservative I mean, the clue is in the name that, really, we're about conserving things, And I think Labour has tended\n\nSpeaker 0: to feel that you're a Tory? Do you still feel Tory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I didn't like this government, but I'm still on the Old fashioned, traditional conserving side of things. I like so when I talk about landscape, I'm talking about protecting and conserving what I love in the Cumbrian landscape. I'm and And this is why I disagree with people like Michael Gove. Michael Gove's yeah. He's in the conservative party, but he's a radical.\n\nMhmm. He's a radical, whiggish liberal. He's a yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Chris Colpin, Rory less landscape is one of the reasons he's a Tory. I don't understand this. I love and understand the Marlborough's British landscape, but It doesn't come near to making a Tory, rather the reverse because restrictive land ownership and capitalist farming have done so much damage to our landscapes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's again where where I probably disagree. So the Cumbrian landscape that I love\n\nSpeaker 0: What about land ownership, though? Come on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's part part part part part land ownership. I I love, Actually, the patchwork of family owned farms right away across Cumbria. I love the combination of sheep pasture with wilderness, And I'm very, very suspicious, and I've gotten lots of trouble with this. In fact, someone's just written a book, who was the RSPB attacking me for this, with the rewilding movement, both on the right and on the left, And their attempt to transform the landscape into something it hasn't looked like for 2 a half 1000 years. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: 1 of 1 of I remember my cousin giving me a a book Who owns Scotland? A few years ago. I don't know if you read it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I I've I've got got a copy of it.\n\nSpeaker 0: I bet you. It's all in it.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's all my neighbors. It's all my neighbors. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, it's just like it's a very, very, very small number of very, very, very, very wealthy people. Last 1.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Last 1. Part of the problem this is George Clare. Part of the problem in British politics is that the prime minister and principal secretaries of state must balance their work as government ministers ticket. With their workers' MPs representing a geographical constituency.\n\nIf we were to transition to party list system, the PM could focus on the departments and delegate the parliamentary responsibilities matters to the next candidate duly elected on the list. System already operates in successful democracies such as Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Would this work for the UK?\n\nSpeaker 0: Similar question, Oles, been watching TV show Borgen recently, Danish political drama. Do you think UK would benefit from a multiparty system which no one party can hold absolute power? Similar area. I'd I'd well, I don't buy the idea that just because you're a minister, you can't be an MP. I mean, yes, it adds to the workload, But at the same time, I think it's a really, really important point of connection.\n\nAnd you have to be good at delegating and good at building systems and making sure you got people keeping everything tracked for you. So I guess deep down, that's a question from somebody who wants to change the electoral system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think it's also deep down from something that I felt with my switches. They couldn't understand how you could have a full time job as a constituency MP and then suddenly become a cabinet minister working full time on running the health service. How could you have 2 full time jobs? And the answer had to be that 1 or the other was gonna have to suffer. You can't do everything.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I think we should close with this one. John Thompson. Now we can give very this is a really complicated question, but I think we should give a 1 sentence answer to it. You can only choose 1 of the following. Which is it and why?\n\nBurnley gained promotion until 2030, which means they win the triple. Global extreme poverty eradicated. Carbon emissions at net zero or slightly negative, global female education levels the same as male, all populist charlatans are brought to justice.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd go for Burnley.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're lying. You're lying. Okay. Let's leave it at that then.",
