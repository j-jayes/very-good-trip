Welcome to another episode of The Restless Politics Question Time with me, Alastair Campbell. And with me, Rory Stewart. Now, Rory, we talked in the main podcast about, the earthquake in Turkey, but very good question here from Fred Banning. Reports this week suggest that Turkey has raised £30,000,000,000 in earthquake tax since 1999. That's the the earthquake that I mentioned in the main podcast. But it's unclear where the money has gone. How can those donating to the disaster emergencies committee appeal and other organizations do so with confidence that the money will get to where it's needed. And I guess that's something you have to wrestle with as a charity head the whole time. Yeah. So we're actually involved in a very small way in the response to Turkey and Syria because one of the things that you need to provide, and it's Something Gift directly provides is is cash support to people when families are wiped out because it allows them to meet their immediate needs. Sometimes you get a problem, which is that you guess that what everyone in a Town needs its tents and actually they've got shelter and what they need is food, so Cash allows you to adapt that. The answer is the Disaster Emergency Committee and their appeal Goes through NGOs that I admire immensely, NGOs like Save the Children that I've praised a lot on this on the show, others like Oxfam, who I've got a lot of admiration for, and They absolutely are getting this money directly out on the ground. It's not being handed over to the Turkish government, and the same is true with our operations through Give Directly. We, As the name implies, we take cash from the public. We put it straight into the hands of the recipients on the ground. We're not putting it through the Turkish government. Mhmm. Okay. Big Kenny. I don't know if that is King Kenny Dalglish. I'm I'm sure I know his daughter is a listener, but I don't know about Kenny himself. Kelly will have to tell us, are the Tories trying to leave the country in such a bad state because they know Labour are going to win the next election? That way they can blame them for everything, and try to cut it to 1 turn in opposition. I don't see that's as crazy as it sounds. Go on then. Give us give us your theory on that. No. I don't know. Look. Some days, I think I do think everything this government is touching seems they seem to be making things worse. Is there Some kind of is there some weird plan going on here? But it's interesting. We had another we had another Tory MP yesterday throwing in the towel Glenn Stevenage? Yep. 21 now, I think it is. And I think it's part of the general I mean, I think it's very miserable being a conservative MP. I saw a minister recently He's been a minister for a long time now, and I said, how are things? And he said, how do you think things are? I'm just miserable. He was even more miserable when Boris Johnson was in, but It's just horrible, really, and I can see why many many of them are leaving. I don't think they're trying to, screw the country up, But I do remember it's something that political parties often say, the the myth in the conservative party, which they're not gonna be able to keep going now because they've wrecked it, But always used to be that they inherited financial problems from Labour and then they sorted them out, but that fundamental story that we campaigned with on 2010th seems to now be in a bit trouble. I I think I think Labour genuinely will be able to run the mess we inherited, the mess we inherited, the mess we inherited. Yeah. I also think, by the way, it opens the door for Labour to be much bolder. I'm even beginning to wonder we get quite a lot of questions about electoral reform. I'm even beginning to wonder whether You couldn't actually wipe the Tories out for good by saying, listen. We we'll think about changing the electoral system next time as well. I think you could have a huge impact because on the current polls, You'd end up with Labour getting almost half the seats and Tories only quarter the seats. I I agree with you also that you you keep sending out this Tweets say, you I can't believe it. 20% of the British population is still validatory. I'm glad you've noticed. I'm glad you've noticed. But one of the but but that, of course, connects to your Point about what we were discussing with Alan Milburn on leading around the MINGVAS strategy, that when you've got that kind of lead, I do think you can be a bit bolder. Now I say that Bearing in mind that many of us said that to Theresa May when she seemed to have a commanding lead over Jeremy Corbyn 7 weeks before an election, encouraged her to bring in these very radical texts to fund social care, the tax on homes, and she managed to lose her majority from this Amazing commanding majority. So, you know, maybe I'm contradicting myself. Yeah. Gone. Your comments will be welcome. This is from m Taylor. On Richard Sharp's position after the Sunday Times front page this weekend. We talked on the main podcast about The lack of shame in relation to Lee Anderson being found out of sort of and it was trivial on one level, stitching up a sort of a guy to say he was wonderful. But I watched Richard Sharp through that select committee appearance, and I mean, I know not liking the cut of somebody's jib is not enough to say that they should go. But what I find scandalous about this is that he can't see that there was anything wrong with what he did, But while he was trying to become chairman of the BBC, he was helping the prime minister, who would be ultimately the person to decide whether he got the job or not, to get an 800,000 pound loan from somebody who, at the same time, it seems, is also trying to become the head of a I I think it was the British Council. And even weirder, the cabinet so cozy. And the cabinet secretary appears to have decided that Boris Johnson didn't need to declare this loan Because the man was a a relative, a second cousin. But then it turns out that he'd never met this 2nd cousin, that he required Richard Sharp to introduce him to a second cousin, Which really calls into question the cabinet secretary's judgment. I mean, how could he somehow think that it was okay for Boris Johnson to take an £800,000 loan from somebody he'd never met Simply because he happened to be his 2nd cousin. I mean, I've yet to hear anybody tell me anything about the way Simon Case has conducted himself as cabinet secretary that tells me he's They're doing the job that the cabinet secretary should be doing, which is, 1, speaking up for civil servants. I don't get the feeling he does that too much. But also part of your job in that position is to speak truth to power, and part of speaking truth to power is to tell them the limits of the power that they have. And that was one absolute red line. I can't believe it. Look. It wouldn't even have required the cabinet secretary. I can't think of Anybody that I worked with in Downing Street who would not have said, I'm sorry, you can't do this. It's it's also that I mean, Simon was brought in very, very, very young. I mean, it's it's a strange decision to have brought somebody in in that way. Cabinet secretaries, we should talk about them a bit more on the on the show, but, You know, these people- I'm a real admirer of a man called Richard Wilson who maybe you came across, but Robin Butler before him, Robert Armstrong before him, I mean these were sort of- They came in at much, I think, they were much older when they came in. They had incredible seniority within the Burke Trend, another very famous one, wasn't he, Had such sort of gravitas and such an ability to sort of represent the traditions of the civil service in its best way to the prime minister, and I think Simon Case wasn't really set up to do that when Boris Johnson brought him in. Well, we could definitely talk about all of those because they they were, Not all of them. Not Bertrand, but, several of those you mentioned were cabinet secretaries during during our time, but that's probably a much longer Discussion. But what about this one, Rory? James Thomas. Where between Alexander Boris de Pfeiffel Johnson and Nadim Zahawi On the Rory Stewart distinguished scale, does Lee Anderson sit? So So I'm I'm gonna draw the scale for you. I think we'd say that on your distinguished scale, Johnson is so far off it Yep. That you know, he's right. He's he's right over there. Nadim Zahawi, I think you started with him over here, but I think you brought him into about here. I've now got my hand in the middle of the scale. Yeah. So where are you putting Lee Anderson? It's it's not not very distinguished. Not not my Not my type of conservative. Although it's an interesting I mean, it's a stupid comment because it responds to slightly what we were talking about yesterday, but those 3 figures do show The way the conservative party's changing and its diversity in terms of people's backgrounds, I mean, nobody could be more different In their background and education than Lee Anderson and Boris Johnson, and yet they ended up on exactly the same side on on Brexit. Yeah. And Lee and Lee Lee Anderson is on record as saying that he's he sees Boris Johnson as as part of his family. Now here we are. Berlin elections, Joe Heger. Given Alastair's interest in Germany, be great to hear your thoughts on the Berlin election results. How much this is due to citizens' dissatisfaction with the way the city's governed Versus a more general swing towards the right in Europe. Could you just begin by telling us what happened in the Berlin election? Well, Berlin is one of the 3 cities in Germany that is also a land, one of the one of the 16 lender. Uh-huh. I think the other 2 are Bremen and is it Hamburg? So they had on this weekend just gone, they had the election there, and it was pretty catastrophic for the SPD, the the the social democrats. Berlin has been a social democrat place for as long as I can remember, And it was governed up until now, and this is we'll get onto this. This is the crazy thing about their system, by what's called a red green red coalition. The the SPD, The Greens and the Left party delinker. And and and, also, just to interrupt for a second, so broadly speaking, you're saying that Berlin Was left wing in the way that London, by and large, has become a left wing city. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and it's always been seen as a as an SPD Stronghold. But because of their system, not necessarily with sort of massive numbers in terms of the share of the vote. But what happened at the weekend is The CDU, the the right wing party, Angela Merkel's party, went from 18% to 28.2%. The SPD fell from 21 to just over 18. The Greens fell slightly. The Linker fell slightly. So the CDU are, without doubt, the clear out and out winner. But in the discussions that are now taking place, the SPD is still trying to see whether They can't put together the same coalition, and they I think it's leading to a lot of soul searching. And, of course, it's not a good result. Obviously, this is not just about national government, and I hate it when people have local and regional elections, and and they just sort of, you know, say what this means nationally. But I think it is a bit of a blow both for Schultz And also for the free Democrats who are part of the government, they they fell pretty badly as well from 7% to 4 4.6. So yet again, we're seeing that Governing parties struggle. And I think the the other thing that was there was a lot of, didn't really get much coverage this outside of Germany, But there was a lot of, disorder around, New Year. A lot of it blamed upon the immigrant population and, The feeling that, you know, the authorities just haven't got on top of this. So it's whichever way you look at it, and I speak as somebody who obviously is a supporter of the SPD in Germany, whichever way you look at it, it is not a good result for them. Okay. Right. So I think I had a question for you as as our sports expert, Joseph Salter on the Paris Olympics. My question to you in 2 parts, what justification is there for the Russian Federation being allowed to compete at the Paris Olympics? Secondly, what can be done to overturn this position? Well, I don't think there's any justification for the Russian Federation taking part. The question that I think is is being discussed is whether there should be any place for any of the Russian and Belarusian athletes under a neutral flag. And this has become a real pot potato. In fact, I know you've been in Switzerland, and I've just been in Switzerland, and I was talking to somebody who works at the International Olympic Commission, the IOC, and their position, the position of Thomas Bach, who's the head of it, is that There should be a place for athletes, but not they they they will not get medals, as it were, that go on the medal table for their country. They would not wear the national flags. They would not have the national anthem sung if they were to win a gold medal, but Zelensky is very much against that. I I see the British sports minister took part in a conference call the other day with a lot of Europeans who said that they didn't think there should be any place. And I think it's a tricky one because if you go back through the history, at the moment, you know, every knows there's wars going on. There are lots of wars going on at the time of Olympics. We're back to the discussion we're with Michael Johnson about other issues, about, you know, 2 different people can be right in different ways at the same time. So I I think it's it's it's not as black and white as saying they are from Russia, therefore, they should have no right to compete. You know, how would people feel, for example, if a Russian or Belarusian athlete took part and then defected and then made a great statement against Putin and against Lukashenko? So I think it's one of those that's gonna resolve itself over time. I think Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, I think she's come out very strongly against, but I think this one's yet to be resolved. Very good. Now here's here's one teasing you. Oh, dear. So this is on the pronunciation of the Chinese premier from Andrew College. I I get this a lot. Please would former diplomat Rory give accomplished linguist, Alastair, some coaching on the pronunciation Of the Xi in Xi Jinping. Anywhere between c and she is fine, but definitely no z. Yeah. Now the I've I've I've had this is not the 1st time I've heard this. I why do I say Xi Jinping? I guess it's because in its part part no. It's partly, this is because of the way in which Chinese has turned into British, so there used to be something called the Wei Jiles system. When I was taught Chinese, we were taught in the Wei Jiles system where his family name, which is the first bit of it, Was spelt h s I, which encouraged me to think it was pronounced c, but then they've changed it to x I and I think the struggle for English speakers is to work out how you pronounce that x because it's not obvious why you wouldn't write s h to try to try to remember it. And then the final thing, of course, which which, you know, where we all go wrong and I'm horrible at, is getting the tones right because it's in fact a rising tone, a falling tone, and a rising tone. So it's something like, Xi Jinping? And I I I'm now gonna be criticized by everybody. So so I do tend to say Xi Jinping, But I shouldn't say, I should say. Oh, Francois Hollande told me that. He told me I mispronounced it. He said it's a z. He's he's c. Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping. Yep. So it goes up, down, up. So Okay. Yeah. Anyway Okay. Well, you you'll be better at it. You're a better musician, better linguist than me. Yeah. Gone then. Question for you to me. Flame, where do you see yourselves in 10 years? If you could pick any job, political and other, What would you do to best influence the world for good? And, Rory, will you be returning to active politics? I hope you can both use your wonderful positions to make a real difference. And we talked about this a little bit with, Decca Aikenhead, who I thought made a very fair point. She said it's all very well for you guys, you know, Getting lots of people listening to your podcast, but surely, if you really want to make a difference, you should get back in. And I should give a shout out to Douglas Alexander, one of your Predecessors as secretary of state for international development, he's just been selected for Labour in East Lothian, lost his seat in Paisley Good on him. And has come back. And I think I do think good on him because I think good on him. Yeah. Yeah. That's really good on him. So what about you? Do you think you, do you think you will ever Well, I don't know. I mean, I'm very I I am very, very lucky at the moment because I'm involved in this charity that I love, and and I do come across colleagues who've left politics Or even people who've sold businesses casting around to work out what's achieved with their life, and I've got an amazing team. We're running 12 country offices. I think we're making a real difference to extreme poverty, And I think I can help in a small way, lead a drive to convince people that the way to address extreme poverty is through cash, And that that's the key to international travel. But I can feel a but coming. I can feel a but. Yeah. And the but, I suppose, is this, that that as I Relax more as I recover more. I'm a kind of recovering politician. The temptation comes back more. Mhmm. And and If I could find I mean, it's so difficult, isn't it? I mean, the the fantasy is to find a way to be helpful and really help the country, but Boy oh, boy. Douglas Alexander putting himself through that. Is is it a seat he's likely to win? Is it All of these seats at one point you'd have felt were were laborers. East Lothian, I think it is a winnable seat. And I could be completely wrong here. I think I'm right that the sitting SMP MP is a guy called Kenny MacAskill, who was one of the few who defected to Alex Salmons' outfit. Fit, so whether there's something not very healthy going on within the s pen SMP there. But Douglas is somebody whom I've got a lot of time on. He's obviously you know, I've worked with him on several election campaigns. He's smart. He was a good minister. I think it's good that somebody and, you know, and I gotta say, if if I were If I were Keir Starmer, you I know you were raving about Alan Millburn the other day. I would be thinking about I wonder if there are people out there of the, you know, the the younger ones of the older generation, as it were, that it might be worth thinking of trying to get them persuade them to come back. So I I think it's good because I think it I think Decca had a point. I think we both feel we can make a a contribution in a different way. I think the podcast is a good way of sort of staying engaged in the debate. But, you know, one of the reasons I've written this book is, ultimately, it's about encouraging, in my case, particularly younger people, to say, I wanna get engaged in politics. I want to know how to do it. I want to give it a go because if if not, we just leave it to the bad guys. That's it. That's it. Alright. Let's take a quick break there, Rory. We'll be back in a minute. Now where is the north south divide? Farmer's friend. Where do you think the north of England starts? Daughters' friends think spalding. Grayson Perry seems to be about Sheffield on its TV show, Which is the Midlands in Farmers Friends' view. And Farmers Friends reckons the north starts at a line just above Scott's corner on the a one. Yeah. You see, Stephen Munro, who works on the Coron Ferry, every time we talk about the North when we're talking about England, he sends me a message saying, We're the north. He's up in the Highlands. Okay? Look, Sheffield's definitely in the north. I can't Sheffield's not in the south. How can you say Sheffield's in the south? Well, Lewis, I mean, It's interesting, mate. As a come in MP, I always felt a bit weird about people talking about, you know, Manchester or Sheffield being the north because they were a hell of a long way south from me. Yeah. But if you if you live in London or or I mean, people say, well, north of Watford. If you live in Watford, you think of Sheffield. I mean, Sheffield is the north. It's like, How can anybody dispute that? I don't understand that anybody can dispute that Sheffield is is in the north. Actually, Rory, here's one that fits with what you've just been talking about. Rob Young, how do MPs manage to do their duties as affected when their constituencies are in remote areas? I've always had a lot of respect for Alastair Carmichael, who's been serving as the Lib Dem MP for Shetland and Orkney since 2001. And I I I like Alastair Carmichael as well. I think he's a very good guy. But you had a pretty rural constituency here. Yes, I had the largest, largest constituency in England. It would take me a couple of hours to drive from one end to the other, and often I was doing surgeries different ends of the constituency and it was nearly, I guess, a 5 hour drive or many days to get up from London, and it's a difficult balancing act Because particularly if you've got a working partner, they've got to decide whether they're gonna be working in the constituency or working in London and whichever they decide, You're only gonna be able to see them about 4 days a week. And the other 3 days, you won't see them whichever way you choose to do it. I remember once being in Australia with this guy who was a a member of the Australian parliament, And, part of his expenses package was that he had a helicopter, and the reason he's had a helicopter is that his constituency was was bigger than Portugal. Amazing. Well, it's it's it it is amazing, and I've noticed Rishi Sunak's been getting in trouble hopping around helicopters. Oh, I think I think that's fair. I think I do think the other day, Or was it you went down to the Westcountry, then it got flown back, and then you got a helicopter back to call the next day? I mean, you've gotta think about the optics as well as the fuel that you're burning. Well, I don't know. I mean, I it's it's an interesting one. I I I obviously, I think it'd be outrageous for me to have a helicopter, but it is true that I felt, there was a big difference between MPs like me representing constituencies up on the Scottish border and people like, You know, Malcolm Rifkind who was representing Chelsea in Westminster where he could just his constituents weren't there for the weekend and he could just toddle out of the House of Commons straight over. It's a very different world and we talked a lot about Lee Anderson on on the last couple of shows. There's a reason why increasingly the new breed of politician, new Generation politicians are very much local people who've grown up, spent their whole life in local constituencies because there is a big divide between The culture of London and and the culture of elsewhere. And I think the days of people like me and, dare I say, Tony Blair slightly parachuting into Interseats in the North may be coming to an end. Well, let's see. Let's see, Roy. You're getting a little bit there's lots of gaps opening up in the Tory ranks. That's for sure. Steven Clark, what did you make of last week's State of the Union address by president Biden? I missed it. Missed it. So You can't present a podcast called The Rest is Politics And not at least have a sense of the president of America's state of the union Gone. And tell us about what you thought of it. I 2 things. 1, I thought he was on really good form and hit a lot of good buttons, Stayed off a lot of the so called woke stuff, did a lot of the foreign policy stuff. I guess the the speech was got a lot of the coverage, though, was from the heckling by some of these republicans. And that woman, Marjorie, whatever name is, something Clark, I saw yesterday coverage of her doing a rally in down in wherever she's from, where she got the crowd going by saying, hands up if you think Mitch McConnell really is a Republican. No no hands were raised. Hands up if you think Mitch McConnell is actually a democrat. Yeah. Oh, hands up. And then somebody said, he's not a democrat. He's a communist. And I thought, my god. What is happening to this country? Mitch McConnell is so right wing in my scale. Right? And here we have a Republican congresswoman whipping up her crowd against not against Joe Biden, he's just, you know, evil, but against Mitch McConnell. I I mean, that place is becoming ungovernable. Well, it is it's interesting, isn't it? I I always think about this. When I was in the States and people focused a lot on Joe Manchin who's the ticket. The Democrat senator from West Virginia who had the swing votes on a lot of the legislation in the 1st couple of years of Biden's administration. And everyone was completely horrified by the fact that he had much more right wing views than many other Democrats. But, of course, on the other hand, he would never have won that seat if If he hadn't had more right wing views, it wasn't a natural Democrat seat, it was a Republican seat. And he held onto that seat for the Democrats and won the Democrats that majority in the Senate, Partly through those views that that people then complained about. Yeah. But he also if if I can give a bit of breaking news Go on then. To our listeners. Well, we've done we've got David Laminex for leading. Then we've got Fiona Hill, foreign policy adviser to Trump and others, but we've also got Bernie Sanders coming up. Bernie Sanders. And as a result of that, I'm reading his new book, It's Okay to be Angry About Capitalism, and Manchin features quite a lot as he calls him a corporate democrat, one of the corporate democrats. But what comes through in reading Bernie's book is just how difficult American politics is because of the grip of money on politics. And I think we've really, really gotta be Very, very careful about the way our money's going. I didn't see it, but I saw all the social media traffic on this channel for a documentary about Russian money in the Conservative Party. I think that Labour I think Sunak should do this as well, but he he won't because I think he's too deep in. But I really hope Labour do come in with a with a new approach on funding. And I know it's difficult. They've all gotta get funding. They've all gotta get money raised. But Oh, I I'd love to do it. I'd love to do it. And, luckily, we don't have I mean, the thing that gets in the way in the states is this ridiculous abuse of the constitution and Supreme Court rulings which allow these super PACs. Yeah. No. Well, Bernie taught us a lot about that. Hopefully, they're sending you the book before we do it as well, but the It's really worth reading. You feel like you're you're listening to a never ending Bernie Sanders speech. You really sort of he's on it the whole time, but he got the guys got energy. I'd give him that. So in Britain, it was lovely, to be honest, running as a local MP in Penrith on the border, and realising that the total campaign spending limit For the short campaign was I think £17,000. And I think that's you know, I keep saying this to American colleagues, that's the way to do it. And my Labour and Lib Dem colleagues watched every penny we spent. If our team were wearing T shirts, they'd get the cost of T shirts, they'd get the cost of every banner To make sure we weren't spending over £17,000. And it does mean that basically in those local constituency elections, There isn't really huge scope for corruption in Britain because you can't actually buy someone for that money because, actually, your local association is able to raise most of that money itself. To finish, though, I mean, I'd really like to challenge the conservatives have got to state stop taking money from big business, and Labour have got to stop taking money from the unions. It's not necessary. There is no reason why these parties need to bring in these 1,000,000 of pounds. Oh, you sure about that? I mean, you've gotta have an organization. You gotta have structures. I look. I agree it's become corrupted, but listen. I run a few election campaigns, and I wouldn't have liked on it without a few few bold and no. Yeah. Danger Dins, would here this is a straight yes or no question, Rory. Yeah. Would Rory be a Democrat in the United States? Yes. Good. Tom Halloran, thanks to Rory, Alastair played a blinder against Rees Mogg on the Radio four Brexit panel. Totally disarm him. Do you both agree? I I did use your tactic, Rory. You said that I should sort of, you know, expose what he was doing, and I did do a bit app. But, actually, I think he lost the debate because he he just wasn't on form. He was he was sort of a bit all over the place. He was very subdued. He started gaslighting straight away. Once people started booing him, It was, it was pretty much game over. Listen. Here's a question for you. I think I think we'll disagree agreeably on this one. Daniel Viren. Yep. I'm a 1st year economics and politics student at University of Bristol. Do you believe that compulsory voting should be implemented in the UK? It has successfully increased vote turnout in Australia and Belgium to 92 and 90% respectively. I am a yes. I I'm a yes too. How are we? We're agreeing. I mean, yes, too. A lot of our listeners hate it when I say that, actually. I've been abused particularly by cumbering constituents. Before we close, I did have somebody ask me a Valentine's Day question, which I thought was definitely something we have to cover. So Steve Smith heading to Cumbria for an evening this Valentine's. Rory, any recommendations on So big recommendation at the moment, if you can, get up High Street, which runs and walk the whole route, Which takes you from Ascom right over to Water Millock. So you're basically going from Penrith right the way over the other side of the Lake District. Yeah. Hold on. This is I think the question is about a date, Rory. It's not about a walk. It's about a date. It's about walks? And the Local Eats. Okay. Local Eats. Well, if you if you're really feeling like treating someone, Askham Hall, Absolutely lovely, delicious meal. Very good. It is a good part. And, Rory, we get a lot of people saying they enjoy saying what we're reading and watching, so I've told you what, I'm I'm reading Bernie Sanders' book. I've just I finished Fiona Hill's book on the drive down, listened to it on Audible at double speed, which gave me a bit of car sickness, but it's a very good read. And I'm also reading John Lennon. I didn't even know that this it's one of those books that's just been sitting on a bookshelf for years, And it's it's his musings, John Lennon in his own right, w r I t e. And it's absolutely brilliant. I mean, the guy was a genius, comic genius. Very good. Well, here here are a couple for me. So I talked a little bit last time about this amazing book that I was reading called Lost Realms, Histories of Britain from the Romans to the Vikings, just a beautiful, beautiful book because it takes all the micro kingdoms that emerged between the end of the Roman Empire In Britain. So places that were smaller, Elmont, for example, in Yorkshire, not very far from you, actually, where you grew up in Keastly, had a bit of Elmont going on, But tiny, tiny places with their own kings, their own literature, their own culture. And the author takes you All the way around from Wales up to Scotland in these micro kingdoms, and does it so beautifully because archaeology is changing So much in the last few years the way that we view the so called dark ages. Brilliant. And he's just brilliant at bringing them tonight. Another thing which I've talked about a little bit, which I I think you'd really like if you haven't read them, Philip Kerr has written a series of, Before He Guide, Three detective stories where the hero is a football manager. Oh. So I don't know whether you whether you read detective stories, but it's really fun. Really fun. Well, I've written I've written a novel where the hero is a football manager, Saturday Bloody Saturday. Well, I need to read your Saturday buddy Saturday. I don't well, you might enjoy. It's about it's about Football and terrorism. It's about the IRA. Okay. But it's also about the hero is an, an alcoholic football manager. Yep. Very good. So I'm watching this very funny Steve Martin thing, Only Murders in the Building. Oh, lord. What's that then? Well, it's it's it's sort of it's comic, but it's got a serious thing. But it's also it's actually It's about people who are making a true crime podcast inside their own building where they live, where there's been a murder. So it's it's quite funny. There's a lot of podcast dynamic going on within it, which is quite amusing. Well, I've been watching House of the Dragon, which is the the prequel to Game of Thrones- Right. Where Paddy Constantine plays a really Wonderful King, sort of strangely weak, sympathetic, compassionate, puzzled And and I think for anyone interested in power, it it gets it gets better, and it's it doesn't have the kind of the sort of gratuitous violence and soft Porn elements, which I think slightly wrecked Game of Thrones for me. Yeah. I I I I can't watch violence on television. Yeah. Hate to So There there I am. House of Dragon. I've been enjoying it. Okay. Are we about done? I I think we are. And I honestly, you and I should go off and get our Lemn Sip. Yeah. Is yours just a cold, or is it post hyper is it a post hypothermic cold, which is obviously a lot more glamorous? I don't have any hypothermia, but it's absolutely horrible. Did you ever watch, a British comedy show called Citizen Khan where the hero coughs and splutters and bursts from the recording? Yeah. Yeah. Is that you? Yeah. That's Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, have a lovely evening. Bye bye. See you. Bye.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nWelcome to another episode of The Restless Politics Question Time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now, Rory, we talked in the main podcast about, the earthquake in Turkey, but very good question here from Fred Banning. Reports this week suggest that Turkey has raised £30,000,000,000 in earthquake tax since 1999. That's the the earthquake that I mentioned in the main podcast. But it's unclear where the money has gone. How can those donating to the disaster emergencies committee appeal and other organizations do so with confidence that the money will get to where it's needed.\n\nAnd I guess that's something you have to wrestle with as a charity head the whole time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So we're actually involved in a very small way in the response to Turkey and Syria because one of the things that you need to provide, and it's Something Gift directly provides is is cash support to people when families are wiped out because it allows them to meet their immediate needs. Sometimes you get a problem, which is that you guess that what everyone in a Town needs its tents and actually they've got shelter and what they need is food, so Cash allows you to adapt that. The answer is the Disaster Emergency Committee and their appeal Goes through NGOs that I admire immensely, NGOs like Save the Children that I've praised a lot on this on the show, others like Oxfam, who I've got a lot of admiration for, and They absolutely are getting this money directly out on the ground. It's not being handed over to the Turkish government, and the same is true with our operations through Give Directly.\n\nWe, As the name implies, we take cash from the public. We put it straight into the hands of the recipients on the ground. We're not putting it through the Turkish government.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Okay. Big Kenny. I don't know if that is King Kenny Dalglish. I'm I'm sure I know his daughter is a listener, but I don't know about Kenny himself.\n\nKelly will have to tell us, are the Tories trying to leave the country in such a bad state because they know Labour are going to win the next election? That way they can blame them for everything, and try to cut it to 1 turn in opposition. I don't see that's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go on then. Give us give us your theory on that.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I don't know. Look. Some days, I think I do think everything this government is touching seems they seem to be making things worse. Is there Some kind of is there some weird plan going on here?\n\nBut it's interesting. We had another we had another Tory MP yesterday throwing in the towel Glenn Stevenage? Yep. 21 now, I think it is.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I think it's part of the general I mean, I think it's very miserable being a conservative MP. I saw a minister recently He's been a minister for a long time now, and I said, how are things? And he said, how do you think things are? I'm just miserable. He was even more miserable when Boris Johnson was in, but It's just horrible, really, and I can see why many many of them are leaving.\n\nI don't think they're trying to, screw the country up, But I do remember it's something that political parties often say, the the myth in the conservative party, which they're not gonna be able to keep going now because they've wrecked it, But always used to be that they inherited financial problems from Labour and then they sorted them out, but that fundamental story that we campaigned with on 2010th seems to now be in a bit trouble.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I think I think Labour genuinely will be able to run the mess we inherited, the mess we inherited, the mess we inherited. Yeah. I also think, by the way, it opens the door for Labour to be much bolder. I'm even beginning to wonder we get quite a lot of questions about electoral reform. I'm even beginning to wonder whether You couldn't actually wipe the Tories out for good by saying, listen.\n\nWe we'll think about changing the electoral system next time as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you could have a huge impact because on the current polls, You'd end up with Labour getting almost half the seats and Tories only quarter the seats. I I agree with you also that you you keep sending out this Tweets say, you I can't believe it. 20% of the British population is still validatory.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm glad you've noticed. I'm glad you've noticed.\n\nSpeaker 1: But one of the but but that, of course, connects to your Point about what we were discussing with Alan Milburn on leading around the MINGVAS strategy, that when you've got that kind of lead, I do think you can be a bit bolder. Now I say that Bearing in mind that many of us said that to Theresa May when she seemed to have a commanding lead over Jeremy Corbyn 7 weeks before an election, encouraged her to bring in these very radical texts to fund social care, the tax on homes, and she managed to lose her majority from this Amazing commanding majority. So, you know, maybe I'm contradicting myself.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gone. Your comments will be welcome. This is from m Taylor. On Richard Sharp's position after the Sunday Times front page this weekend.\n\nSpeaker 0: We talked on the main podcast about The lack of shame in relation to Lee Anderson being found out of sort of and it was trivial on one level, stitching up a sort of a guy to say he was wonderful. But I watched Richard Sharp through that select committee appearance, and I mean, I know not liking the cut of somebody's jib is not enough to say that they should go. But what I find scandalous about this is that he can't see that there was anything wrong with what he did, But while he was trying to become chairman of the BBC, he was helping the prime minister, who would be ultimately the person to decide whether he got the job or not, to get an 800,000 pound loan from somebody who, at the same time, it seems, is also trying to become the head of a I I think it was the British Council.\n\nSpeaker 1: And even weirder, the cabinet so cozy. And the cabinet secretary appears to have decided that Boris Johnson didn't need to declare this loan Because the man was a a relative, a second cousin. But then it turns out that he'd never met this 2nd cousin, that he required Richard Sharp to introduce him to a second cousin, Which really calls into question the cabinet secretary's judgment. I mean, how could he somehow think that it was okay for Boris Johnson to take an £800,000 loan from somebody he'd never met Simply because he happened to be his 2nd cousin.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, I've yet to hear anybody tell me anything about the way Simon Case has conducted himself as cabinet secretary that tells me he's They're doing the job that the cabinet secretary should be doing, which is, 1, speaking up for civil servants. I don't get the feeling he does that too much. But also part of your job in that position is to speak truth to power, and part of speaking truth to power is to tell them the limits of the power that they have. And that was one absolute red line. I can't believe it.\n\nLook. It wouldn't even have required the cabinet secretary. I can't think of Anybody that I worked with in Downing Street who would not have said, I'm sorry, you can't do this.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's also that I mean, Simon was brought in very, very, very young. I mean, it's it's a strange decision to have brought somebody in in that way. Cabinet secretaries, we should talk about them a bit more on the on the show, but, You know, these people- I'm a real admirer of a man called Richard Wilson who maybe you came across, but Robin Butler before him, Robert Armstrong before him, I mean these were sort of- They came in at much, I think, they were much older when they came in. They had incredible seniority within the Burke Trend, another very famous one, wasn't he, Had such sort of gravitas and such an ability to sort of represent the traditions of the civil service in its best way to the prime minister, and I think Simon Case wasn't really set up to do that when Boris Johnson brought him in.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, we could definitely talk about all of those because they they were, Not all of them. Not Bertrand, but, several of those you mentioned were cabinet secretaries during during our time, but that's probably a much longer Discussion. But what about this one, Rory? James Thomas. Where between Alexander Boris de Pfeiffel Johnson and Nadim Zahawi On the Rory Stewart distinguished scale, does Lee Anderson sit?\n\nSo So I'm I'm gonna draw the scale for you. I think we'd say that on your distinguished scale, Johnson is so far off it Yep. That you know, he's right. He's he's right over there. Nadim Zahawi, I think you started with him over here, but I think you brought him into about here.\n\nI've now got my hand in the middle of the scale.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So where are you putting Lee Anderson?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's not not very distinguished. Not not my Not my type of conservative. Although it's an interesting I mean, it's a stupid comment because it responds to slightly what we were talking about yesterday, but those 3 figures do show The way the conservative party's changing and its diversity in terms of people's backgrounds, I mean, nobody could be more different In their background and education than Lee Anderson and Boris Johnson, and yet they ended up on exactly the same side on on Brexit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And Lee and Lee Lee Anderson is on record as saying that he's he sees Boris Johnson as as part of his family.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now here we are. Berlin elections, Joe Heger. Given Alastair's interest in Germany, be great to hear your thoughts on the Berlin election results. How much this is due to citizens' dissatisfaction with the way the city's governed Versus a more general swing towards the right in Europe. Could you just begin by telling us what happened in the Berlin election?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Berlin is one of the 3 cities in Germany that is also a land, one of the one of the 16 lender. Uh-huh. I think the other 2 are Bremen and is it Hamburg? So they had on this weekend just gone, they had the election there, and it was pretty catastrophic for the SPD, the the the social democrats. Berlin has been a social democrat place for as long as I can remember, And it was governed up until now, and this is we'll get onto this.\n\nThis is the crazy thing about their system, by what's called a red green red coalition. The the SPD, The Greens and the Left party delinker.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and and, also, just to interrupt for a second, so broadly speaking, you're saying that Berlin Was left wing in the way that London, by and large, has become a left wing city. Is that right?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and it's always been seen as a as an SPD Stronghold. But because of their system, not necessarily with sort of massive numbers in terms of the share of the vote.\n\nBut what happened at the weekend is The CDU, the the right wing party, Angela Merkel's party, went from 18% to 28.2%. The SPD fell from 21 to just over 18. The Greens fell slightly. The Linker fell slightly. So the CDU are, without doubt, the clear out and out winner.\n\nBut in the discussions that are now taking place, the SPD is still trying to see whether They can't put together the same coalition, and they I think it's leading to a lot of soul searching. And, of course, it's not a good result. Obviously, this is not just about national government, and I hate it when people have local and regional elections, and and they just sort of, you know, say what this means nationally. But I think it is a bit of a blow both for Schultz And also for the free Democrats who are part of the government, they they fell pretty badly as well from 7% to 4 4.6. So yet again, we're seeing that Governing parties struggle.\n\nAnd I think the the other thing that was there was a lot of, didn't really get much coverage this outside of Germany, But there was a lot of, disorder around, New Year. A lot of it blamed upon the immigrant population and, The feeling that, you know, the authorities just haven't got on top of this. So it's whichever way you look at it, and I speak as somebody who obviously is a supporter of the SPD in Germany, whichever way you look at it, it is not a good result for them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Right. So I think I had a question for you as as our sports expert, Joseph Salter on the Paris Olympics. My question to you in 2 parts, what justification is there for the Russian Federation being allowed to compete at the Paris Olympics? Secondly, what can be done to overturn this position?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I don't think there's any justification for the Russian Federation taking part. The question that I think is is being discussed is whether there should be any place for any of the Russian and Belarusian athletes under a neutral flag. And this has become a real pot potato. In fact, I know you've been in Switzerland, and I've just been in Switzerland, and I was talking to somebody who works at the International Olympic Commission, the IOC, and their position, the position of Thomas Bach, who's the head of it, is that There should be a place for athletes, but not they they they will not get medals, as it were, that go on the medal table for their country. They would not wear the national flags.\n\nThey would not have the national anthem sung if they were to win a gold medal, but Zelensky is very much against that. I I see the British sports minister took part in a conference call the other day with a lot of Europeans who said that they didn't think there should be any place. And I think it's a tricky one because if you go back through the history, at the moment, you know, every knows there's wars going on. There are lots of wars going on at the time of Olympics. We're back to the discussion we're with Michael Johnson about other issues, about, you know, 2 different people can be right in different ways at the same time.\n\nSo I I think it's it's it's not as black and white as saying they are from Russia, therefore, they should have no right to compete. You know, how would people feel, for example, if a Russian or Belarusian athlete took part and then defected and then made a great statement against Putin and against Lukashenko? So I think it's one of those that's gonna resolve itself over time. I think Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, I think she's come out very strongly against, but I think this one's yet to be resolved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Now here's here's one teasing you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, dear.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this is on the pronunciation of the Chinese premier from Andrew College.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I get this a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Please would former diplomat Rory give accomplished linguist, Alastair, some coaching on the pronunciation Of the Xi in Xi Jinping. Anywhere between c and she is fine, but definitely no z. Yeah. Now the I've I've\n\nSpeaker 0: I've had this is not the 1st time I've heard this. I why do I say Xi Jinping? I guess it's because\n\nSpeaker 1: in its part part no. It's partly, this is because of the way in which Chinese has turned into British, so there used to be something called the Wei Jiles system. When I was taught Chinese, we were taught in the Wei Jiles system where his family name, which is the first bit of it, Was spelt h s I, which encouraged me to think it was pronounced c, but then they've changed it to x I and I think the struggle for English speakers is to work out how you pronounce that x because it's not obvious why you wouldn't write s h to try to try to remember it. And then the final thing, of course, which which, you know, where we all go wrong and I'm horrible at, is getting the tones right because it's in fact a rising tone, a falling tone, and a rising tone. So it's something like, Xi Jinping?\n\nAnd I I I'm now gonna be criticized by everybody.\n\nSpeaker 0: So so I do tend to say Xi Jinping, But I shouldn't say, I should say. Oh, Francois Hollande told me that. He told me I mispronounced it. He said it's a z. He's he's c.\n\nXi Jinping. Xi Jinping.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. So it goes up, down, up. So Okay. Yeah. Anyway Okay.\n\nWell, you you'll be better at it. You're a better musician, better linguist than me. Yeah. Gone then. Question for you to me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Flame, where do you see yourselves in 10 years? If you could pick any job, political and other, What would you do to best influence the world for good? And, Rory, will you be returning to active politics? I hope you can both use your wonderful positions to make a real difference. And we talked about this a little bit with, Decca Aikenhead, who I thought made a very fair point.\n\nShe said it's all very well for you guys, you know, Getting lots of people listening to your podcast, but surely, if you really want to make a difference, you should get back in. And I should give a shout out to Douglas Alexander, one of your Predecessors as secretary of state for international development, he's just been selected for Labour in East Lothian, lost his seat in Paisley\n\nSpeaker 1: Good on him.\n\nSpeaker 0: And has come back. And I think I do think good on him because I think good on him. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really good on him.\n\nSpeaker 0: So what about you? Do you think you, do you think you will ever Well, I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I'm very I I am very, very lucky at the moment because I'm involved in this charity that I love, and and I do come across colleagues who've left politics Or even people who've sold businesses casting around to work out what's achieved with their life, and I've got an amazing team. We're running 12 country offices. I think we're making a real difference to extreme poverty, And I think I can help in a small way, lead a drive to convince people that the way to address extreme poverty is through cash, And that that's the key to international travel.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I can feel a but coming. I can feel a but.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And the but, I suppose, is this, that that as I Relax more as I recover more. I'm a kind of recovering politician. The temptation comes back more. Mhmm.\n\nAnd and If I could find I mean, it's so difficult, isn't it? I mean, the the fantasy is to find a way to be helpful and really help the country, but Boy oh, boy. Douglas Alexander putting himself through that. Is is it a seat he's likely to win? Is it\n\nSpeaker 0: All of these seats at one point you'd have felt were were laborers. East Lothian, I think it is a winnable seat. And I could be completely wrong here. I think I'm right that the sitting SMP MP is a guy called Kenny MacAskill, who was one of the few who defected to Alex Salmons' outfit. Fit, so whether there's something not very healthy going on within the s pen SMP there.\n\nBut Douglas is somebody whom I've got a lot of time on. He's obviously you know, I've worked with him on several election campaigns. He's smart. He was a good minister. I think it's good that somebody and, you know, and I gotta say, if if I were If I were Keir Starmer, you I know you were raving about Alan Millburn the other day.\n\nI would be thinking about I wonder if there are people out there of the, you know, the the younger ones of the older generation, as it were, that it might be worth thinking of trying to get them persuade them to come back. So I I think it's good because I think it I think Decca had a point. I think we both feel we can make a a contribution in a different way. I think the podcast is a good way of sort of staying engaged in the debate. But, you know, one of the reasons I've written this book is, ultimately, it's about encouraging, in my case, particularly younger people, to say, I wanna get engaged in politics.\n\nI want to know how to do it. I want to give it a go because if if not, we just leave it to the bad guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it. That's it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Let's take a quick break there, Rory. We'll be back in a minute.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now where is the north south divide? Farmer's friend. Where do you think the north of England starts? Daughters' friends think spalding. Grayson Perry seems to be about Sheffield on its TV show, Which is the Midlands in Farmers Friends' view.\n\nAnd Farmers Friends reckons the north starts at a line just above Scott's corner on the a one.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. You see, Stephen Munro, who works on the Coron Ferry, every time we talk about the North when we're talking about England, he sends me a message saying, We're the north. He's up in the Highlands. Okay? Look, Sheffield's definitely in the north.\n\nI can't Sheffield's not in the south. How can you say Sheffield's in the south?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Lewis, I mean, It's interesting, mate. As a come in MP, I always felt a bit weird about people talking about, you know, Manchester or Sheffield being the north because they were a hell of a long way south from me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But if you if you live in London or or I mean, people say, well, north of Watford. If you live in Watford, you think of Sheffield. I mean, Sheffield is the north. It's like, How can anybody dispute that?\n\nI don't understand that anybody can dispute that Sheffield is is in the north. Actually, Rory, here's one that fits with what you've just been talking about. Rob Young, how do MPs manage to do their duties as affected when their constituencies are in remote areas? I've always had a lot of respect for Alastair Carmichael, who's been serving as the Lib Dem MP for Shetland and Orkney since 2001. And I I I like Alastair Carmichael as well.\n\nI think he's a very good guy. But you had a pretty rural constituency here. Yes, I\n\nSpeaker 1: had the largest, largest constituency in England. It would take me a couple of hours to drive from one end to the other, and often I was doing surgeries different ends of the constituency and it was nearly, I guess, a 5 hour drive or many days to get up from London, and it's a difficult balancing act Because particularly if you've got a working partner, they've got to decide whether they're gonna be working in the constituency or working in London and whichever they decide, You're only gonna be able to see them about 4 days a week. And the other 3 days, you won't see them whichever way you choose to do it.\n\nSpeaker 0: I remember once being in Australia with this guy who was a a member of the Australian parliament, And, part of his expenses package was that he had a helicopter, and the reason he's had a helicopter is that his constituency was was bigger than Portugal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Well, it's it's it it is amazing, and I've noticed Rishi Sunak's been getting in trouble hopping around helicopters. Oh, I\n\nSpeaker 0: think I think that's fair. I think I do think the other day, Or was it you went down to the Westcountry, then it got flown back, and then you got a helicopter back to call the next day? I mean, you've gotta think about the optics as well as the fuel that you're burning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't know. I mean, I it's it's an interesting one. I I I obviously, I think it'd be outrageous for me to have a helicopter, but it is true that I felt, there was a big difference between MPs like me representing constituencies up on the Scottish border and people like, You know, Malcolm Rifkind who was representing Chelsea in Westminster where he could just his constituents weren't there for the weekend and he could just toddle out of the House of Commons straight over. It's a very different world and we talked a lot about Lee Anderson on on the last couple of shows. There's a reason why increasingly the new breed of politician, new Generation politicians are very much local people who've grown up, spent their whole life in local constituencies because there is a big divide between The culture of London and and the culture of elsewhere.\n\nAnd I think the days of people like me and, dare I say, Tony Blair slightly parachuting into Interseats in the North may be coming to an end.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, let's see. Let's see, Roy. You're getting a little bit there's lots of gaps opening up in the Tory ranks. That's for sure. Steven Clark, what did you make of last week's State of the Union address by president Biden?\n\nSpeaker 1: I missed it. Missed it.\n\nSpeaker 0: So You can't present a podcast called The Rest is Politics And not at least have a sense of the president of America's state of the union Gone.\n\nSpeaker 1: And tell us about what you thought of it.\n\nSpeaker 0: I 2 things. 1, I thought he was on really good form and hit a lot of good buttons, Stayed off a lot of the so called woke stuff, did a lot of the foreign policy stuff. I guess the the speech was got a lot of the coverage, though, was from the heckling by some of these republicans. And that woman, Marjorie, whatever name is, something Clark, I saw yesterday coverage of her doing a rally in down in wherever she's from, where she got the crowd going by saying, hands up if you think Mitch McConnell really is a Republican. No no hands were raised.\n\nHands up if you think Mitch McConnell is actually a democrat. Yeah. Oh, hands up. And then somebody said, he's not a democrat. He's a communist.\n\nAnd I thought, my god. What is happening to this country? Mitch McConnell is so right wing in my scale. Right? And here we have a Republican congresswoman whipping up her crowd against not against Joe Biden, he's just, you know, evil, but against Mitch McConnell.\n\nI I mean, that place is becoming ungovernable.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it is it's interesting, isn't it? I I always think about this. When I was in the States and people focused a lot on Joe Manchin who's the ticket. The Democrat senator from West Virginia who had the swing votes on a lot of the legislation in the 1st couple of years of Biden's administration. And everyone was completely horrified by the fact that he had much more right wing views than many other Democrats.\n\nBut, of course, on the other hand, he would never have won that seat if If he hadn't had more right wing views, it wasn't a natural Democrat seat, it was a Republican seat. And he held onto that seat for the Democrats and won the Democrats that majority in the Senate, Partly through those views that that people then complained about.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But he also if if I can give a bit of breaking news\n\nSpeaker 1: Go on then.\n\nSpeaker 0: To our listeners. Well, we've done we've got David Laminex for leading. Then we've got Fiona Hill, foreign policy adviser to Trump and others, but we've also got Bernie Sanders coming up. Bernie Sanders. And as a result of that, I'm reading his new book, It's Okay to be Angry About Capitalism, and Manchin features quite a lot as he calls him a corporate democrat, one of the corporate democrats.\n\nBut what comes through in reading Bernie's book is just how difficult American politics is because of the grip of money on politics. And I think we've really, really gotta be Very, very careful about the way our money's going. I didn't see it, but I saw all the social media traffic on this channel for a documentary about Russian money in the Conservative Party. I think that Labour I think Sunak should do this as well, but he he won't because I think he's too deep in. But I really hope Labour do come in with a with a new approach on funding.\n\nAnd I know it's difficult. They've all gotta get funding. They've all gotta get money raised. But\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I I'd love to do it. I'd love to do it. And, luckily, we don't have I mean, the thing that gets in the way in the states is this ridiculous abuse of the constitution and Supreme Court rulings which allow these super PACs.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No. Well, Bernie taught us a lot about that. Hopefully, they're sending you the book before we do it as well, but the It's really worth reading. You feel like you're you're listening to a never ending Bernie Sanders speech.\n\nYou really sort of he's on it the whole time, but he got the guys got energy. I'd give him that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in Britain, it was lovely, to be honest, running as a local MP in Penrith on the border, and realising that the total campaign spending limit For the short campaign was I think £17,000. And I think that's you know, I keep saying this to American colleagues, that's the way to do it. And my Labour and Lib Dem colleagues watched every penny we spent. If our team were wearing T shirts, they'd get the cost of T shirts, they'd get the cost of every banner To make sure we weren't spending over £17,000. And it does mean that basically in those local constituency elections, There isn't really huge scope for corruption in Britain because you can't actually buy someone for that money because, actually, your local association is able to raise most of that money itself.\n\nTo finish, though, I mean, I'd really like to challenge the conservatives have got to state stop taking money from big business, and Labour have got to stop taking money from the unions. It's not necessary. There is no reason why these parties need to bring in these 1,000,000 of pounds.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, you sure about that? I mean, you've gotta have an organization. You gotta have structures. I look. I agree it's become corrupted, but listen.\n\nI run a few election campaigns, and I wouldn't have liked on it without a few few bold and no. Yeah. Danger Dins, would here this is a straight yes or no question, Rory. Yeah. Would Rory be a Democrat in the United States?\n\nYes. Good. Tom Halloran, thanks to Rory, Alastair played a blinder against Rees Mogg on the Radio four Brexit panel. Totally disarm him. Do you both agree?\n\nI I did use your tactic, Rory. You said that I should sort of, you know, expose what he was doing, and I did do a bit app. But, actually, I think he lost the debate because he he just wasn't on form. He was he was sort of a bit all over the place. He was very subdued.\n\nHe started gaslighting straight away. Once people started booing him, It was, it was pretty much game over. Listen. Here's a question for you. I think I think we'll disagree agreeably on this one.\n\nDaniel Viren. Yep. I'm a 1st year economics and politics student at University of Bristol. Do you believe that compulsory voting should be implemented in the UK? It has successfully increased vote turnout in Australia and Belgium to 92 and 90% respectively.\n\nI am a yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I'm a yes too.\n\nSpeaker 0: How are we? We're agreeing. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: yes, too. A lot of our listeners hate it when I say that, actually. I've been abused particularly by cumbering constituents. Before we close, I did have somebody ask me a Valentine's Day question, which I thought was definitely something we have to cover. So Steve Smith heading to Cumbria for an evening this Valentine's.\n\nRory, any recommendations on So big recommendation at the moment, if you can, get up High Street, which runs and walk the whole route, Which takes you from Ascom right over to Water Millock. So you're basically going from Penrith right the way over the other side of the Lake District. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Hold on. This is I think the question is about a date, Rory. It's not about a walk. It's about a date.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's about walks? And the Local Eats. Okay. Local Eats. Well, if you if you're really feeling like treating someone, Askham Hall, Absolutely lovely, delicious meal.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very good. It is a good part. And, Rory, we get a lot of people saying they enjoy saying what we're reading and watching, so I've told you what, I'm I'm reading Bernie Sanders' book. I've just I finished Fiona Hill's book on the drive down, listened to it on Audible at double speed, which gave me a bit of car sickness, but it's a very good read. And I'm also reading John Lennon.\n\nI didn't even know that this it's one of those books that's just been sitting on a bookshelf for years, And it's it's his musings, John Lennon in his own right, w r I t e. And it's absolutely brilliant. I mean, the guy was a genius, comic genius.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Well, here here are a couple for me. So I talked a little bit last time about this amazing book that I was reading called Lost Realms, Histories of Britain from the Romans to the Vikings, just a beautiful, beautiful book because it takes all the micro kingdoms that emerged between the end of the Roman Empire In Britain. So places that were smaller, Elmont, for example, in Yorkshire, not very far from you, actually, where you grew up in Keastly, had a bit of Elmont going on, But tiny, tiny places with their own kings, their own literature, their own culture. And the author takes you All the way around from Wales up to Scotland in these micro kingdoms, and does it so beautifully because archaeology is changing So much in the last few years the way that we view the so called dark ages.\n\nSpeaker 0: Brilliant.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he's just brilliant at bringing them tonight. Another thing which I've talked about a little bit, which I I think you'd really like if you haven't read them, Philip Kerr has written a series of, Before He Guide, Three detective stories where the hero is a football manager.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I don't know whether you whether you read detective stories, but it's really fun.\n\nSpeaker 0: Really fun. Well, I've written I've written a novel where the hero is a football manager, Saturday Bloody Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I need to read your Saturday buddy Saturday.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't well, you might enjoy. It's about it's about Football and terrorism. It's about the IRA.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: But it's also about the hero is an, an alcoholic football manager. Yep. Very good. So I'm watching this very funny Steve Martin thing, Only Murders in the Building.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, lord. What's that then?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it's it's it's sort of it's comic, but it's got a serious thing. But it's also it's actually It's about people who are making a true crime podcast inside their own building where they live, where there's been a murder. So it's it's quite funny. There's a lot of podcast dynamic going on within it, which is quite amusing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I've been watching House of the Dragon, which is the the prequel to Game of Thrones-\n\nSpeaker 0: Right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Where Paddy Constantine plays a really Wonderful King, sort of strangely weak, sympathetic, compassionate, puzzled And and I think for anyone interested in power, it it gets it gets better, and it's it doesn't have the kind of the sort of gratuitous violence and soft Porn elements, which I think slightly wrecked Game of Thrones for me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I I I I can't watch violence on television.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Hate to So There there I am. House of Dragon. I've been enjoying it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Are we about done?\n\nSpeaker 1: I I think we are. And I honestly, you and I should go off and get our Lemn Sip.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Is yours just a cold, or is it post hyper is it a post hypothermic cold, which is obviously a lot more glamorous?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't have any hypothermia, but it's absolutely horrible. Did you ever watch, a British comedy show called Citizen Khan where the hero coughs and splutters and bursts\n\nSpeaker 0: from the recording? Yeah. Yeah. Is that you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, dear.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, have a lovely evening. Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 0: See you. Bye.",
