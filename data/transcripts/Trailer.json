That's the rest is politics .com. Hello. I'm Alastair Campbell, once Tony Blair's spokesman and now my own. And I'm Rory Stewart, once a conservative cabinet minister and now independent. Join us for a new podcast. The rest is politics. I remember Liz Truss saying to me, I can't imagine why your interest in foreign affairs. It's totally boring for me. I've got no interest in foreign affairs. I'd hate to be foreign secretary. I can't believe that something like Ukraine would have been going on in that period, and the American president Would not have at least had part of his mind thinking, what does Tony Blair think? I just don't believe that Boris Johnson's in that place. The vast majority of MPs think they should be panistling. Whereas in your case, you know that you should, Boris. We'll break down the big news stories home and abroad using our own experience from the heart of the political world. And we'll try to rediscover the lost art of disagreeing agreeably. And what he's saying is that's where my soldiers Bazaram, they're in Russia. He said, do not accept my sovereign right to put the soldiers there. He's not trying to trick her. I don't think he's trying to trick her. I don't know what you thought about that. I think he probably was trying to trick her, to be honest. I think it's a very cunning old cove. You've got I mean, I I felt that most of my colleagues in Parliament, after about 10 years, were no longer human beings. They they've lost basically all the kind of private nuance, And they were completely incapable of listening. Join me, Alastair Campbell. And me, Rory Stewart, for The Rest is politics. Subscribe now. Wherever you get your podcasts. It's funny. We're very different people, different ages. Very different people. Different political tribes, Sitting in different countries, but we're somehow having a conversation. I don't wear a pinky ring. I never will wear a pinky ring. What is the pinky ring thing about? Should I tell you about my pinky ring then? Go",

I've got no interest in foreign affairs. I'd hate to be foreign secretary.\n\nSpeaker 0: I can't believe that something like Ukraine would have been going on in that period, and the American president Would not have at least had part of his mind thinking, what does Tony Blair think? I just don't believe that Boris Johnson's in that place.\n\nSpeaker 1: The vast majority of MPs think they should be panistling.\n\nSpeaker 0: Whereas in your case, you know that you should, Boris. We'll break down the big news stories home and abroad using our own experience from the heart of the political world.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we'll try to rediscover the lost art of disagreeing agreeably. And what he's saying is that's where my soldiers Bazaram, they're in Russia. He said, do not accept my sovereign right to put the soldiers there. He's not trying to trick her. I don't think he's trying to trick her.\n\nI don't know what you thought about that.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think he probably was trying to trick her, to be honest. I think it's a very cunning old cove.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've got I mean, I I felt that most of my colleagues in Parliament, after about 10 years, were no longer human beings. They they've lost basically all the kind of private nuance, And they were completely incapable of listening. Join me, Alastair Campbell. And me, Rory Stewart, for The Rest is politics.

What is the pinky ring thing about?\n\nSpeaker 1: Should I tell you about my pinky ring then?\n\nSpeaker 0: Go",
