Welcome to The Restless Politics. I'm here in London, and Alastair and I are about to interview Yuval Noah Harari. It's a very different type of episode to what we normally do because often we're going for analysts. We're stepping back from situations. In this case, we're talking to a friend of mine within a week of the events that unfolded with Hamas's terrorist attacks across the border from Gaza. He is right in the middle of this, and you will feel in the interview, Joaovel's own personal emotions, his connection to his own family in Israel. I'm not apologizing for that at all. I think if you would like, attempt to get a more objective picture of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, please listen to our last Episode that we put out a few days ago, which tries to look at the bigger history. But I think it's vital in these things to actually hear from people who are fully engaged, who are connected emotionally because only by doing so, I think, do we ever get a sense of how these problems feel, why they're so difficult to resolve. And I think Yuval is a fascinating example of somebody who has been deeply emotionally traumatized, who feels deep attachment to Israel, but is also Finding his way towards talking about peace and empathy, and I think that emotional journey makes this episode even more powerful than some of our other episodes. I hope you enjoyed. Today I mean, it's a very, very difficult, sad day for recording, and my friend Yuval, who we've interviewed a couple of times in the last month, has, Come back to join us after the horrifying terrorist attack of Hamas in in Israel and and now very, very disturbing Ideas around how the Israeli army might respond in Gaza. And Yuval is right in the middle of this. As as people remember who listen to the leading podcasts, he has been a Very outspoken critic of the populism of the Israeli government and particularly their judicial reforms, but he's also found himself caught up as an Israeli and as a family member in the consequences of this attack. So, thank you very much for joining us. Thank you for having me again. Maybe if we can start with Just give giving listeners a sense of of how this attack felt, how it touched on your own family, how it felt personally, How Israelis understand it. Before we go on to to try to talk about our structures, but just the immediate emotional impact. Yeah. I mean, it it goes back to the deepest fears and the darkest moments of Jewish history. At first, people compared it to the Yom Kippur War When the armies of Egypt and Syria surprised Israel, but very quickly the the narrative changed, And everybody's now comparing it, to scenes from the holocaust or from pogroms. The state of Israel for a couple of hours just disappeared. There was no state. The Jewish communities slaughtered. The comparisons are with the mobile killing units of the Nazis That in 1941, 1942 would in places that of today, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, will just Come surround a Jewish village and just either burn people in their houses or just shoot them all to death. And also comparisons with pogroms even earlier, like the famous Kishinev pogrom of 1919 3. And we hear just Stories that we couldn't imagine. Like, we are used to wars, but the idea that there will be massive pogroms in Jews in Israel in 2023, it's just Incomprehensible. I have family in 1 and friends in in several of of these kibbutzim, of these villages that bore the brunt of the attack. My aunt and uncle live in Kibbutz Bary. All contact with them was cut on the morning of the of the attack. We just got news that they somehow survived. They hid in their house as Hamas terrorists just went from house to house in the in the kibbutz And just slaughtered, everybody. And we hear terrible stories about families hiding in in safe rooms, And then the Hamas setting fire to the house to burn them alive or suffocate them in the safe room. And if they try to jump or come out, they just shoot them. I've heard also 1 really I think it encapsulates because these communities, the kibbutzim on the border with Gaza, They were one of the last bastions of the left wing in Israel. People who still clang to the belief in peace Through all those years of of of terrorism and attacks. So one really terrible story I've heard from Faraza, a kibbutz where I have many friends, A family that for couple of years organized this kite festival of flying kites On the fence border with Gaza with messages of peace to show the civilians in Gaza that despite All the violence and, you know, the impossibility of the government of Israel and Hamas having any kind of dialogue. The civilians still want peace. At least the civilians in Israel still want peace. And the festival This year was planned for this Saturday. And a couple of hours before it happened, the Hamas tourists came in And they found when the Israeli army finally liberated, they found the entire family murdered. 2 parents, 3 kids, 3 children together in bed holding hands shot. And this is, I think, the symbol of because Hamas is Trying not just to kill civilians, to kill any chance of there ever being peace. One last thing from broader perspective, The background to all that is that there was a breakthrough for peace recently of sorts after Israel made Peace treaties with the Gulf States, some of them. And now there was on the table the offer for a Saudi peace treaty, which would have normalized relations between Israel and much of the Arab world. And also, hopefully, could have reignited the peace process with the Palestinians and, improve the The situation of millions of Palestinians under Israeli occupation. And most of the experts I'm I'm talking with, they say that this is The at least the immediate cause of the attack, nothing frightens Hamas more than the possibility of peace And the way the attack was conducted, like the atrocities, the, you know, killing babies and and not hiding it, But, actually, filming and and publishing, they want to implant seeds of hatred in the minds of 1,000,000 to make sure there will never be peace. Yuval, thanks very much for giving us, more of your time, and I wanna pick up on something you you said there about how Hamas don't want peace, and they this is in a sense deliberately provoked. And this is something Roy and I talked about in the podcast last week that this May well have been sort of more strategically what lay behind all this. Is there not therefore a need for Israel in its response. Whilst I absolutely under understand the impact upon the national psyche, the demand for security and the demand possibly also for revenge Mhmm. There's a danger that They now actually, to some extent, give Hamas what they want Yes. Which is to wipe out any possibility of ever getting back to a process that might lead to a 2 state solution, which right now feels so far off, it would be a miracle if it ever happened. Yes. I mean, what's happening now is basically what we see, unfortunately, many of these conflicts around the world, a competition of suffering, A competition also, you know, in in public opinion around the world that each side wants to draw more and more attention to its immense pain and suffering. And there is no winner in this competition of suffering except Hamas. Because the terrorists of Hamas, they don't care about human suffering. At least, The they don't care about anything that happens in this world. This is something that I know for many westerners is just difficult to grasp. That level of religious Fanaticism that you have in my region of the world is in many ways incomprehensible to people who who live in a place like London to to most of them. We need to grapple with this. These are people, the hamast terrorists, they don't care at all about what is happening in this world. They don't care about human suffering even on their side. They are fixated on the joys of paradise, which is why they are in love with with death, And they are willing to just burn this world. But Yuval, though there are many Palestinians who live in Gaza, who live in the West Bank, who live in different parts of the world, who don't feel like that. So how must do that? Is it not also the case? Because the last time we spoke, you and Rory and I, very, very critical of Benjamin Netanyahu and who he is and what he represents. But is it not also the case that perhaps the reason they felt able to do this awful thing is because they're surrounded by a sense of hopelessness Yes. Amongst the amongst the peaceful Palestinian people The Israel under Netanyahu and the right wing government you put together have absolutely no interest whatsoever in recognizing their pain even before this. Yeah. Again, the Netanyahu government has abandoned for many years the peace process with the Palestinians, but This doesn't explain Hamas's actions because actually Hamas is never interested in any kind of peace treaty and has done everything in its in its power To undermine previous peace peace processes like the Oslo process. And what ignited this attack is probably that there was suddenly a step From the Israeli side with the Saudi initiative of perhaps reigniting some kind of of of peace process. Now when I hear the voices now coming from Israel, it's it's clear to me that the level of pain is there is so high. There isn't a single millimeter left to recognize or deal with any other pain in the world. It's it's just a psychological fact. Even you? I I don't want to make it personal about about myself. But but but that's who we're talking to. I just wonder how you Yes. I I think this is a war on the on the mind, a war on the soul. And, again, this is deliberate. The way that Hamas Orchestrated this attack. Again, not just attacking civilians, but torturing and executing people in the most horrendous ways they could think about. Taking examples from ISIS and not hiding it, but making sure this will be publicized. This was intentional. Psychologically, what is what is happening is they are not just inciting fear and hatred. This is a in a sense, a crime against humanity. In the deepest sense of the world, you lose all trust in humanity and you thereby also lose your own humanity. And there is a struggle now to, in this sense, at least save our souls and minds from from this destruction. I try to wage this struggle in in my own mind. I think we shouldn't allow Hamas to win the war on our souls. It's impossible at this moment to expect psychologically Israelis to, again, be with anything except their pain. But, I think it is vital. And this is one of the reasons I I'm speaking both here and in Israel to avoid falling into Hamas' Trump and doing things that will ruin any chance for for peace, for generations to come, we shouldn't allow this to happen. Talking about Hamas's trap, there's a a Brazilian Theorist of terrorist, a terrorist called Carlos Marigela, who effectively says that, like, I could read a quote. He says it's necessary to turn political crisis into armed conflict by performing violent actions that will force those in power to transform the political situation of the country Into a military situation. This will alienate the masses who from then on will revolt against the army and the police and blame them for the state of things. To what extent do you feel that Along with the religious agenda, this is a deliberate strategy of Hamas. They actually want to to bring down a huge IDF response, hoping by doing so To bring the masses over onto their side and further alienate them. I can't get into their their their minds and plans, but they knew for for sure That there will be massive Israeli retaliation. They either don't care about it or they actually hope for it. You see that right now, Israel is calling on civilian Palestinian civilians in the north part of the Gaza Strip to leave their houses and move to the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, because obviously, there's going to be major military action in the north. And the Hamas is telling the civil Palestinian civilians, don't go. You have to stay. Whether it's because the Hamas wants to use the civilians as as shields, against, the the Israeli military or because it's just it it's interested in massive casualties on the Palestinian side. Think that, There's a terrible military logic to what they're doing. I mean, they would I think from a military point of view, they would fear that if they evacuate the northern part, allow Israel to Clear and occupy that. Israel will then tell the people in the south to move to the north while they move to the south. So, Hamas, I imagine, sees this like the fight with ISIS in Mosul, urban warfare that would go on for a very long time, and they Yeah. Have no intention of facilitating, making it easier for The Israeli military to conduct urban warfare operations through the Exactly. Through the strip. Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly the point. There is terrible suffering Now in Gaza, and it only gets worse and worse. This terrible situation, I don't know how to solve it. And ideally, we would see movements to deescalate, to return some kind of trust in humanity. The most immediate step that could be taken, is immediately release all the hostages that Hamas took. Again, hostages including babies, old people. And this could you know, a tiny, tiny gesture of of humanity that brings back some sanities to the situation. But, obviously, Hamas is is not not interested in that. No. Their their interest in prisoner swaps. Yeah. And also, I mean, there is a very clear message coming From the Israeli public to the Israeli government, that's it. We cannot go on living here with Hamas. We tried it for many years. It's impossible. You choose either Hamas or Israel. If you'd if Hamas is not completely disarmed, then we can just no longer live here. But does does that not mean, Yuval, that The logic of that is that the IDF virtually wipes the place out, just literally goes in and 1st destroys the north, and if people don't leave, well, that's their problem. That'll be the thinking. And then Maybe tells the people from the south to move back north, which has been destroyed, and then they just destroy the whole place. This is, I think, part of the responsibility of the international community to find some better solution to the situation. But based On the understanding that a return to the status quo before the war is simply totally unacceptable For the Israeli public that however it is done, the war must end with Hamas disarmed And the Gaza Strip demilitarized. And how to do it? I don't know. From the Israeli public's perspective, They cannot settle for for anything less than that. And, you know, I hear many comparisons now with 911, in in United States. And also warnings that Israel should not repeat the American mistake of invading Iraq And look what's happening now in Afghanistan. There is a fundamental flow in the comparison, which is it's like 911, But with the Taliban and ISIS controlling New Jersey, not Afghanistan. I mean, like, my family in Kibbutz Beri, Kibbutz Beri is About a kilometer from the border fence with with Gaza. They cannot go living whoever survived cannot go on living there After what happened with, again, Hamas bases a kilometer from their houses. What happened, Yuval, with the you know, we have this vaunted image of Israeli security systems and the security services. What Hamas did is I mean, his military historians are gonna be writing about this forever. How on earth did this vaunted intelligence and security service not have any sense this was happening or be prepared for it. I don't know the answer, but it is clear already now that This is a price Israel has been is paying for allowing a populist strongman To rule it and to divide it against itself, not just for the last 9 months, but but for years, But many Israelis are saying we took our eyes off the ball. That for months and actually for for for years now, We focused on on the wrong issues, and this came from the top. That when you have a leader, a government That bases its political career on dividing intentionally dividing the nation against itself. On on on giving no importance whatever to telling or hearing the truth, spreading conspiracy theories About the central institutions of the state turning the people against these institutions, Telling people that, the state institutions, they are full of, deep state traitors and attacking the serving elites Of the country, you know, the elites became a dirty word, not just in in in the US, in UK, also in Israel. Nobody wants to be elites. No system Can survive such an attack for for years. The Israeli army is calling this operation, this war, iron swords, iron swords. And I remember my teacher at university like 25 years ago telling me, a military historian, If you put an iron sword in salt water, it rusts. The Netanyahu government has taken Israel's iron swords and put them in saltwater for 14 years, and they rusted. Okay. So, Yuval, Alastair, let's take a quick break. Just following this through, I mean, what about Southern Lebanon? So, obviously, Hezbollah is It's based in Southern Lebanon. If the policy becomes that the only way to defend Israel's security is to try to occupy and control and prevent any terrorist groups Emerging in Gaza. Does the same logic not begin to extend into Southern Lebanon? Again, there is a very big danger there of escalating the conflict Also to Lebanon, also to the West Bank. And, again, it's, I think one very good thing about the very Firm way that the Biden administration intervened is that president Biden is by far the most popular politician in Israel After, you know, most Israelis were very keen Trump supporters. And now president Biden is, I don't know, 99% And, Paul, in his room Remind listeners why that is. What is it that he did that has now made him so popular? He gave the speech that we expected our prime minister to give, But he couldn't. Netanyahu couldn't. And Biden gave us the the speech we needed and sent 2 aircraft carriers And and massive support and making it very, very clear that he's not hedging his bets. He's not seeing this the complexity. No. He's very clearly on Israel's side. And this gives him and his administration a lot of credibility in Israel and enables Him and his into the administration, I hope, to prevent Israel from making huge mistakes. Is is there not a risk that In some ways, this attack will strengthen the hand of the extreme nationalist Israeli right that they will say, this is what we always told you. This is why we can't coexist with these people, and it gives strength to people like Smotrich because it feeds into their narrative. I don't know. This is the battle now being waged in the souls and the minds of Israelis. Because on the one hand, there is these, voices being heard. On the other hand, there is immense rage in Israel against this right wing coalition government That in the name of its messianic fantasies brought Israel to this catastrophic situation. I don't know which which way it will go. I think the country has has been given a chance to save itself. And if If Israelis stay loyal to the ideals of democracy at home and peace abroad. And, again, Israelis are incapable of of hearing this right now, and the the mind is completely filled with pain. But just to avoid Magnifying the pain in the region unnecessarily and keeping a space open So that there will be a possibility of healing later on. This is the best that I can hope for the present moment. Again, this is something that we need help from people in in the rest of the of the world. I'm glad you pointed out the the sort of leadership that Joe Biden has showed and particularly watching Donald Trump yesterday with this It's an absolute nonsense he was coming out with. It would be terrifying if he were in charge of the Western world right now. Yeah. And, also, I completely understand why not just Joe Biden, but other leaders around completely understand why not just Joe Biden, but other leaders around the world have been emphasizing absolute solidarity with Israel. But is there a danger that As this goes on and as people become more and more conscious of the kind of horror that's going to be inflicted upon people in Gaza who are not just Hamas, that we also need world leaders who will speak, if you like, to a more nuanced message that we'll try to use this to get back to. And that does mean something like Netanyahu, who, you know, you have rightly condemned in all pretty clear terms, you know, long before this, that there's a danger that he takes this as kind of permission to do things that, frankly, are gonna take us to places we've never imagined. This is the big danger, and and this is why I was also glad to hear both president Joe Biden and foreign minister Blinken and others. With All the support they give Israel again and again emphasize democracies fight wars by a different standard than Hamas terrorists. If we go down to their standard, what's the point? Yeah. If we become like Hamastov, what's the point? And emphasizing the need to keep International laws. And, again, I I think it's very important this combination of very clear support to Israel and a clear emphasis on the need to keep international law and humanitarian standards Even in the darkest hours. Otherwise, there is no point. Yevo, presumably, the only endpoint to this will have to be And Israeli occupation of Gaza in the long term because I can't see how else Israel can guarantee that Hamas will not reemerge. Yeah. And hopefully, there will be. And nobody will fight Hamas for Israel. I think this is quite clear. But I hope there will be forces Who will take it upon themselves not just to rebuild Gaza in a way which gives a future to the Palestinians there, but also Simultaneously takes it upon itself to disarm Hamas and to make sure that it doesn't remilitarize the Gaza Strip. Who will be these forces that will take upon themselves this immense task? I don't know. But we must find such forces because the the alternatives are really Too difficult to even imagine. So, essentially, you're saying that if Israel is not acting as the occupying force demilitarizing, The hope would be that some other group of people, the United Nations or Arab countries or somebody else, would take security responsibility for Gaza and responsibility for its economic development in order to ensure that Hamas doesn't reemerge. Yeah. Again, you you have the Palestinian authority, which is discredited, but it's still then it's politics. You have to work With whatever forces are are there. And you have more moderate Arab countries. You have the international community. A coalition of the willing. Whoever is willing to take it upon themselves, it's not going to be easy. It's going to be very expensive. But if you really care About the suffering of people in the area, this is the thing to do. But, unfortunately, as we've discussed before, the context is not very favorable. I mean, we're in a context of isolationism. People are very bruised. The liberal world order seem to collapse. People are overextended towards Ukraine. It's very, very improbable, sadly, that anybody is gonna have the appetite for getting involved with what will seem from the distance The most painful, horrifying political situation on Earth. I mean, I don't think the international community is likely to be volunteering at all for that. Yuval, there's the situation of the hostages. So Netanyahu, in a previous incarnation, one of his previous premiership periods, And he did this extraordinary exchange over the IDF soldier, Gilead Shariat, and exchange more than a 1000 Palestinian prisoners, including some very, very senior Hamas figures. So you've got that, and then you've got the fact of the security and intelligence failures. And if we think back to the previous when Israel Israeli security has failed, there's been real anger that has really turned against political leaders over the security failures. What is the putting to one side, if you can, I know how hard this is, your personal view that Netanyahu is a very bad man and a very bad prime minister? What's your sense of how Israeli opinion is rallying to him as a leader? And do you think that the one of the reasons that the that Hamas have have taken so many hostages is because of what they took from that previous exchange 17 years ago. Oh, Hamas obviously knows that Israel is extremely sensitive to hostages, and they plan to get to play this card For maximum effect, which means, again, for maximum terror and hatred, creating more and more of that. And Israelis now have very little confidence in the leadership of of Netanyahu. He can still in a way I mean, It's beyond him to resign. I mean, he can't do what Chamberlain did in 1940 and just move aside and give Somebody better. I mean, this is what he should have done. He can't. I think he can't. But maybe maybe he can still Do something very simple but very difficult. Just give a speech to the Israeli public and say, I'm responsible. I ran this country for 14 years. I divided the nation against itself. I'm responsible for this catastrophe. I will pay the full price. I don't think this is the moment for me to step down. There is nobody else. So I'll do this one job, but know that I take full responsibility and I will pay the price. And based on that, now let me do my best with this extremely difficult situation. If you would just utter these, like, 5, 6 sentences, He can still, in a way, unite. The people are extremely angry against him, but I I'm not sure if he's capable of of doing such a gesture. And, Yuval, to now bring in the Palestinian voice. Yes. I mean, I I mean, I don't don't presume to be able to speak on their behalf, but My sense is that mainstream Palestinian opinion sees this in terms of Gaza being a extended prison camp is the way that they think about it. That Gaza is supposed to be the beginning of a two state solution and independent country, not so much New Jersey as Mexico and its relationship to the United tickets. And so I think Palestinians hearing this would be completely horrified at the idea that this would then lead to And Israeli occupation of Gaza. I I can say this that just as Israelis have so much pain that they don't have any space To even acknowledge the pain of others, I think this is the same is true of Palestinians. We've been living under horrible conditions For decades, millions of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and also the conditions in Gaza. And again, I don't expect them. I I think that that psychologically, most people in this situation, they don't have any space left For even acknowledging the pain of others. And you can condemn this. You can say I think it's a psychological fact. It's it's impossible. And also, you know, we need simple stories. Even though this is the case in most conflicts in the world, it's hard to people to understand that you can be victim and perpetrator at the same time. It's a very simple fact, impossible to accept for most people. Either you're a victim Oh, you're a pet portrait. Well, there is no other but no. Usually, we are both. You know, from the level of individuals, how we behave in our family to the level of entire nations, Yeah. Usually both. And, of course, perhaps one issue is that we don't feel like that as individuals. We don't feel that we have the full responsibility for our state. So there's a sort of Strange problem here too, which is that you feel as an individual that you're a victim, and you feel distanced from your state or your The fellow Palestinians or fellow Israelis as perpetrators. So you you don't feel a direct responsibility in that way? Exactly. And the the most we can hope For the again, outside intervention is a different matter that I think what I would expect people say in London or in New York Or, in Sao Paulo, in Beijing, because you're not in this immense pain, you can try and see both sides instead of kind of Making your life easier by just dividing the world into only victims and only perpetrators. Israelis and Palestinians at this moment can't, But I expect that people in other countries will have the capacity to do that instead of going for the easy solution of, no, there is just this Two sided story. What we can hope is to think how do we get out of this pit of despair? And going back to the Hamas attack, I mean, whatever one thinks about the misery of Palestinians under Israeli occupation, how does Murdering parents in front of their children going to help this. But do you think that by doing that, you will Solve the occupation? You will incentivize Israelis to make peace? Obviously not. So, in this Competition of immense suffering. It's there is no calculus of suffering that can calculate who is suffering more. So focus on the question, what is still possible to do that at some point in the future, there might be reconciliation and peace. Because one last comment on that, we do know from history That even though it seems utterly impossible at the moment, over the longer term of decades, of generations, the wounds do heal. And if people make the right decision, it is possible. You know, we are not only, I don't know, French and Germans or English and Scots, after all but also Ireland. Or Ireland. Yeah. I've just read about, you know, looking at relation between Poland, Ukraine, and Lithuania. And people don't really know this, but we all know about the wars in the Balkans in the 19 nineties, which were re fought over Injuries done decades and centuries previously between Serbs and Croats and Bosnians and and and so forth. The nobody remembers the wars that weren't fought between Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Belarus in the 19 nineties. Why? Because there were no wars. Even though there was a lot of historical injuries between these peoples, there was a conscious decision At the end of the Cold War that we will not go back in history, the massacres, the horror horrible things It's done in the 19 forties. And earlier, we don't forget them, but we don't want to go back there. Very quickly. I mean, I think and I'm gonna hand to Alastair to to finish. But, I mean, I think, You know, this is a show which is about politics, and at the core of these questions is the politicians. I mean, in a way, the reason why Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Kosovo went to war is actually because the politicians chose to whip up that nationalism. Yes. And and as you say, in the case of Poland, Ukraine, Belarus not to go in that direction, which puts an immense responsibility in the end on the Palestinian and Israeli leadership here because People in these moments of trauma can be led can be led in positive directions, can be led in deeply, deeply negative directions. And And the notion that it's just a fundamental fact about people, I think underestimates the the politicians' agency. Yeah. And what I said earlier about the psychological, limits of us as human beings, this is not an excuse for the politicians. The politicians out there, this is their job. This is what is the job of being a politician? This is the job that you try to go you're not an ordinary citizen. You have a higher responsibility. You have a historical responsibility. And we now need to see whether the leaders, the politicians on all sides have this kind of responsibility. History has its eyes on them. What they decide to do in the next few days, weeks Will reverberate really for for generations. And I hope they do the responsible thing. And the responsible thing, you know, going back to to hospital. When there is an injury, your responsibility is to heal it, not to widen it, not to use the injury as an excuse For more injuries. How do you translate that into policies in extremely difficult situations? I'm not a politician. One of the reasons I don't go into politics, I don't know how to do that. That demands very, very tough skills. And, you know, like, I think it was true, and I said, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Right. Right. So, this is the moment of heat. And if you have politicians who just have no idea what to do in this situation, step aside and let somebody else. Yuval, you're in you're in London With Rory, I'm in Paris. Before you leave, if you can, take a look at Rory mentioned Ireland. Take a look at the BBC documentary series that's they had recently called once upon a time in Northern Ireland because I think you made the point there that change can come when it feels Absolutely impossible. And I can't imagine what it's like for you, for every Israeli, for every person living in the West Bank and Gaza and Jews and Palestinians around the world, utterly, utterly horrific, but it is one of the most hopeful TV things I've ever watched. But finally from me, and thanks for giving us so much of your time, but finally from me, you mentioned there the politicians. There's there's 3 I want to sort of get your sense and maybe also Rory's sense of how you think they're viewing this. The first is Khamenei in Iran Mhmm. And whether I'm not asking you to get inside his head, but how you think that might be going. Putin in Moscow and also Zelensky. Because I've my other fear for this is that it's going to take the world's attention away from another really difficult situation in in a way that could be very, very damaging to Ukraine. So what's your take on those 3 and how they'll be looking at this? I think Khamenei's, like, Official title is the spiritual leader of Iran. Right? Now what is spirituality? I mean, what is a spiritual leader? What does a spiritual leader do in a situation of this immense suffering? Let's see. What is the quality of spirituality of the Iranian spiritual leadership. I don't know. Let let's see. With regard to Putin, I think, you know, I I can't get into the mind of of such a person, But given the horrors that he unleashed on the Ukrainian people, I don't think this person can have any kind of compassion. Maybe just rejoices as more and more of the world goes up in flame. And, also, again, diverting attention From his crimes and from the threat that he poses. Zelensky, again, I think Zelensky is besides being an inspiring Leader of Ukraine, I think is the most inspiring Jewish leader of our time. What is done in in Ukraine is absolutely amazing, Especially given, again, the very, very difficult history of Jews and Ukrainians. The fact that Ukrainians have chosen a Jewish person To lead them at their greatest hour of need and the the way he leads them. This is absolutely anybody, you know, all these kind of very nationalistic views That you can't be both a Ukrainian and a Jew and absolute nonsense. I mean, he is showing the world what true patriotism is. And also his reaction now. You know, Israel in many ways turned a cold shoulder to Ukraine in its hour of greatest need, Being very, very careful about how it phrases itself on the conflict so as not to anger the Russians because we have our own interests to take into account And being quite stingy in the way that the the help that we, extend to Ukraine. And A bit like president Biden, Zelensky didn't, didn't use it to ah, you didn't do this for me, so I'll now show no. Bargain. Yeah. Like, Very, very clear. And offering to come to Israel. You know, his country is under this vicious attack. And he says, I know from my experience How important it is in your hour of desperation and pain that foreign leaders come and and be just be there with you. And I want to come and be there with you despite the fact that the war the terrible war is still ongoing. And, you know, Israel is not really under an existential Threat in the way that Ukraine is. Hamas cannot conquer Israel. Ukraine is still in danger of being Concorde and obliterated by the Russian army. And you Zelensky says, I I want to come and be with you. So this is so inspiring. I mean, just and I suggest very quickly on your question there. I mean, I think the The terrible logic here is stepping back from Israel, Palestine for a second is just the explosion of conflict Since 2014. I mean, almost every year Yeah. Over the last 9 years, we've had more civilian casualties, more refugees, more displaced people. We've had nearly 7 coups in in Africa in just over a year. We have the horror of Ukraine. We now have the unbelievable horror of what's happening in Israel and Palestine. I mean, there is a sense that this popular stage is also coinciding with the an age of increasing violence. Yeah. And it's very simple. You destroy the global order, You got this order. I mean, how it can't be any simpler than that. We have had for several years now leaders, including in the UK, in the USA, That openly say, we don't want a global order anymore. We care only about our own country. Again, you can say whatever you want about how these leaders take care of the interests of their country. What is very clear is that none of them came with an offer of how to arrange the global order. They're against the very idea of a global order. And what's the alternative to order? Chaos. If you don't work, and it's hard work to build the global order, what you get is these increasing waves of We had pandemic and famine and now war, and there will be more and more of that if we do not reestablish order. And I haven't heard any suggestion from anywhere in the world for a better order than the besmirched liberal order, which is based again on a very Basic understanding that all humans share the same basic experiences, and therefore, we all share some Common interests. It's biological that pain and and despair and sadness, they are the same In Israelis and Palestinians, in Russians and Ukrainians, and this simple realization is the basis for the liberal global order. We are all humans, And we have shared experiences. We have shared interests. And we haven't heard from all these puthines and or buns and trumps. We haven't heard any alternative idea. So what would you base a global order on if not on these shared experiences and interests and values. And if you don't have any alternative suggestion, then we need to go back And reestablish on better foundations the only offer on the table, which is the liberal global order. Well, Yuval, honestly, it's been yet again Great to talk to you. Thanks for your time. Thanks above all, I think, even in such a horrific time for you, your people, What you stand for, what you believe in, still able to try to articulate some of the deeper things that are going on here and why These things are not always as simple as they seem from a from a quick headline, a quick snapshot. I think your voice is really, really important in this whole debate and Power to your elbow and keeping going. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to The Restless Politics. I'm here in London, and Alastair and I are about to interview Yuval Noah Harari. It's a very different type of episode to what we normally do because often we're going for analysts. We're stepping back from situations. In this case, we're talking to a friend of mine within a week of the events that unfolded with Hamas's terrorist attacks across the border from Gaza.\n\nHe is right in the middle of this, and you will feel in the interview, Joaovel's own personal emotions, his connection to his own family in Israel. I'm not apologizing for that at all. I think if you would like, attempt to get a more objective picture of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, please listen to our last Episode that we put out a few days ago, which tries to look at the bigger history. But I think it's vital in these things to actually hear from people who are fully engaged, who are connected emotionally because only by doing so, I think, do we ever get a sense of how these problems feel, why they're so difficult to resolve. And I think Yuval is a fascinating example of somebody who has been deeply emotionally traumatized, who feels deep attachment to Israel, but is also Finding his way towards talking about peace and empathy, and I think that emotional journey makes this episode even more powerful than some of our other episodes.\n\nI hope you enjoyed. Today I mean, it's a very, very difficult, sad day for recording, and my friend Yuval, who we've interviewed a couple of times in the last month, has, Come back to join us after the horrifying terrorist attack of Hamas in in Israel and and now very, very disturbing Ideas around how the Israeli army might respond in Gaza. And Yuval is right in the middle of this. As as people remember who listen to the leading podcasts, he has been a Very outspoken critic of the populism of the Israeli government and particularly their judicial reforms, but he's also found himself caught up as an Israeli and as a family member in the consequences of this attack. So, thank you very much for joining us.\n\nSpeaker 2: Thank you for having me again.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe if we can start with Just give giving listeners a sense of of how this attack felt, how it touched on your own family, how it felt personally, How Israelis understand it. Before we go on to to try to talk about our structures, but just the immediate emotional impact.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I mean, it it goes back to the deepest fears and the darkest moments of Jewish history. At first, people compared it to the Yom Kippur War When the armies of Egypt and Syria surprised Israel, but very quickly the the narrative changed, And everybody's now comparing it, to scenes from the holocaust or from pogroms. The state of Israel for a couple of hours just disappeared. There was no state.\n\nThe Jewish communities slaughtered. The comparisons are with the mobile killing units of the Nazis That in 1941, 1942 would in places that of today, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, will just Come surround a Jewish village and just either burn people in their houses or just shoot them all to death. And also comparisons with pogroms even earlier, like the famous Kishinev pogrom of 1919 3. And we hear just Stories that we couldn't imagine. Like, we are used to wars, but the idea that there will be massive pogroms in Jews in Israel in 2023, it's just Incomprehensible.\n\nI have family in 1 and friends in in several of of these kibbutzim, of these villages that bore the brunt of the attack. My aunt and uncle live in Kibbutz Bary. All contact with them was cut on the morning of the of the attack. We just got news that they somehow survived. They hid in their house as Hamas terrorists just went from house to house in the in the kibbutz And just slaughtered, everybody.\n\nAnd we hear terrible stories about families hiding in in safe rooms, And then the Hamas setting fire to the house to burn them alive or suffocate them in the safe room. And if they try to jump or come out, they just shoot them. I've heard also 1 really I think it encapsulates because these communities, the kibbutzim on the border with Gaza, They were one of the last bastions of the left wing in Israel. People who still clang to the belief in peace Through all those years of of of terrorism and attacks. So one really terrible story I've heard from Faraza, a kibbutz where I have many friends, A family that for couple of years organized this kite festival of flying kites On the fence border with Gaza with messages of peace to show the civilians in Gaza that despite All the violence and, you know, the impossibility of the government of Israel and Hamas having any kind of dialogue.\n\nThe civilians still want peace. At least the civilians in Israel still want peace. And the festival This year was planned for this Saturday. And a couple of hours before it happened, the Hamas tourists came in And they found when the Israeli army finally liberated, they found the entire family murdered. 2 parents, 3 kids, 3 children together in bed holding hands shot.\n\nAnd this is, I think, the symbol of because Hamas is Trying not just to kill civilians, to kill any chance of there ever being peace. One last thing from broader perspective, The background to all that is that there was a breakthrough for peace recently of sorts after Israel made Peace treaties with the Gulf States, some of them. And now there was on the table the offer for a Saudi peace treaty, which would have normalized relations between Israel and much of the Arab world. And also, hopefully, could have reignited the peace process with the Palestinians and, improve the The situation of millions of Palestinians under Israeli occupation. And most of the experts I'm I'm talking with, they say that this is The at least the immediate cause of the attack, nothing frightens Hamas more than the possibility of peace And the way the attack was conducted, like the atrocities, the, you know, killing babies and and not hiding it, But, actually, filming and and publishing, they want to implant seeds of hatred in the minds of 1,000,000 to make sure there will never be peace.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yuval, thanks very much for giving us, more of your time, and I wanna pick up on something you you said there about how Hamas don't want peace, and they this is in a sense deliberately provoked. And this is something Roy and I talked about in the podcast last week that this May well have been sort of more strategically what lay behind all this. Is there not therefore a need for Israel in its response. Whilst I absolutely under understand the impact upon the national psyche, the demand for security and the demand possibly also for revenge\n\nSpeaker 2: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: There's a danger that They now actually, to some extent, give Hamas what they want\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which is to wipe out any possibility of ever getting back to a process that might lead to a 2 state solution, which right now feels so far off, it would be a miracle if it ever happened.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I mean, what's happening now is basically what we see, unfortunately, many of these conflicts around the world, a competition of suffering, A competition also, you know, in in public opinion around the world that each side wants to draw more and more attention to its immense pain and suffering. And there is no winner in this competition of suffering except Hamas. Because the terrorists of Hamas, they don't care about human suffering. At least, The they don't care about anything that happens in this world.\n\nThis is something that I know for many westerners is just difficult to grasp. That level of religious Fanaticism that you have in my region of the world is in many ways incomprehensible to people who who live in a place like London to to most of them. We need to grapple with this. These are people, the hamast terrorists, they don't care at all about what is happening in this world. They don't care about human suffering even on their side.\n\nThey are fixated on the joys of paradise, which is why they are in love with with death, And they are willing to just burn this world.\n\nSpeaker 0: But Yuval, though there are many Palestinians who live in Gaza, who live in the West Bank, who live in different parts of the world, who don't feel like that. So how must do that? Is it not also the case? Because the last time we spoke, you and Rory and I, very, very critical of Benjamin Netanyahu and who he is and what he represents. But is it not also the case that perhaps the reason they felt able to do this awful thing is because they're surrounded by a sense of hopelessness Yes.\n\nAmongst the amongst the peaceful Palestinian people The Israel under Netanyahu and the right wing government you put together have absolutely no interest whatsoever in recognizing their pain even before this.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Again, the Netanyahu government has abandoned for many years the peace process with the Palestinians, but This doesn't explain Hamas's actions because actually Hamas is never interested in any kind of peace treaty and has done everything in its in its power To undermine previous peace peace processes like the Oslo process. And what ignited this attack is probably that there was suddenly a step From the Israeli side with the Saudi initiative of perhaps reigniting some kind of of of peace process. Now when I hear the voices now coming from Israel, it's it's clear to me that the level of pain is there is so high. There isn't a single millimeter left to recognize or deal with any other pain in the world.\n\nIt's it's just a psychological fact.\n\nSpeaker 0: Even you?\n\nSpeaker 2: I I don't want to make it personal about about myself.\n\nSpeaker 0: But but but that's who we're talking to. I just wonder how you Yes.\n\nSpeaker 2: I I think this is a war on the on the mind, a war on the soul. And, again, this is deliberate. The way that Hamas Orchestrated this attack. Again, not just attacking civilians, but torturing and executing people in the most horrendous ways they could think about. Taking examples from ISIS and not hiding it, but making sure this will be publicized.\n\nThis was intentional. Psychologically, what is what is happening is they are not just inciting fear and hatred. This is a in a sense, a crime against humanity. In the deepest sense of the world, you lose all trust in humanity and you thereby also lose your own humanity. And there is a struggle now to, in this sense, at least save our souls and minds from from this destruction.\n\nI try to wage this struggle in in my own mind. I think we shouldn't allow Hamas to win the war on our souls. It's impossible at this moment to expect psychologically Israelis to, again, be with anything except their pain. But, I think it is vital. And this is one of the reasons I I'm speaking both here and in Israel to avoid falling into Hamas' Trump and doing things that will ruin any chance for for peace, for generations to come, we shouldn't allow this to happen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Talking about Hamas's trap, there's a a Brazilian Theorist of terrorist, a terrorist called Carlos Marigela, who effectively says that, like, I could read a quote. He says it's necessary to turn political crisis into armed conflict by performing violent actions that will force those in power to transform the political situation of the country Into a military situation. This will alienate the masses who from then on will revolt against the army and the police and blame them for the state of things. To what extent do you feel that Along with the religious agenda, this is a deliberate strategy of Hamas. They actually want to to bring down a huge IDF response, hoping by doing so To bring the masses over onto their side and further alienate them.\n\nSpeaker 2: I can't get into their their their minds and plans, but they knew for for sure That there will be massive Israeli retaliation. They either don't care about it or they actually hope for it. You see that right now, Israel is calling on civilian Palestinian civilians in the north part of the Gaza Strip to leave their houses and move to the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, because obviously, there's going to be major military action in the north. And the Hamas is telling the civil Palestinian civilians, don't go. You have to stay.\n\nWhether it's because the Hamas wants to use the civilians as as shields, against, the the Israeli military or because it's just it it's interested in massive casualties on the Palestinian side.\n\nSpeaker 1: Think that, There's a terrible military logic to what they're doing. I mean, they would I think from a military point of view, they would fear that if they evacuate the northern part, allow Israel to Clear and occupy that. Israel will then tell the people in the south to move to the north while they move to the south. So, Hamas, I imagine, sees this like the fight with ISIS in Mosul, urban warfare that would go on for a very long time, and they Yeah. Have no intention of facilitating, making it easier for The Israeli military to conduct urban warfare operations through the\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Through the strip. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. That's exactly the point. There is terrible suffering Now in Gaza, and it only gets worse and worse. This terrible situation, I don't know how to solve it. And ideally, we would see movements to deescalate, to return some kind of trust in humanity.\n\nThe most immediate step that could be taken, is immediately release all the hostages that Hamas took. Again, hostages including babies, old people. And this could you know, a tiny, tiny gesture of of humanity that brings back some sanities to the situation. But, obviously, Hamas is is not not interested in that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Their their interest in prisoner swaps.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And also, I mean, there is a very clear message coming From the Israeli public to the Israeli government, that's it. We cannot go on living here with Hamas. We tried it for many years. It's impossible.\n\nYou choose either Hamas or Israel. If you'd if Hamas is not completely disarmed, then we can just no longer live here.\n\nSpeaker 0: But does does that not mean, Yuval, that The logic of that is that the IDF virtually wipes the place out, just literally goes in and 1st destroys the north, and if people don't leave, well, that's their problem. That'll be the thinking. And then Maybe tells the people from the south to move back north, which has been destroyed, and then they just destroy the whole place.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is, I think, part of the responsibility of the international community to find some better solution to the situation. But based On the understanding that a return to the status quo before the war is simply totally unacceptable For the Israeli public that however it is done, the war must end with Hamas disarmed And the Gaza Strip demilitarized. And how to do it? I don't know. From the Israeli public's perspective, They cannot settle for for anything less than that.\n\nAnd, you know, I hear many comparisons now with 911, in in United States. And also warnings that Israel should not repeat the American mistake of invading Iraq And look what's happening now in Afghanistan. There is a fundamental flow in the comparison, which is it's like 911, But with the Taliban and ISIS controlling New Jersey, not Afghanistan. I mean, like, my family in Kibbutz Beri, Kibbutz Beri is About a kilometer from the border fence with with Gaza. They cannot go living whoever survived cannot go on living there After what happened with, again, Hamas bases a kilometer from their houses.\n\nSpeaker 0: What happened, Yuval, with the you know, we have this vaunted image of Israeli security systems and the security services. What Hamas did is I mean, his military historians are gonna be writing about this forever. How on earth did this vaunted intelligence and security service not have any sense this was happening or be prepared for\n\nSpeaker 2: it. I don't know the answer, but it is clear already now that This is a price Israel has been is paying for allowing a populist strongman To rule it and to divide it against itself, not just for the last 9 months, but but for years, But many Israelis are saying we took our eyes off the ball. That for months and actually for for for years now, We focused on on the wrong issues, and this came from the top. That when you have a leader, a government That bases its political career on dividing intentionally dividing the nation against itself. On on on giving no importance whatever to telling or hearing the truth, spreading conspiracy theories About the central institutions of the state turning the people against these institutions, Telling people that, the state institutions, they are full of, deep state traitors and attacking the serving elites Of the country, you know, the elites became a dirty word, not just in in in the US, in UK, also in Israel.\n\nNobody wants to be elites. No system Can survive such an attack for for years. The Israeli army is calling this operation, this war, iron swords, iron swords. And I remember my teacher at university like 25 years ago telling me, a military historian, If you put an iron sword in salt water, it rusts. The Netanyahu government has taken Israel's iron swords and put them in saltwater for 14 years, and they rusted.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, Yuval, Alastair, let's take a quick break. Just following this through, I mean, what about Southern Lebanon? So, obviously, Hezbollah is It's based in Southern Lebanon. If the policy becomes that the only way to defend Israel's security is to try to occupy and control and prevent any terrorist groups Emerging in Gaza.\n\nDoes the same logic not begin to extend into Southern Lebanon?\n\nSpeaker 2: Again, there is a very big danger there of escalating the conflict Also to Lebanon, also to the West Bank. And, again, it's, I think one very good thing about the very Firm way that the Biden administration intervened is that president Biden is by far the most popular politician in Israel After, you know, most Israelis were very keen Trump supporters. And now president Biden is, I don't know, 99% And, Paul, in his room\n\nSpeaker 1: Remind listeners why that is. What is it that he did that has now made him so popular?\n\nSpeaker 2: He gave the speech that we expected our prime minister to give, But he couldn't. Netanyahu couldn't. And Biden gave us the the speech we needed and sent 2 aircraft carriers And and massive support and making it very, very clear that he's not hedging his bets. He's not seeing this the complexity. No.\n\nHe's very clearly on Israel's side. And this gives him and his administration a lot of credibility in Israel and enables Him and his into the administration, I hope, to prevent Israel from making huge mistakes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is is there not a risk that In some ways, this attack will strengthen the hand of the extreme nationalist Israeli right that they will say, this is what we always told you. This is why we can't coexist with these people, and it gives strength to people like Smotrich because it feeds into their narrative.\n\nSpeaker 2: I don't know. This is the battle now being waged in the souls and the minds of Israelis. Because on the one hand, there is these, voices being heard. On the other hand, there is immense rage in Israel against this right wing coalition government That in the name of its messianic fantasies brought Israel to this catastrophic situation. I don't know which which way it will go.\n\nI think the country has has been given a chance to save itself. And if If Israelis stay loyal to the ideals of democracy at home and peace abroad. And, again, Israelis are incapable of of hearing this right now, and the the mind is completely filled with pain. But just to avoid Magnifying the pain in the region unnecessarily and keeping a space open So that there will be a possibility of healing later on. This is the best that I can hope for the present moment.\n\nAgain, this is something that we need help from people in in the rest of the of the world.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm glad you pointed out the the sort of leadership that Joe Biden has showed and particularly watching Donald Trump yesterday with this It's an absolute nonsense he was coming out with. It would be terrifying if he were in charge of the Western world right now.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And, also, I completely understand why\n\nSpeaker 2: not just Joe Biden, but\n\nSpeaker 0: other leaders around completely understand why not just Joe Biden, but other leaders around the world have been emphasizing absolute solidarity with Israel. But is there a danger that As this goes on and as people become more and more conscious of the kind of horror that's going to be inflicted upon people in Gaza who are not just Hamas, that we also need world leaders who will speak, if you like, to a more nuanced message that we'll try to use this to get back to. And that does mean something like Netanyahu, who, you know, you have rightly condemned in all pretty clear terms, you know, long before this, that there's a danger that he takes this as kind of permission to do things that, frankly, are gonna take us to places we've never imagined.\n\nSpeaker 2: This is the big danger, and and this is why I was also glad to hear both president Joe Biden and foreign minister Blinken and others. With All the support they give Israel again and again emphasize democracies fight wars by a different standard than Hamas terrorists. If we go down to their standard, what's the point? Yeah. If we become like Hamastov, what's the point?\n\nAnd emphasizing the need to keep International laws. And, again, I I think it's very important this combination of very clear support to Israel and a clear emphasis on the need to keep international law and humanitarian standards Even in the darkest hours. Otherwise, there is no point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yevo, presumably, the only endpoint to this will have to be And Israeli occupation of Gaza in the long term because I can't see how else Israel can guarantee that Hamas will not reemerge. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: And hopefully, there will be. And nobody will fight Hamas for Israel. I think this is quite clear. But I hope there will be forces Who will take it upon themselves not just to rebuild Gaza in a way which gives a future to the Palestinians there, but also Simultaneously takes it upon itself to disarm Hamas and to make sure that it doesn't remilitarize the Gaza Strip. Who will be these forces that will take upon themselves this immense task?\n\nI don't know. But we must find such forces because the the alternatives are really Too difficult to even imagine.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, essentially, you're saying that if Israel is not acting as the occupying force demilitarizing, The hope would be that some other group of people, the United Nations or Arab countries or somebody else, would take security responsibility for Gaza and responsibility for its economic development in order to ensure that Hamas doesn't\n\nSpeaker 0: reemerge.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Again, you you have the Palestinian authority, which is discredited, but it's still then it's politics. You have to work With whatever forces are are there. And you have more moderate Arab countries. You have the international community.\n\nA coalition of the willing. Whoever is willing to take it upon themselves, it's not going to be easy. It's going to be very expensive. But if you really care About the suffering of people in the area, this is the thing to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, unfortunately, as we've discussed before, the context is not very favorable. I mean, we're in a context of isolationism. People are very bruised. The liberal world order seem to collapse. People are overextended towards Ukraine.\n\nIt's very, very improbable, sadly, that anybody is gonna have the appetite for getting involved with what will seem from the distance The most painful, horrifying political situation on Earth. I mean, I don't think the international community is likely to be volunteering at all for that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yuval, there's the situation of the hostages. So Netanyahu, in a previous incarnation, one of his previous premiership periods, And he did this extraordinary exchange over the IDF soldier, Gilead Shariat, and exchange more than a 1000 Palestinian prisoners, including some very, very senior Hamas figures. So you've got that, and then you've got the fact of the security and intelligence failures. And if we think back to the previous when Israel Israeli security has failed, there's been real anger that has really turned against political leaders over the security failures. What is the putting to one side, if you can, I know how hard this is, your personal view that Netanyahu is a very bad man and a very bad prime minister?\n\nWhat's your sense of how Israeli opinion is rallying to him as a leader? And do you think that the one of the reasons that the that Hamas have have taken so many hostages is because of what they took from that previous exchange 17 years ago.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, Hamas obviously knows that Israel is extremely sensitive to hostages, and they plan to get to play this card For maximum effect, which means, again, for maximum terror and hatred, creating more and more of that. And Israelis now have very little confidence in the leadership of of Netanyahu. He can still in a way I mean, It's beyond him to resign. I mean, he can't do what Chamberlain did in 1940 and just move aside and give Somebody better. I mean, this is what he should have done.\n\nHe can't. I think he can't. But maybe maybe he can still Do something very simple but very difficult. Just give a speech to the Israeli public and say, I'm responsible. I ran this country for 14 years.\n\nI divided the nation against itself. I'm responsible for this catastrophe. I will pay the full price. I don't think this is the moment for me to step down. There is nobody else.\n\nSo I'll do this one job, but know that I take full responsibility and I will pay the price. And based on that, now let me do my best with this extremely difficult situation. If you would just utter these, like, 5, 6 sentences, He can still, in a way, unite. The people are extremely angry against him, but I I'm not sure if he's capable of of doing such a gesture.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, Yuval, to now bring in the Palestinian voice.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I I mean, I don't don't presume to be able to speak on their behalf, but My sense is that mainstream Palestinian opinion sees this in terms of Gaza being a extended prison camp is the way that they think about it. That Gaza is supposed to be the beginning of a two state solution and independent country, not so much New Jersey as Mexico and its relationship to the United tickets. And so I think Palestinians hearing this would be completely horrified at the idea that this would then lead to And Israeli occupation of Gaza.\n\nSpeaker 2: I I can say this that just as Israelis have so much pain that they don't have any space To even acknowledge the pain of others, I think this is the same is true of Palestinians. We've been living under horrible conditions For decades, millions of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and also the conditions in Gaza. And again, I don't expect them. I I think that that psychologically, most people in this situation, they don't have any space left For even acknowledging the pain of others. And you can condemn this.\n\nYou can say I think it's a psychological fact. It's it's impossible. And also, you know, we need simple stories. Even though this is the case in most conflicts in the world, it's hard to people to understand that you can be victim and perpetrator at the same time. It's a very simple fact, impossible to accept for most people.\n\nEither you're a victim Oh, you're a pet portrait. Well, there is no other but no. Usually, we are both. You know, from the level of individuals, how we behave in our family to the level of entire nations, Yeah. Usually both.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, of course, perhaps one issue is that we don't feel like that as individuals. We don't feel that we have the full responsibility for our state. So there's a sort of Strange problem here too, which is that you feel as an individual that you're a victim, and you feel distanced from your state or your The fellow Palestinians or fellow Israelis as perpetrators. So you you don't feel a direct responsibility in that way?\n\nSpeaker 2: Exactly. And the the most we can hope For the again, outside intervention is a different matter that I think what I would expect people say in London or in New York Or, in Sao Paulo, in Beijing, because you're not in this immense pain, you can try and see both sides instead of kind of Making your life easier by just dividing the world into only victims and only perpetrators. Israelis and Palestinians at this moment can't, But I expect that people in other countries will have the capacity to do that instead of going for the easy solution of, no, there is just this Two sided story. What we can hope is to think how do we get out of this pit of despair? And going back to the Hamas attack, I mean, whatever one thinks about the misery of Palestinians under Israeli occupation, how does Murdering parents in front of their children going to help this.\n\nBut do you think that by doing that, you will Solve the occupation? You will incentivize Israelis to make peace? Obviously not. So, in this Competition of immense suffering. It's there is no calculus of suffering that can calculate who is suffering more.\n\nSo focus on the question, what is still possible to do that at some point in the future, there might be reconciliation and peace. Because one last comment on that, we do know from history That even though it seems utterly impossible at the moment, over the longer term of decades, of generations, the wounds do heal. And if people make the right decision, it is possible. You know, we are not only, I don't know, French and Germans or English and Scots, after all but\n\nSpeaker 1: also Ireland.\n\nSpeaker 2: Or Ireland. Yeah. I've just read about, you know, looking at relation between Poland, Ukraine, and Lithuania. And people don't really know this, but we all know about the wars in the Balkans in the 19 nineties, which were re fought over Injuries done decades and centuries previously between Serbs and Croats and Bosnians and and and so forth. The nobody remembers the wars that weren't fought between Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Belarus in the 19 nineties.\n\nWhy? Because there were no wars. Even though there was a lot of historical injuries between these peoples, there was a conscious decision At the end of the Cold War that we will not go back in history, the massacres, the horror horrible things It's done in the 19 forties. And earlier, we don't forget them, but we don't want to go back there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very quickly. I mean, I think and I'm gonna hand to Alastair to to finish. But, I mean, I think, You know, this is a show which is about politics, and at the core of these questions is the politicians. I mean, in a way, the reason why Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, Kosovo went to war is actually because the politicians chose to whip up that nationalism. Yes.\n\nAnd and as you say, in the case of Poland, Ukraine, Belarus not to go in that direction, which puts an immense responsibility in the end on the Palestinian and Israeli leadership here because People in these moments of trauma can be led can be led in positive directions, can be led in deeply, deeply negative directions. And And the notion that it's just a fundamental fact about people, I think underestimates the the politicians' agency.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And what I said earlier about the psychological, limits of us as human beings, this is not an excuse for the politicians. The politicians out there, this is their job. This is what is the job of being a politician? This is the job that you try to go you're not an ordinary citizen.\n\nYou have a higher responsibility. You have a historical responsibility. And we now need to see whether the leaders, the politicians on all sides have this kind of responsibility. History has its eyes on them. What they decide to do in the next few days, weeks Will reverberate really for for generations.\n\nAnd I hope they do the responsible thing. And the responsible thing, you know, going back to to hospital. When there is an injury, your responsibility is to heal it, not to widen it, not to use the injury as an excuse For more injuries. How do you translate that into policies in extremely difficult situations? I'm not a politician.\n\nOne of the reasons I don't go into politics, I don't know how to do that. That demands very, very tough skills. And, you know, like, I think it was true, and I said, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Right.\n\nSpeaker 2: So, this is the moment of heat. And if you have politicians who just have no idea what to do in this situation, step aside and let somebody else.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yuval, you're in you're in London With Rory, I'm in Paris. Before you leave, if you can, take a look at Rory mentioned Ireland. Take a look at the BBC documentary series that's they had recently called once upon a time in Northern Ireland because I think you made the point there that change can come when it feels Absolutely impossible. And I can't imagine what it's like for you, for every Israeli, for every person living in the West Bank and Gaza and Jews and Palestinians around the world, utterly, utterly horrific, but it is one of the most hopeful TV things I've ever watched. But finally from me, and thanks for giving us so much of your time, but finally from me, you mentioned there the politicians.\n\nThere's there's 3 I want to sort of get your sense and maybe also Rory's sense of how you think they're viewing this. The first is Khamenei in Iran\n\nSpeaker 2: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: And whether I'm not asking you to get inside his head, but how you think that might be going. Putin in Moscow and also Zelensky. Because I've my other fear for this is that it's going to take the world's attention away from another really difficult situation in in a way that could be very, very damaging to Ukraine. So what's your take on those 3 and how they'll be\n\nSpeaker 2: looking at this? I think Khamenei's, like, Official title is the spiritual leader of Iran. Right? Now what is spirituality? I mean, what is a spiritual leader?\n\nWhat does a spiritual leader do in a situation of this immense suffering? Let's see. What is the quality of spirituality of the Iranian spiritual leadership. I don't know. Let let's see.\n\nWith regard to Putin, I think, you know, I I can't get into the mind of of such a person, But given the horrors that he unleashed on the Ukrainian people, I don't think this person can have any kind of compassion. Maybe just rejoices as more and more of the world goes up in flame. And, also, again, diverting attention From his crimes and from the threat that he poses. Zelensky, again, I think Zelensky is besides being an inspiring Leader of Ukraine, I think is the most inspiring Jewish leader of our time. What is done in in Ukraine is absolutely amazing, Especially given, again, the very, very difficult history of Jews and Ukrainians.\n\nThe fact that Ukrainians have chosen a Jewish person To lead them at their greatest hour of need and the the way he leads them. This is absolutely anybody, you know, all these kind of very nationalistic views That you can't be both a Ukrainian and a Jew and absolute nonsense. I mean, he is showing the world what true patriotism is. And also his reaction now. You know, Israel in many ways turned a cold shoulder to Ukraine in its hour of greatest need, Being very, very careful about how it phrases itself on the conflict so as not to anger the Russians because we have our own interests to take into account And being quite stingy in the way that the the help that we, extend to Ukraine.\n\nAnd A bit like president Biden, Zelensky didn't, didn't use it to ah, you didn't do this for me, so I'll now show\n\nSpeaker 1: no. Bargain.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Like, Very, very clear. And offering to come to Israel. You know, his country is under this vicious attack. And he says, I know from my experience How important it is in your hour of desperation and pain that foreign leaders come and and be just be there with you.\n\nAnd I want to come and be there with you despite the fact that the war the terrible war is still ongoing. And, you know, Israel is not really under an existential Threat in the way that Ukraine is. Hamas cannot conquer Israel. Ukraine is still in danger of being Concorde and obliterated by the Russian army. And you Zelensky says, I I want to come and be with you.\n\nSo this is so inspiring.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, just and I suggest very quickly on your question there. I mean, I think the The terrible logic here is stepping back from Israel, Palestine for a second is just the explosion of conflict Since 2014. I mean, almost every year\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Over the last 9 years, we've had more civilian casualties, more refugees, more displaced people. We've had nearly 7 coups in in Africa in just over a year. We have the horror of Ukraine. We now have the unbelievable horror of what's happening in Israel and Palestine. I mean, there is a sense that this popular stage is also coinciding with the an age of increasing violence.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. And it's very simple. You destroy the global order, You got this order. I mean, how it can't be any simpler than that. We have had for several years now leaders, including in the UK, in the USA, That openly say, we don't want a global order anymore.\n\nWe care only about our own country. Again, you can say whatever you want about how these leaders take care of the interests of their country. What is very clear is that none of them came with an offer of how to arrange the global order. They're against the very idea of a global order. And what's the alternative to order?\n\nChaos. If you don't work, and it's hard work to build the global order, what you get is these increasing waves of We had pandemic and famine and now war, and there will be more and more of that if we do not reestablish order. And I haven't heard any suggestion from anywhere in the world for a better order than the besmirched liberal order, which is based again on a very Basic understanding that all humans share the same basic experiences, and therefore, we all share some Common interests. It's biological that pain and and despair and sadness, they are the same In Israelis and Palestinians, in Russians and Ukrainians, and this simple realization is the basis for the liberal global order. We are all humans, And we have shared experiences.\n\nWe have shared interests. And we haven't heard from all these puthines and or buns and trumps. We haven't heard any alternative idea. So what would you base a global order on if not on these shared experiences and interests and values. And if you don't have any alternative suggestion, then we need to go back And reestablish on better foundations the only offer on the table, which is the liberal global order.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Yuval, honestly, it's been yet again Great to talk to you. Thanks for your time. Thanks above all, I think, even in such a horrific time for you, your people, What you stand for, what you believe in, still able to try to articulate some of the deeper things that are going on here and why These things are not always as simple as they seem from a from a quick headline, a quick snapshot. I think your voice is really, really important in this whole debate and Power to your elbow and keeping going. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Thank you very much.",
