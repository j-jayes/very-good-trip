Hello, and welcome to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell? We're recording this episode on the hottest day of the year, but hopefully, we'll still be able to disagree fairly agreeably all the same. How are you anyway, Alastair? What What are we gonna kick off with? Well, I think we have to kick off with the heat. It is I know I mean, I'm getting really bored with talking about how hot it is, but it is bloody hot. I'm actually Sitting in a a a very, very hot and steamy office somewhere in SW 1. I also just on heat waves, Rory, I I read an extraordinary piece. As you know, I'm quite big on the mental health agenda. I know you are too. And I read a piece on the conversation by a couple of professors, one from Oxford, Lawrence Wainwright, and one from Zurich, Eileen Neumann. And it had some horrific stats about the impact of heat waves on people's mental health, including, for example, Every 1% rise in monthly average temperature leads to a 2.2% rise in mental health deaths. And the other thing is, you know, my brother had Schizophrenia is a lifetime on antipsychotics. And the other thing is antipsychotics are very dependent. Lithium is the same in in for bipolar. They're very dependent upon the on on the body temperature. One of the side effects of antipsychotics is that people it decreases your thirst, So it stops you feeling the need to drink. So it was just a fascinating sort of you know, I think we all sort of see the stuff of Yeah. You know, People frying eggs on the pavement, and are we gonna is the planet gonna dis self destruction and all that? But then you just realize that even something like mental health has this sort of, you know, Pretty stunning impact of, of of of the current heat wave. So one of the things that I've I've just been, out on the West Coast of America, and one of the reasons I'm sounding a little croaky is I think I've been traveling for something like 32 hours with 2 2 small children. I just just just basically got off my last EasyJet plane and into this conversation. But one of the things that's very striking there is that, essentially, there is now a drought stretching from Colorado to California. Mhmm. And California produces about half the fruit and vegetables in the United States. And, of course, we're seeing the same in the Horn of Africa. We're seeing the same in Italy. And I think this is probably the first time that we're really seeing very, very clearly the way that climate change It's gonna feed into economic recession and feed into problems of supply chains. I think this is the year where that's really gonna become most obvious. And also and you know what? We I don't know if you're able in your travels to catch up with the conservative leadership debate last night, but it's just extraordinary that the whole debate was On climate change, well, it wasn't really a debate about climate change. It was it was how do we best avoid having to talk about climate change. And, I mean, there is such a kind of gap, It seems to me between the world as it is and the problems that we face and the way that politics is facing up to them. And, I mean, how is it how has climate change become just another sort of issue of polarization where if you're very right wing, you basically say it doesn't really exist? So it's I think that's an extraordinary question. I mean and I think that starts in the United States. And one of the problems is the way in which right wing discourse Imitates in some strange way what happens in America. But it's also remarkable how quickly it's happened in British politics because whatever you think of David Cameron, Theresa May, and, actually, Boris Johnson. I I have basically nothing good to say about Boris Johnson, but he was at least interested in the environment. Something that it's one of the few things that he actually has consistently cared about. And it was so central to what David Cameron was trying to do was to try to lean in in his case to international development, but also into climate. And, of course, it was Theresa May who set this target, And the conservatives tried to be proud of that target recently as 2019. So it's very dramatic how quickly that's changed. And, of course, one of the big reasons it's changed, And and I was feeling this in the United States, where this is at a much more extreme level, is because what's happened with Russia, Ukraine, and the problems with People's fuel and energy bills has really made people feel the economic consequence of the Transition the energy transition in a way that they hadn't before. And I think we're just seeing the very beginning of this. I think there is now an enormous Political opportunity for politicians all over the world to campaign against environmental policies Because increasingly, ordinary people are gonna be feeling the pain in their pockets. But that but that that says to me that the politic real political leadership then is about Confronting people with those realities. And, I mean, I I thought I find this whole Kemi Badinoch thing, I find it really baffling Because I've now watched her very closely in 2 of these debates. I'll be honest, I didn't know that much about her beforehand beyond what I'd read. I cannot if there is a sort of superlative for underwhelmed, that is what she inspires in me. I see literally nothing that makes me think this person is a leader. And yet, I then look at the sort of public polls, and they say, basically, that they thought She and Liz Truss were the weakest of the 5. And then I look at the conservative home stuff and all these kind of right wing, you know, instant surveys that done. She seems to be the darling of the right. And as you said last week, Michael Gove in there running her campaign. But she really said, you know, we can't we but she basically said I mean, I'm I'm slightly, I hope I'm not over overly misrepresenting this, but she basically said we can't we can't really tackle climate change because it's going to cost people, and we've got a cost of living crisis. I mean, it's they're sort of looking at the the short term without any fixation on the on the long term is the worst sort of leadership. And and and most of the candidates we're now talking about about the ITV debate. Most of those candidates were very, very close to saying that, weren't they? Yeah. Yeah. And And that's because and that's because it's the member that's what the members think. I mean, there's a survey in The Times today. It's number 10 of the issues that they think the Tory leaders should be tackling. Not just The members, unfortunately, I think the problem is that the Russia Ukraine situation has demonstrated to people What the energy transition's gonna feel like. I I I I think I've said before, my really starkest memory of this is when I was running to be mayor of London, and A very senior member of the cab drivers union said to me, I can tell you how you're gonna win this election. And I said, oh, brilliant. How are we gonna win the election? He said, what you gotta do is you've gotta go to out of London and point out to people that Sadiq Khan's congestion charge is gonna cost them Â£65 per family per week to run their old car, and you'll win the selection. Now, obviously, I wasn't prepared to do that, but I glimpsed there Why people do this? If you really believe this is what's gonna win your election, of course, one of the things he was pointing to here, and I think this is something that we should all be more Self reflective about is that the cost of the climate transition falls very, very heavily on low income households. Because often, we're paying for it by putting levies on people's fuel bills. We're not paying for it out of general taxation. It's not It's not that the wealthy, as as should be the case with income tax, are paying higher rates of tax towards the energy transition. You're hitting the very poorest because you're taxing their cars, you're taxing their Fuel bills, you're texting them at the pub. Rory, what just on your, point about the drives in America, what did what sense did you get about because the other debate that is just not happening here, it seems to me, is the debate about future food security, which we've talked about once or twice. But with all that's going on in Ukraine and with the great The grain problems that are now being very successfully exploited by Putin, I would argue. He is deliberately now kind of creating food supply problems, famine problems in different parts of the world. What sense did you get of of of whether that is just going to become another sort of Republican, Democrat, polarized debate about, you know, it's woke to say that we're gonna, you know, run out of food if we're not careful. What what struck me in the United States is that they're in a very different position to Europe, and I'd forgotten this, that, of course, they are much more self sufficient than we are With all their problems, they you know, Britain or Finland, for example, I was talking to a Finn. I think Finland grows about 50% of its own food, Britain probably about percent. And, of course, the United States can insulate itself if it wants. It is entirely energy self sufficient if it wants to be. It's entirely food Southwestern wants to be just a very, very, very big country. Mhmm. And we're not in that situation in Europe. And I think one of the reasons why An asymmetrial. We're gonna end up with a different long term reaction to Russia, Ukraine, and almost certainly a very, very different reaction tick. To what would happen if China invaded Taiwan is that the United States is able much more confidently to say, fine. We'll build our own semiconductor chips. We'll grow our own food. We'll have our own fuel. They can become protectionists with less extreme costs than Europe can. The the they're very worried about the Semiconductor situation though. I mean, you you've got this situation where they're they're desperately trying to get they've got the Taiwanese, I think, and the Japanese on board for this Chip four thing that they're trying to get going. But they're still sort of working on the South Koreans. And I I think I'm right in saying America's only got 10% of the semiconductor production market. Chinese way ahead. Taiwan not far behind. And I hadn't quite realized until recently. Biden actually signed an executive order recently for a big review of the policy on this. I hadn't quite realized how central it is to their kind of growth strategy because of AI and quantum quantum computers and all this stuff. Allison, I mean, just just to take listeners back to the fundamentals. As we've said in the podcast before, Taiwan produces 50% of the world's semiconductor chips. But more importantly, Taiwan produces 92% of the world's advanced semiconductor chips, and we haven't nobody I mean, this is very, very weird. Nobody in the United States or Europe has actually begun to really think through the worst case scenario. So if there's a chance, We don't know what that chance is, but let's say 20, 30% chance that Xi Jinping decides that in the next 5 years, he wants to go after Taiwan. And by doing so, we end up sanctions against them, counter sanctions, and we end up cut off from those chips. The consequence is beyond imagining. The advanced semiconductor chips are obviously the things that you need to run Advanced military equipment, advanced jets, but ordinary semiconductor chips will also become in very short supply. Now the US It's gonna be in a better position again than Europe on this. I I cannot begin to tell you how bad it will be because let's say 50% of the world's semiconductor chips, Ordinary ones are suddenly removed from production. There will be a frenzy bidding war, which will make the bidding war about vaccines seem tiny. The rich countries will try to buy every last semiconductor chip in the world. And places like Africa, basically, their telephones will collapse. Yeah. Their distribution systems will collapse. So you think about everything now depends on semiconductor chips. Every supermarket, the barcode reader depends on semiconductor chips. The just in time delivery systems depend on Our vulnerability to this is extraordinary. We've created a world in which we have created an almost complete dependence on these things To run our basic life support systems. And it is hit it's hitting all of those American industries as well, which is why they're worried about it. But, again, it underlines just the sort of The paucity of the debate and the conservative party leadership. I mean, they're all having a debate about the economy, but it it's the same debate that we had with Margaret Thatcher. It's about Taxing is about cutting taxes. It's about a bit of spending here and there. None of them have anything that you could define as a strategy for growth. None of them that I can see. So, actually, yes, it's very interesting watching that debate. One of the things that I think was going on there, I don't know what what you felt about this, is that, basically, they're trying to paint Rishi Sunak as the continuity of Boris Johnson candidate. They're trying to land on him, and that's including people like Liz Truss who've been sitting in the cabinet with him for the last two and a half years. But the whole tone of that debate was to try to make Rishi defend what the government was doing. And he did a reasonable job, but the the risk is He ends up sounding like a sort of, boring status quo. Well, we've gotta be thoughtful, and he sounds like the treasury man, doesn't he? And Liz Truss is obviously channeling a radical, pseudo Thatcherite view. With the with the bow with the little bow on the first debate? Yeah. And the 1st debate, she literally dressed as missus Thatcher, which was very peculiar, like sort of Barbie doll of missus Thatcher. But but I think There will there's something going on there, which I I I don't know whether you would have picked up as much as I do as somebody who was a conservative, that what Liz Truss is saying We'll be deeply, deeply popular with many, many conservative voters. It's not that they necessarily have very detailed views on where the deficit or debt is or even very detailed views on what the drivers of inflation are. But their basic belief is that you need to deregulate, you need to cut taxes, this new need to generate growth. So what she's doing is she's presenting herself as that person, and she's presenting Rishi As the as the sort of wet consensus, no action person. Just so listeners aren't Confused by anything that may have happened since we recorded this. We have Monday evening. One of them is gonna drop out tonight. My money's on Tom Toogan out there. I think, actually, it should be, Frankly, any one of them. And we are basically digesting the fact that So bad have these debates been for the Conservative Party that the powers that be have basically pulled the plug on them and told them they can't debate anymore with any cameras there, which now that says to me, Roy, what is probably the least democratic way of choosing a prime minister anyway has now become profoundly more undemocratic when you can't even have a debate on TV. And those debates were pretty depressing. I mean, you can see why you don't want a third in a way. I mean, what new are we gonna learn? There's not much truth telling going on, is there? I mean No. When people when people were asked about Brexit, basically, nobody mentioned The Null Nunn protocol. Mhmm. That's a very very odd thing, isn't it? Oh, they they they talk about these fantasy economics figures without mentioning that the, You know, it's taken 44% out of our GDP. And I think your point about Sunak though, I think Sunak look, I'm not a fan of Rishi soon, like, at all. But I I think if of the 5 of them, he's the one who's coming over as kind of, you know, a bit of a grown up. He's trying to give some he's trying to sort of give some sort of message that's rooted in the real world. Liz Truss strikes me as somebody as you say. She's channeling Thatcher. She's speaking to even the thing about the question about the pay rise for the public sector. It was very, kind of, you know, don't be irresponsible. It was a message that they would want to hear. I think that Tom Toogan hat, I've gotta be honest, I found very disappointing. Somebody in the swimming pool yes yesterday said to me, Rory, that he was a poor man's Rory Stewart. I don't know whether you're gonna take that well or badly. Just after you told me, it's been disappointing. Well, that was you that's me say that. The other person didn't necessarily but But I think what it what they meant by that was that he was the sort of you're the guy who was coming out of nowhere, but you actually came out of nowhere and made a bit of an impact. I don't feel he's made any impact whatsoever. I I one one of the interesting things what he will have been thinking about, and and I'm fond of him, but I think he concluded that I was too outspoken and too clear. So for example, if I had been answering on Brexit, I would have said front and center. This attempt to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol is a disgrace. Yeah. And he he didn't do that. He's obviously just he's obviously decided that he needs to try it's been quite practical. He's decided he needs to win over the conservative MPs and the party members. And to do that, he's not prepared to gotten a limb on any of those things, really. He's also he and and I think the other difference in me and him, it's just narcissistic for me to think about this, but I was more on the Rishi side. I was more on the sound money side. I was trying to say that I wouldn't cut taxes. I didn't think the economy allowed us to cut taxes. In fact, I wanted to increase spending on public services. Tom has very much been going for more cuts, cuts to national insurance, cuts to fuel duty. And and that that that worries me a bit because it it, I mean, I think the the big difference they're sounding That's right. But if I was going to be unfair, I would say that the the point about missus Thatcher is that, yes, she believed very much in cutting taxes, and she believed very much in deregulation, but she also believed in sound money. She wasn't trying to do it in, at a moment where you've got a debt to GDP ratio of about a 100%. The other thing, Roy, you got to say about Margaret Thatcher is that she sort of spoke in Big bold brushstrokes. This lot has been so piddling. I mean, you know and the the fact that just so I don't get the Kemi thing. I don't really get the Penny Morton thing, to be honest. I find this whole sort of shtick of her, you know, With being a naval reservist, then there's been quite a lot of stuff about, well, is she really, and has she really served, and all this sort of stuff. And the trans debate, which I think it's just tran like, the trans issues are serious, but the way that it's just become the kind of one thing that they're Trying to every time that, Kemi Badniak speaks, it's almost like she wants to get at, or I've got to get a penny over the trans issue. And I've just found the whole thing so, so depressing. I I mean, the the idea of 1 of these 5 being prime minister as a result of this process. I mean, admittedly, they're replacing the worst prime minister in history, but it's not impossible that they'll be in pretty much the same league quite quickly with with possible exception of Sunak. So it's interesting the the tone changed too. Looking back at that 2019 debate where we had the same number of people up. So 2019, it was Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, me, Sajid Javid. One big change, of course, is it's gone from being a bunch of, I would guess overconfident white men, except for Sajid, to a much more diverse group, but also the nature of the debate has changed. If you watch those 2 debates, You realize that, I guess, Michael Gove, love him or hate him, is a incredibly hyperarticulate speaker. You know, every one of his 1 minute, 1 and a half minute interventions were very, very carefully crafted, full of little jokes and references. These debates feel much less, energetic. Probably less aggressive. I mean, that that there it doesn't have that kind of energy going on. Well, last night was aggressive between Sunak and Truss in particular. I I felt very little love lost there. But, also, it's the way they when they get their minute, Rishi suddenly goes into a sort of, I'm going to push my hands out in front, and I'm going to I'm going to really be at a jetty. I would look straight at the camera. Liz Truss has the most bizarre Hand movement. So the the hands sort of move they can't move separate from each other. Badnock, she sort of this this this thing about, you know, she couldn't get tooth mended for god knows how long it was. It used to say, this isn't real. This isn't real. She's constantly talking about flipping burgers, and that's, you know, forget overlooking the fact that she worked to one of the richest banks in the world and all this stuff. They've all just got their little stories. Tom, if Tom's if Tom took it out and says, 1 more time, we need a Clean start. We need a clean break, a fresh start. And did you know he'd been in the military, Rory? He'd been in the military, you know? Oh my god. Has he been in the military? Honestly, it's just awful. So so there's something going on there, isn't it? There's something about back stories. I'd like to see a forward story. Yeah. Well, look look at the, anyone on Twitter, look at Rosie Holt's amazing spoof campaign video, which I just think is just beautiful. She She begins sort of blinking into the camera saying, I'm here on this housing state where my grandmother was born. She was a working class lass, And she had her struggles, and then she married my grandfather. And then she shows a picture of this incredible upper class guy, the monoclonal. The monoclonal. Yeah. And then then she says, and I'm sure he had his struggles too. You know, Rosie Oates, she gets loads of people abusing her because they really think she is a Tory MP. It's so close to it, isn't it? She's got the tone. So so right, hasn't she? And did you see as well the other thing? So the the the this thing about how these People who are barely known by the public and barely known a lot of them by the the membership. So somebody put out did a survey asking Whether people the the conservative members, whether they felt they knew a lot, they knew a good deal about the the candidate the contestants. And 3 of them, I think it was Touganhat, Badnock, and might have been Morden. Can't remember. Oh, no. No. It was one of the ones who was Braverman. Beg your pardon. Swaddler Braverman before she pulled out. They were on 5%. 5% of members thought that they knew a reasonable amount about these people. Somebody called Chris Stewart, No relation, Rory. And the reason there's no relation is because the name was invented. There is no MP of that name. There is no contestant of that name, but he was on 6%. That's that's good. That's good. I pollsters should invent invent people more. That's very good. It's a good way of getting it there, isn't it? Listen. Let's just just to round off this Question on on the conservative. So I think the next stage, obviously, I think everybody presumed is beginning to sense this, is Beginning to become a standoff between Rishi Sunak on the one side and a more right wing candidate on the other. I think it's gonna be Liz Truss. I thought her performance I mean, I you know, I'm not a not a fan, but I thought her performance on Sunday was much stronger than it had been in the previous debate. She she I I believed her. I I disagree with her, but I recognized in the way that she was speaking the kind of person that I worked with in government. And she somehow found atone to say things that she clearly believes in. And I think she does believe in cutting taxes, and I'm sure she will cut taxes, and she will deliver in that way. Yeah. So I think she is she managed in that debate on Sunday night to make herself look like the key stand of error against Rishi. Do you agree? I think I think she was certainly stronger than she was in the 1st debate, and she was speaking absolutely directly to the electorate. She was speaking to the members. Every every little sort of The drum that she was beating was aimed at them rather than the public. I don't think she cares about the fact that the public don't like her very much. I thought Penny Morton was weak on both the debates. I think she just comes over as a bit kind of not standing for very much. I think she's trying to sort of be too clever by half in in saying this is not the place to say what we want to do and set up budgets and so forth. And so I I think it is coming down to Sunak against Truss, And I I you know that you know the Tory party membership better than I do, but I think there is a very strong any anybody but Sunak thing going on. So just to finish on this because, and to pay a bit of a tribute to Tom Teigenhardt because I think he is the guy who Deserves huge credit for standing up against Boris Johnson, for not being a minister in his government. I think he's been a really impressive he's he's made something of being chair of the foreign affairs select committee. I mean, one of my experiences I I wouldn't disagree with that. I I don't think he's been very good as a campaigner in this election. He was quite in the in the 1st debate, I guess. He had a certain kind of presence and confidence in the 1st debate. Yeah. I think I think he got a bit smug in the second one, and I think he's I think he got too fond of his little one liners. I don't know. I just it it it struck me as it It just felt like it was all a bit of a game, the whole thing. I I could be completely wrong, and I may be maligning him unnecessarily, but I I I wasn't impressed in the 2nd debate. Should we take a break, Roy? We talked enough about these people. Yeah. Let's take a break. Welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And you're doing very well, Rory, considering that you've been traveling for god knows how along with 2 small children. Will you be pleased here, I'm I'm eating a shortbread biscuit to try to keep me going? True Scottish thing. So while I while I eat my biscuit, Alisa, Can can give us give us some thoughts on the world. Thoughts on the world. First of all, just let's just stick with, you you were talking about Taiwan, and during the break, I was I was looking at an email. And I think this we can we can see this as kind of live journalism. Dear mister Campbell and team, I think that means you, Roy. I think you're now seen as my team. I'm a journalist at Commonwealth Magazine known in Taiwan for its in-depth reporting. We're currently working on a short documentary about how the global trend Towards populism has manifested itself in Taiwan, both in the failed KMT leadership contender Han Kuo yu and certain elements of the incumbent Democratic People's Party. Inspired partly, they're reading the right books, by Moises Naeem's recent book, The Revenge of Power about which, as you know, I'm obsessed. We're looking to make this a comparative piece and situate tie Taiwanese populism in its proper global context. And therefore, Rory, he goes on, as an avid listener of your podcast, I know that you both have excellent expertise and relevant first experience for the rise and fall of Boris Johnson. Not only this, but it's clear you have a keen interest in Taiwan and the Taiwan China issue. We would be honored if you could join us for a short interview to share some of your insight into these issues. So look, Rory, why don't we use this as the press office function? We don't have time to do the interview, but Rory is now gonna give you a few words about populism in Taiwan. Go. Okay. Well, here we go. So firstly, for for listeners who've who've, haven't been following acedurist every second, as Moses Naeem, who is Alastair Campbell's, great hero at the moment comes up with 3 p's, which Alastair will remind us are populism Polarization. Truth, and post truth. Yep. Populism, polarization, and post truth. And, Actually, this is really becoming a very interesting framing. I I saw the president of Colombia recently, And that was the current president who's just come at the end about being replaced by a left wing populist. And that was absolutely what he said to me. He said, the one thing you need to understand about Latin America, He didn't credit Moses Naim or Alastair Campbell, but he produced the 3 p's, populism, polarization, post truth. And I think that The there's what's happening in Taiwan is simply must be part of a much, much bigger global phenomenon because it's obviously no coincidence It happens in Brazil and India and Poland and in its own way in Britain and in Trump's America and right up and down Latin America. And by the way, Imran Khan had his his party had Bit of a a big electoral success this week. There was a big regional election, which he did really well in. Yeah. We've been warning about, haven't we, on the podcast? So it's one of the things we're talking about. But people think that You can simply get rid of these guys, and they go away. And this is one of the things that I'm slightly neurotic about with Boris Johnson. You you you think, and I think this is a the best case scenario that he's gonna go off and just try to make some money giving speeches and writing an a useless book on win William Shakespeare. But I I think, I I almost said Winston Shakespeare. That's putting his 2 books together, isn't it? But I think there's a risk, actually, for him as for all these characters that they try to fall back on a particular base that believes they've been wrongly treated. You can see him Ethan and his his speech today we're speaking today on Monday evening where he's just given this big barnstorming speech in the city. I didn't see it. Did you watch it? Is it? I caught bits of it. I mean, it's it's it's it's, It's him in his full barnstorming kind of rhetorical behavior. And I think what is interesting is that, obviously, we we all see on television people being interviewed, and we meet people. I just met someone in Cumbria who very much felt that Boris Johnson being badly treated, and he'd been betrayed by his MPs, and he was their guy. And I am very worried that he may try to feed off that narrative, And he may try to have that his competitiveness may drive him to try to come back into British politics and the way that Donald Trump and Imran Khan do. He may he may even fancy, a new a new party, which would be quite good. It'd be good if it was the right that split with all these parties rather than the progressive left. But I I I also do do you think, Roy, that is the the people will, however, be so lastly, in the TV debate or the ITV debate, Juliette Atchiam asked them all to put raise their hand if they would put Boris Johnson into their cabinet, not one of them would. Now there will be people who are saying that's just disloyal and etcetera, But what does it say about this point? They also she asked them whether they would call a general election, and they all said no. But they're basically running on a ticket It says, we've had a terrible government and a terrible prime minister, and I'm gonna change it all, but I don't think I should put myself before the British people. It should only be decided by these aging Tory party members. That's true. Although, as we said, I think, in last week's episode, it is re remarkable that it's the exception rather than the rule of people actually coming in under a general election. Remember, Gordon Brown came in in the same situation. Gordon Brown's taking over for Tony Blair. Same thing. Yeah. Well, I think he's midway through. Yeah. He did come midway through, but he came through with Tony Blair's support. This lot are all now distancing themselves from the guy that very recently. They were sitting around the cabinet table laughing at all his jokes and saying that everything he did was wonderful. So listen, just briefly, you you've been in the States. What what's your What's your sense on, where we are in US politics at the moment? So one one, I think, one statistic that's very interesting, Support for Trump abunks Republicans few months ago was 90%. Shocking that 90% of Republican voters supported Trump. It's now down to 60%, but that's still a very, very big number. Do you think this is because of the hearings, which have been pretty horrific for him, I think? They have been unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. He, being the narcissist he is, is, now saying trying to disrupt the midterms by, threatening to announce that he's gonna run as president, which we've actually damaging for the Republicans. So they're begging him not to, and he's trying to What he essentially does is he sits in Florida, as we know, watching television. And, his price, for not saying that he's gonna run again before the midterms is to have all these candidates out there saying nice things about him on television. So he keeps sending them texts saying, You weren't nice about enough about me on telly. Maybe I'm gonna go out and announce that I'm gonna run again before the midterms, and then they so, essentially, yeah, he sits there eating burgers watching Fox News Mhmm. Wants everybody to get out there and defend him for privacy. Terrific. Fox News has been a really malign influence on the planet, I would say. Yep. I I'm with you on that. Okay. Now here's here's here's the the the big thing that I came with. I now think that we are going Into a 19 seventies style global recession. In other words, a decade of lost growth. Mhmm. And And I and I think a lot of things are coming together. One one of the things is something we talked about, which is the heat wave. Because, actually, climate change is going to cause big, big problems on supply of food. I think the security crisis, obviously, in Ukraine, is driving up the cost of fuel. The And food. Security tension and food. Security tensions with China will drive more and more people to try to onshore. There's gonna be more and more protectionism as they disentangle the global economy. And, of course, The reason we haven't had any inflation 40 years is a large part not to do with the genius of the Bank of England, which is what was saying. But But it's a great deal to do with the fact that China has been producing incredibly cheap goods. China has basically kept inflation under control. Add to that demographics. Our populations are getting older. Add to that, we're less and less keen on immigration, so we're not bringing in enough young, talented people. So rising cost of production, climate change, older population, not enough young immigrants coming in. And add to that, I think that we're gonna go into a world of cyber warfare. And finally Rory, you you you you you I I talked earlier about the heat wave having a deleterious effect on my mental health and the other mental. This is not helping. I'm gonna come I'm gonna come on to did you see the the latest growth figures from China were an absolute Car crash naught 0.4% in the Q2, which is the lowest since records began in 1992 apart from the 6.9% and traction at the start of COVID. And and a lot of that and they're still doing the COVID zero COVID, strategy. They still got this massive property slump. Shanghai GDP is down 13.7% year on year. It's unbelievable. And the 5 they've got a 5.5% growth target, which they now reckon is, impossible. And, of course, the only way in which they have been achieving it is by extraordinary weird bits of financial management, weird bits of debt. I mean, and and I've one one of the things that I think none of these candidates are grappling with and no politicians really grappling with I mean, I saw I saw quite distinguished democratic Congressman, in the states, yesterday, they are absolutely You love you love the distinguished adjective, don't you? You love the distinguished. Why? I keep referring to being on the podcast with this distinguished former communications director. No. You don't. That's why. Anyway, yeah, tell me what the distinguished Does does it sound better in French? Can I say distinguished? Does that sound better in French? Distinguay. No. It doesn't really. It doesn't. No. No. No. It sounds elitist. Sadly, it's a good idea. This distinguished congressman said. Okay. So distinguished congressman said is, of course, their biggest issue is inflation, cost of living. And he says they have to own it, but the problem is how on earth do they own it if they don't have a solution to it? So owning it means, at the moment, trying to blame Russia and Ukraine for the cost of living crisis. But all that will do is that will create Huge opportunities for any entrepreneurial politician to say, well, in which case, we should let Putin have that bit of Ukraine if it's causing this economic crisis. Just in the same way as I was saying, Any entrepreneurial politician will take advantage of the costs of trying to do climate transition. Mhmm. What was your sense in the States? There's there's there's a lot of kind of commentary around Europe, I would say. And I've seen a little bit in America, but you'll have been closer to it. The the idea that Putin is sort of quite happy with where things are at the moment. I think that the Americans, the American national security establishment, remain very Convinced that if they can get enough weapons and the right kind of high quality weapons to Ukraine, Ukraine can push back hard. Now that may just be that the generals are constitutionally incapable of not being optimistic. So their optimistic story is that Ukraine is better at mobilizing manpower, and it's got better equipment. And the sanctions are beginning to hit Russia. Their high-tech equipment can't be maintained or replaced. The United States, it the amount they've shipped in there is beyond imagining. People now estimate that they've provided $50,000,000,000 worth of assistance to Ukraine. But hold on. I thought I thought Liz Truss was single handedly facing down Vladimir Putin. I'm I'm shocked that the Americans are also involved. It's it's it's extraordinary, isn't it? Whenever you go to the United States, you suddenly discover that, having believed that Britain was doing everything on its own, that somehow the Americans are spending 10 times as much as we are, and they hadn't really noticed that we were Doing quite as much. But the the, no, the $50,000,000,000 is it's only $50,000,000,000 would be enough in direct cash transfers to lift About half the population of Africa are out of extreme poverty this year. Yeah. I mean, that is a lot of money. Oh, no. Listen. I I don't think Joe Biden gets nearly enough credit for what he's been trying to do. He had a very tricky trip to the Middle East. Yeah. And there was you know, we talk about the way that the world has changed to for for an American president to go to the Middle East and Israel Palestine question. Yes. He addressed it to some extent, but it was so far down the agenda. His big thing was actually trying to repair some sort of relationship with the Saudis, in order to try and drive down the price of fuel. I mean, we're back to the cost of living. And and this and it's really difficult, isn't it? Because we, since the early nineties, have had a vision that we can, build a The coalition of democracies, and, of course, we failed to do that. What we've got is a situation in which if the world is getting into great power confrontation. Many of the allies that we need are not democracies, and that's gonna be very uncomfortable. Mhmm. Mhmm. And it it also is is I think the other thing that The United States is deeply critically aware of at the moment is that they fear they're losing legitimacy, that the world increasingly sees them As hypocrites, I mean, it's been very, very traumatic for the Biden administration to see how brutal Pakistan has been in its refusal to join on well, I think Somebody produced a statistic that 8 out of 10 of the most populous countries in the world refused to back the United States Yeah. Absolutely. We we we kid ourselves that the world is united against Russia. It just hasn't happened. I was at, Sandhurst Military Academy this week, Rory with the Army Leadership Center. I'm sure they'd welcome you there as well. And I was I was, reading later the the latest iteration of the of the army leadership doctrine, and it's very heavy on values, standards, ethics, and integrity. Now I was very careful not to be too political down there. I'm well aware that you can't really do that when you're with the military, But they had a the this document had a wonderful page on what it called toxic leadership, which is it you find in this way. Autocratic, narcissistic, manipulative, intimidating, overly competitive, and discriminating. I am recommending that this book is read by whoever becomes the next prime minister. But and I I'm with you. I mean, I think and this is one of the reasons why it's been the soldiers, Wyatt's been Tom Teigenhardt and Tobias Elwood and Johnny Mercer who were quite quick to call out Boris Johnson. Mhmm. I mean, they particularly are incredibly sensitive to this and are most likely to be disgusted by this stuff because it's absolutely driven into people that you follow leaders who you admire for their integrity and their honor, and you don't follow people that you think are Yeah. But listen, we we we should we should we try Close with a few questions. Francesco Roman. Francesco Papalia. I like this one because she takes you to task over something. What do you make of Draghi's attempt at a resignation last week, and what's your more general opinions on Italian politics? And, Rory, it's Lake Como, not Cuomo, there is no u after the c. Okay? That's really good. I I I somehow I think I got the governor of governor of New York in there, didn't I? That's What's going on there? Yeah. So late COBRA. Yeah. But it was fascinating. There's old Draghi. He gets, no pun intended, dragged in to be prime minister of a sort of, you know, a kind of managerial, technocratic government. He does a pretty good job. Italy's reputation seems to be growing, And then he has this because we're back to the thing about the populous virus, the 5 star movement. They they they won't support him on a major part the thing that he's trying to do, And he goes to the president and says, I'm residing. The president says, no. You're not. That's extraordinary, isn't it? It's no. It's it's it's mesmerizing. Well, thank you all so much for listening, and we've got a very special guest coming in. So we're gonna who we find out more about shortly. So we're gonna finish this episode, but thank you so much. It's goodbye from me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. See you soon.",

How are you anyway, Alastair? What What are we gonna kick off with?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think we have to kick off with the heat. It is I know I mean, I'm getting really bored with talking about how hot it is, but it is bloody hot. I'm actually Sitting in a a a very, very hot and steamy office somewhere in SW 1. I also just on heat waves, Rory, I I read an extraordinary piece. As you know, I'm quite big on the mental health agenda.\n\nI know you are too. And I read a piece on the conversation by a couple of professors, one from Oxford, Lawrence Wainwright, and one from Zurich, Eileen Neumann. And it had some horrific stats about the impact of heat waves on people's mental health, including, for example, Every 1% rise in monthly average temperature leads to a 2.2% rise in mental health deaths. And the other thing is, you know, my brother had Schizophrenia\n\nSpeaker 1: is a\n\nSpeaker 0: lifetime on antipsychotics. And the other thing is antipsychotics are very dependent. Lithium is the same in in for bipolar. They're very dependent upon the on on the body temperature. One of the side effects of antipsychotics is that people it decreases your thirst, So it stops you feeling the need to drink.\n\nSo it was just a fascinating sort of you know, I think we all sort of see the stuff of\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. You\n\nSpeaker 0: know, People frying eggs on the pavement, and are we gonna is the planet gonna dis self destruction and all that? But then you just realize that even something like mental health has this sort of, you know, Pretty stunning impact of, of of of the current heat wave.\n\nSpeaker 1: So one of the things that I've I've just been, out on the West Coast of America, and one of the reasons I'm sounding a little croaky is I think I've been traveling for something like 32 hours with 2 2 small children. I just just just basically got off my last EasyJet plane and into this conversation. But one of the things that's very striking there is that, essentially, there is now a drought stretching from Colorado to California. Mhmm. And California produces about half the fruit and vegetables in the United States.\n\nAnd, of course, we're seeing the same in the Horn of Africa. We're seeing the same in Italy. And I think this is probably the first time that we're really seeing very, very clearly the way that climate change It's gonna feed into economic recession and feed into problems of supply chains. I think this is the year where that's really gonna become most obvious.\n\nSpeaker 0: And also and you know what? We I don't know if you're able in your travels to catch up with the conservative leadership debate last night, but it's just extraordinary that the whole debate was On climate change, well, it wasn't really a debate about climate change. It was it was how do we best avoid having to talk about climate change. And, I mean, there is such a kind of gap, It seems to me between the world as it is and the problems that we face and the way that politics is facing up to them. And, I mean, how is it how has climate change become just another sort of issue of polarization where if you're very right wing, you basically say it doesn't really exist?\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's I think that's an extraordinary question. I mean and I think that starts in the United States. And one of the problems is the way in which right wing discourse Imitates in some strange way what happens in America. But it's also remarkable how quickly it's happened in British politics because whatever you think of David Cameron, Theresa May, and, actually, Boris Johnson. I I have basically nothing good to say about Boris Johnson, but he was at least interested in the environment.\n\nSomething that it's one of the few things that he actually has consistently cared about. And it was so central to what David Cameron was trying to do was to try to lean in in his case to international development, but also into climate. And, of course, it was Theresa May who set this target, And the conservatives tried to be proud of that target recently as 2019. So it's very dramatic how quickly that's changed. And, of course, one of the big reasons it's changed, And and I was feeling this in the United States, where this is at a much more extreme level, is because what's happened with Russia, Ukraine, and the problems with People's fuel and energy bills has really made people feel the economic consequence of the Transition the energy transition in a way that they hadn't before.\n\nAnd I think we're just seeing the very beginning of this. I think there is now an enormous Political opportunity for politicians all over the world to campaign against environmental policies Because increasingly, ordinary people are gonna be feeling the pain in their pockets.\n\nSpeaker 0: But that but that that says to me that the politic real political leadership then is about Confronting people with those realities. And, I mean, I I thought I find this whole Kemi Badinoch thing, I find it really baffling Because I've now watched her very closely in 2 of these debates. I'll be honest, I didn't know that much about her beforehand beyond what I'd read. I cannot if there is a sort of superlative for underwhelmed, that is what she inspires in me. I see literally nothing that makes me think this person is a leader.\n\nAnd yet, I then look at the sort of public polls, and they say, basically, that they thought She and Liz Truss were the weakest of the 5. And then I look at the conservative home stuff and all these kind of right wing, you know, instant surveys that done. She seems to be the darling of the right. And as you said last week, Michael Gove in there running her campaign. But she really said, you know, we can't we but she basically said I mean, I'm I'm slightly, I hope I'm not over overly misrepresenting this, but she basically said we can't we can't really tackle climate change because it's going to cost people, and we've got a cost of living crisis.\n\nI mean, it's they're sort of looking at the the short term without any fixation on the on the long term is the worst sort of leadership.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and and most of the candidates we're now talking about about the ITV debate. Most of those candidates were very, very close to saying that, weren't they?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. And And that's because and that's because it's the member that's what the members think. I mean, there's a survey in The Times today. It's number 10 of the issues that they think the Tory leaders should be tackling.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not just The members, unfortunately, I think the problem is that the Russia Ukraine situation has demonstrated to people What the energy transition's gonna feel like. I I I I think I've said before, my really starkest memory of this is when I was running to be mayor of London, and A very senior member of the cab drivers union said to me, I can tell you how you're gonna win this election. And I said, oh, brilliant. How are we gonna win the election? He said, what you gotta do is you've gotta go to out of London and point out to people that Sadiq Khan's congestion charge is gonna cost them Â£65 per family per week to run their old car, and you'll win the selection.\n\nNow, obviously, I wasn't prepared to do that, but I glimpsed there Why people do this? If you really believe this is what's gonna win your election, of course, one of the things he was pointing to here, and I think this is something that we should all be more Self reflective about is that the cost of the climate transition falls very, very heavily on low income households. Because often, we're paying for it by putting levies on people's fuel bills. We're not paying for it out of general taxation. It's not\n\nSpeaker 0: It's\n\nSpeaker 1: not that the wealthy, as as should be the case with income tax, are paying higher rates of tax towards the energy transition. You're hitting the very poorest because you're taxing their cars, you're taxing their Fuel bills, you're texting them at the pub.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory, what just on your, point about the drives in America, what did what sense did you get about because the other debate that is just not happening here, it seems to me, is the debate about future food security, which we've talked about once or twice. But with all that's going on in Ukraine and with the great The grain problems that are now being very successfully exploited by Putin, I would argue. He is deliberately now kind of creating food supply problems, famine problems in different parts of the world. What sense did you get of of of whether that is just going to become another sort of Republican, Democrat, polarized debate about, you know, it's woke to say that we're gonna, you know, run out of food if we're not careful.\n\nSpeaker 1: What what struck me in the United States is that they're in a very different position to Europe, and I'd forgotten this, that, of course, they are much more self sufficient than we are With all their problems, they you know, Britain or Finland, for example, I was talking to a Finn. I think Finland grows about 50% of its own food, Britain probably about percent. And, of course, the United States can insulate itself if it wants. It is entirely energy self sufficient if it wants to be. It's entirely food Southwestern wants to be just a very, very, very big country.\n\nMhmm. And we're not in that situation in Europe. And I think one of the reasons why An asymmetrial. We're gonna end up with a different long term reaction to Russia, Ukraine, and almost certainly a very, very different reaction tick. To what would happen if China invaded Taiwan is that the United States is able much more confidently to say, fine.\n\nWe'll build our own semiconductor chips. We'll grow our own food. We'll have our own fuel. They can become protectionists with less extreme costs than Europe can.\n\nSpeaker 0: The the they're very worried about the Semiconductor situation though. I mean, you you've got this situation where they're they're desperately trying to get they've got the Taiwanese, I think, and the Japanese on board for this Chip four thing that they're trying to get going. But they're still sort of working on the South Koreans. And I I think I'm right in saying America's only got 10% of the semiconductor production market. Chinese way ahead.\n\nTaiwan not far behind. And I hadn't quite realized until recently. Biden actually signed an executive order recently for a big review of the policy on this. I hadn't quite realized how central it is to their kind of growth strategy because of AI and quantum quantum computers and all this stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Allison, I mean, just just to take listeners back to the fundamentals. As we've said in the podcast before, Taiwan produces 50% of the world's semiconductor chips. But more importantly, Taiwan produces 92% of the world's advanced semiconductor chips, and we haven't nobody I mean, this is very, very weird. Nobody in the United States or Europe has actually begun to really think through the worst case scenario. So if there's a chance, We don't know what that chance is, but let's say 20, 30% chance that Xi Jinping decides that in the next 5 years, he wants to go after Taiwan.\n\nAnd by doing so, we end up sanctions against them, counter sanctions, and we end up cut off from those chips. The consequence is beyond imagining. The advanced semiconductor chips are obviously the things that you need to run Advanced military equipment, advanced jets, but ordinary semiconductor chips will also become in very short supply. Now the US It's gonna be in a better position again than Europe on this. I I cannot begin to tell you how bad it will be because let's say 50% of the world's semiconductor chips, Ordinary ones are suddenly removed from production.\n\nThere will be a frenzy bidding war, which will make the bidding war about vaccines seem tiny. The rich countries will try to buy every last semiconductor chip in the world. And places like Africa, basically, their telephones will collapse. Yeah. Their distribution systems will collapse.\n\nSo you think about everything now depends on semiconductor chips. Every supermarket, the barcode reader depends on semiconductor chips. The just in time delivery systems depend on Our vulnerability to this is extraordinary. We've created a world in which we have created an almost complete dependence on these things To run our basic life support systems.\n\nSpeaker 0: And it is hit it's hitting all of those American industries as well, which is why they're worried about it. But, again, it underlines just the sort of The paucity of the debate and the conservative party leadership. I mean, they're all having a debate about the economy, but it it's the same debate that we had with Margaret Thatcher. It's about Taxing is about cutting taxes. It's about a bit of spending here and there.\n\nNone of them have anything that you could define as a strategy for growth. None of them that I can see.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, actually, yes, it's very interesting watching that debate. One of the things that I think was going on there, I don't know what what you felt about this, is that, basically, they're trying to paint Rishi Sunak as the continuity of Boris Johnson candidate. They're trying to land on him, and that's including people like Liz Truss who've been sitting in the cabinet with him for the last two and a half years. But the whole tone of that debate was to try to make Rishi defend what the government was doing. And he did a reasonable job, but the the risk is He ends up sounding like a sort of, boring status quo.\n\nWell, we've gotta be thoughtful, and he sounds like the treasury man, doesn't he? And Liz Truss is obviously channeling a radical, pseudo Thatcherite view.\n\nSpeaker 0: With the with the bow with the little bow on the first debate?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And the 1st debate, she literally dressed as missus Thatcher, which was very peculiar, like sort of Barbie doll of missus Thatcher. But but I think There will there's something going on there, which I I I don't know whether you would have picked up as much as I do as somebody who was a conservative, that what Liz Truss is saying We'll be deeply, deeply popular with many, many conservative voters. It's not that they necessarily have very detailed views on where the deficit or debt is or even very detailed views on what the drivers of inflation are. But their basic belief is that you need to deregulate, you need to cut taxes, this new need to generate growth.\n\nSo what she's doing is she's presenting herself as that person, and she's presenting Rishi As the as the sort of wet consensus, no action person.\n\nSpeaker 0: Just so listeners aren't Confused by anything that may have happened since we recorded this. We have Monday evening. One of them is gonna drop out tonight. My money's on Tom Toogan out there. I think, actually, it should be, Frankly, any one of them.\n\nAnd we are basically digesting the fact that So bad have these debates been for the Conservative Party that the powers that be have basically pulled the plug on them and told them they can't debate anymore with any cameras there, which now that says to me, Roy, what is probably the least democratic way of choosing a prime minister anyway has now become profoundly more undemocratic when you can't even have a debate on TV.\n\nSpeaker 1: And those debates were pretty depressing. I mean, you can see why you don't want a third in a way. I mean, what new are we gonna learn? There's not much truth telling going on, is there? I mean No.\n\nWhen people when people were asked about Brexit, basically, nobody mentioned The Null Nunn protocol. Mhmm. That's a very very odd thing, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, they they they talk about these fantasy economics figures without mentioning that the, You know, it's taken 44% out of our GDP. And I think your point about Sunak though, I think Sunak look, I'm not a fan of Rishi soon, like, at all. But I I think if of the 5 of them, he's the one who's coming over as kind of, you know, a bit of a grown up. He's trying to give some he's trying to sort of give some sort of message that's rooted in the real world. Liz Truss strikes me as somebody as you say.\n\nShe's channeling Thatcher. She's speaking to even the thing about the question about the pay rise for the public sector. It was very, kind of, you know, don't be irresponsible. It was a message that they would want to hear. I think that Tom Toogan hat, I've gotta be honest, I found very disappointing.\n\nSomebody in the swimming pool yes yesterday said to me, Rory, that he was a poor man's Rory Stewart. I don't know whether you're gonna take that well or badly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just after you told me, it's been disappointing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that was you that's me say that. The other person didn't necessarily but But I think what it what they meant by that was that he was the sort of you're the guy who was coming out of nowhere, but you actually came out of nowhere and made a bit of an impact. I don't feel he's made any impact whatsoever.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I one one of the interesting things what he will have been thinking about, and and I'm fond of him, but I think he concluded that I was too outspoken and too clear. So for example, if I had been answering on Brexit, I would have said front and center. This attempt to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol is a disgrace. Yeah. And he he didn't do that.\n\nHe's obviously just he's obviously decided that he needs to try it's been quite practical. He's decided he needs to win over the conservative MPs and the party members. And to do that, he's not prepared to gotten a limb on any of those things, really. He's also he and and I think the other difference in me and him, it's just narcissistic for me to think about this, but I was more on the Rishi side. I was more on the sound money side.\n\nI was trying to say that I wouldn't cut taxes. I didn't think the economy allowed us to cut taxes. In fact, I wanted to increase spending on public services. Tom has very much been going for more cuts, cuts to national insurance, cuts to fuel duty. And and that that that worries me a bit because it it, I mean, I think the the big difference they're sounding That's right.\n\nBut if I was going to be unfair, I would say that the the point about missus Thatcher is that, yes, she believed very much in cutting taxes, and she believed very much in deregulation, but she also believed in sound money. She wasn't trying to do it in, at a moment where you've got a debt to GDP ratio of about a 100%.\n\nSpeaker 0: The other thing, Roy, you got to say about Margaret Thatcher is that she sort of spoke in Big bold brushstrokes. This lot has been so piddling. I mean, you know and the the fact that just so I don't get the Kemi thing. I don't really get the Penny Morton thing, to be honest. I find this whole sort of shtick of her, you know, With being a naval reservist, then there's been quite a lot of stuff about, well, is she really, and has she really served, and all this sort of stuff.\n\nAnd the trans debate, which I think it's just tran like, the trans issues are serious, but the way that it's just become the kind of one thing that they're Trying to every time that, Kemi Badniak speaks, it's almost like she wants to get at, or I've got to get a penny over the trans issue. And I've just found the whole thing so, so depressing. I I mean, the the idea of 1 of these 5 being prime minister as a result of this process. I mean, admittedly, they're replacing the worst prime minister in history, but it's not impossible that they'll be in pretty much the same league quite quickly with with possible exception of Sunak.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's interesting the the tone changed too. Looking back at that 2019 debate where we had the same number of people up. So 2019, it was Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Jeremy Hunt, me, Sajid Javid. One big change, of course, is it's gone from being a bunch of, I would guess overconfident white men, except for Sajid, to a much more diverse group, but also the nature of the debate has changed. If you watch those 2 debates, You realize that, I guess, Michael Gove, love him or hate him, is a incredibly hyperarticulate speaker.\n\nYou know, every one of his 1 minute, 1 and a half minute interventions were very, very carefully crafted, full of little jokes and references. These debates feel much less, energetic. Probably less aggressive. I mean, that that there it doesn't have that kind of energy going on.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, last night was aggressive between Sunak and Truss in particular. I I felt very little love lost there. But, also, it's the way they when they get their minute, Rishi suddenly goes into a sort of, I'm going to push my hands out in front, and I'm going to I'm going to really be at a jetty. I would look straight at the camera. Liz Truss has the most bizarre Hand movement.\n\nSo the the hands sort of move they can't move separate from each other. Badnock, she sort of this this this thing about, you know, she couldn't get tooth mended for god knows how long it was. It used to say, this isn't real. This isn't real. She's constantly talking about flipping burgers, and that's, you know, forget overlooking the fact that she worked to one of the richest banks in the world and all this stuff.\n\nThey've all just got their little stories. Tom, if Tom's if Tom took it out and says, 1 more time, we need a Clean start. We need a clean break, a fresh start. And did you know he'd been in the military, Rory? He'd been in the military, you know?\n\nOh my god. Has he been in the military? Honestly, it's just awful.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so there's something going on there, isn't it? There's something about back stories.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'd like to see a forward story.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, look look at the, anyone on Twitter, look at Rosie Holt's amazing spoof campaign video, which I just think is just beautiful. She She begins sort of blinking into the camera saying, I'm here on this housing state where my grandmother was born. She was a working class lass, And she had her struggles, and then she married my grandfather. And then she shows a picture of this incredible upper class guy, the monoclonal.\n\nSpeaker 0: The monoclonal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And then then she says, and I'm sure he had his struggles\n\nSpeaker 0: too. You know, Rosie Oates, she gets loads of people abusing her because they really think she is a Tory MP.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's so close to it, isn't it? She's got the tone. So so right, hasn't\n\nSpeaker 0: she? And did you see as well the other thing? So the the the this thing about how these People who are barely known by the public and barely known a lot of them by the the membership. So somebody put out did a survey asking Whether people the the conservative members, whether they felt they knew a lot, they knew a good deal about the the candidate the contestants. And 3 of them, I think it was Touganhat, Badnock, and might have been Morden.\n\nCan't remember. Oh, no. No. It was one of the ones who was Braverman. Beg your pardon.\n\nSwaddler Braverman before she pulled out. They were on 5%. 5% of members thought that they knew a reasonable amount about these people. Somebody called Chris Stewart, No relation, Rory. And the reason there's no relation is because the name was invented.\n\nThere is no MP of that name. There is no contestant of that name, but he was on 6%.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's that's good. That's good. I pollsters should invent invent people more. That's very good. It's a good way of getting it there, isn't it?\n\nListen. Let's just just to round off this Question on on the conservative. So I think the next stage, obviously, I think everybody presumed is beginning to sense this, is Beginning to become a standoff between Rishi Sunak on the one side and a more right wing candidate on the other.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think it's gonna be Liz Truss.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought her performance I mean, I you know, I'm not a not a fan, but I thought her performance on Sunday was much stronger than it had been in the previous debate. She she I I believed her. I I disagree with her, but I recognized in the way that she was speaking the kind of person that I worked with in government. And she somehow found atone to say things that she clearly believes in. And I think she does believe in cutting taxes, and I'm sure she will cut taxes, and she will deliver in that way.\n\nYeah. So I think she is she managed in that debate on Sunday night to make herself look like the key stand of error against Rishi. Do you agree?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think I think she was certainly stronger than she was in the 1st debate, and she was speaking absolutely directly to the electorate. She was speaking to the members. Every every little sort of The drum that she was beating was aimed at them rather than the public. I don't think she cares about the fact that the public don't like her very much. I thought Penny Morton was weak on both the debates.\n\nI think she just comes over as a bit kind of not standing for very much. I think she's trying to sort of be too clever by half in in saying this is not the place to say what we want to do and set up budgets and so forth. And so I I think it is coming down to Sunak against Truss, And I I you know that you know the Tory party membership better than I do, but I think there is a very strong any anybody but Sunak thing going on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just to finish on this because, and to pay a bit of a tribute to Tom Teigenhardt because I think he is the guy who Deserves huge credit for standing up against Boris Johnson, for not being a minister in his government. I think he's been a really impressive he's he's made something of being chair of the foreign affairs select committee. I mean, one of my\n\nSpeaker 0: experiences I I wouldn't disagree with that. I I don't think he's been very good as a campaigner in this election.\n\nSpeaker 1: He was quite in the in the 1st debate, I guess. He had a certain kind of presence and confidence in the 1st debate.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think I think he got a bit smug in the second one, and I think he's I think he got too fond of his little one liners. I don't know. I just it it it struck me as it It just felt like it was all a bit of a game, the whole thing. I I could be completely wrong, and I may be maligning him unnecessarily, but I I I wasn't impressed in the 2nd debate.\n\nShould we take a break, Roy? We talked enough about these people.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let's take a break. Welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell. And you're doing very well, Rory, considering that you've been traveling for god knows how along with 2 small children.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will you be pleased here, I'm I'm eating a shortbread biscuit to try to keep me going? True Scottish thing. So while I while I eat my biscuit, Alisa, Can can give us give us some thoughts on the world.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thoughts on the world. First of all, just let's just stick with, you you were talking about Taiwan, and during the break, I was I was looking at an email. And I think this we can we can see this as kind of live journalism. Dear mister Campbell and team, I think that means you, Roy. I think you're now seen as my team.\n\nI'm a journalist at Commonwealth Magazine known in Taiwan for its in-depth reporting. We're currently working on a short documentary about how the global trend Towards populism has manifested itself in Taiwan, both in the failed KMT leadership contender Han Kuo yu and certain elements of the incumbent Democratic People's Party. Inspired partly, they're reading the right books, by Moises Naeem's recent book, The Revenge of Power about which, as you know, I'm obsessed. We're looking to make this a comparative piece and situate tie Taiwanese populism in its proper global context. And therefore, Rory, he goes on, as an avid listener of your podcast, I know that you both have excellent expertise and relevant first experience for the rise and fall of Boris Johnson.\n\nNot only this, but it's clear you have a keen interest in Taiwan and the Taiwan China issue. We would be honored if you could join us for a short interview to share some of your insight into these issues. So look, Rory, why don't we use this as the press office function? We don't have time to do the interview, but Rory is now gonna give you a few words about populism in Taiwan. Go.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, here we go. So firstly, for for listeners who've who've, haven't been following acedurist every second, as Moses Naeem, who is Alastair Campbell's, great hero at the moment comes up with 3 p's, which Alastair will remind us are populism\n\nSpeaker 0: Polarization.\n\nSpeaker 1: Truth, and post truth. Yep. Populism, polarization, and post truth. And, Actually, this is really becoming a very interesting framing. I I saw the president of Colombia recently, And that was the current president who's just come at the end about being replaced by a left wing populist.\n\nAnd that was absolutely what he said to me. He said, the one thing you need to understand about Latin America, He didn't credit Moses Naim or Alastair Campbell, but he produced the 3 p's, populism, polarization, post truth. And I think that The there's what's happening in Taiwan is simply must be part of a much, much bigger global phenomenon because it's obviously no coincidence It happens in Brazil and India and Poland and in its own way in Britain and in Trump's America and right up and down Latin America.\n\nSpeaker 0: And by the way, Imran Khan had his his party had Bit of a a big electoral success this week. There was a big regional election, which he did really well in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. We've been warning about, haven't we, on the podcast? So it's one of the things we're talking about. But people think that You can simply get rid of these guys, and they go away. And this is one of the things that I'm slightly neurotic about with Boris Johnson.\n\nYou you you think, and I think this is a the best case scenario that he's gonna go off and just try to make some money giving speeches and writing an a useless book on win William Shakespeare. But I I think, I I almost said Winston Shakespeare. That's putting his 2 books together, isn't it? But I think there's a risk, actually, for him as for all these characters that they try to fall back on a particular base that believes they've been wrongly treated. You can see him Ethan and his his speech today we're speaking today on Monday evening where he's just given this big barnstorming speech in the city.\n\nSpeaker 0: I didn't see it. Did you watch it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it? I caught bits of it. I mean, it's it's it's it's, It's him in his full barnstorming kind of rhetorical behavior. And I think what is interesting is that, obviously, we we all see on television people being interviewed, and we meet people. I just met someone in Cumbria who very much felt that Boris Johnson being badly treated, and he'd been betrayed by his MPs, and he was their guy.\n\nAnd I am very worried that he may try to feed off that narrative, And he may try to have that his competitiveness may drive him to try to come back into British politics and the way that Donald Trump and Imran Khan do.\n\nSpeaker 0: He may he may even fancy, a new a new party, which would be quite good. It'd be good if it was the right that split with all these parties rather than the progressive left. But I I I also do do you think, Roy, that is the the people will, however, be so lastly, in the TV debate or the ITV debate, Juliette Atchiam asked them all to put raise their hand if they would put Boris Johnson into their cabinet, not one of them would. Now there will be people who are saying that's just disloyal and etcetera, But what does it say about this point? They also she asked them whether they would call a general election, and they all said no.\n\nBut they're basically running on a ticket It says, we've had a terrible government and a terrible prime minister, and I'm gonna change it all, but I don't think I should put myself before the British people. It should only be decided by these aging Tory party members.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's true. Although, as we said, I think, in last week's episode, it is re remarkable that it's the exception rather than the rule of people actually coming in under a general election. Remember, Gordon Brown came in in the same situation. Gordon Brown's taking over for Tony Blair. Same thing.\n\nYeah. Well, I think he's midway through.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. He did come midway through, but he came through with Tony Blair's support. This lot are all now distancing themselves from the guy that very recently. They were sitting around the cabinet table laughing at all his jokes and saying that everything he did was wonderful. So listen, just briefly, you you've been in the States.\n\nWhat what's your What's your sense on, where we are in US politics at\n\nSpeaker 1: the moment? So one one, I think, one statistic that's very interesting, Support for Trump abunks Republicans few months ago was 90%. Shocking that 90% of Republican voters supported Trump. It's now down to 60%, but that's still a very, very big number.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think this is because of the hearings, which have been pretty horrific for him, I think?\n\nSpeaker 1: They have been unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. He, being the narcissist he is, is, now saying trying to disrupt the midterms by, threatening to announce that he's gonna run as president, which we've actually damaging for the Republicans. So they're begging him not to, and he's trying to What he essentially does is he sits in Florida, as we know, watching television. And, his price, for not saying that he's gonna run again before the midterms is to have all these candidates out there saying nice things about him on television.\n\nSo he keeps sending them texts saying, You weren't nice about enough about me on telly. Maybe I'm gonna go out and announce that I'm gonna run again before the midterms, and then they so, essentially, yeah, he sits there eating burgers watching Fox News Mhmm. Wants everybody to get out there and defend him\n\nSpeaker 0: for privacy. Terrific. Fox News has been a really malign influence on the planet, I would say.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. I I'm with you on that. Okay. Now here's here's here's the the the big thing that I came with. I now think that we are going Into a 19 seventies style global recession.\n\nIn other words, a decade of lost growth. Mhmm. And And I and I think a lot of things are coming together. One one of the things is something we talked about, which is the heat wave. Because, actually, climate change is going to cause big, big problems on supply of food.\n\nI think the security crisis, obviously, in Ukraine, is driving up the cost of fuel. The And food. Security tension and food. Security tensions with China will drive more and more people to try to onshore. There's gonna be more and more protectionism as they disentangle the global economy.\n\nAnd, of course, The reason we haven't had any inflation 40 years is a large part not to do with the genius of the Bank of England, which is what was saying. But But it's a great deal to do with the fact that China has been producing incredibly cheap goods. China has basically kept inflation under control. Add to that demographics. Our populations are getting older.\n\nAdd to that, we're less and less keen on immigration, so we're not bringing in enough young, talented people. So rising cost of production, climate change, older population, not enough young immigrants coming in. And add to that, I think that we're gonna go into a world of cyber warfare. And finally\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory, you you you you you I I talked earlier about the heat wave having a deleterious effect on my mental health and the other mental. This is not helping. I'm gonna come I'm gonna come on to did you see the the latest growth figures from China were an absolute Car crash naught 0.4% in the Q2, which is the lowest since records began in 1992 apart from the 6.9% and traction at the start of COVID. And and a lot of that and they're still doing the COVID zero COVID, strategy. They still got this massive property slump.\n\nShanghai GDP is down 13.7% year on year.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 0: And the 5 they've got a 5.5% growth target, which they now reckon is, impossible.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, of course, the only way in which they have been achieving it is by extraordinary weird bits of financial management, weird bits of debt. I mean, and and I've one one of the things that I think none of these candidates are grappling with and no politicians really grappling with I mean, I saw I saw quite distinguished democratic Congressman, in the states, yesterday, they are\n\nSpeaker 0: absolutely You love you love the distinguished adjective, don't you? You love the distinguished.\n\nSpeaker 1: Why? I keep referring to being on the podcast with this distinguished former communications director.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. You don't. That's why. Anyway, yeah, tell me what the distinguished\n\nSpeaker 1: Does does it sound better in French? Can I say distinguished? Does that sound better in French?\n\nSpeaker 0: Distinguay. No. It doesn't really. It doesn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. No.\n\nSpeaker 0: It sounds elitist.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sadly, it's\n\nSpeaker 0: a good idea. This distinguished congressman said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So distinguished congressman said is, of course, their biggest issue is inflation, cost of living. And he says they have to own it, but the problem is how on earth do they own it if they don't have a solution to it? So owning it means, at the moment, trying to blame Russia and Ukraine for the cost of living crisis. But all that will do is that will create Huge opportunities for any entrepreneurial politician to say, well, in which case, we should let Putin have that bit of Ukraine if it's causing this economic crisis.\n\nJust in the same way as I was saying, Any entrepreneurial politician will take advantage of the costs of trying to do climate transition.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. What was your sense in the States? There's there's there's a lot of kind of commentary around Europe, I would say. And I've seen a little bit in America, but you'll have been closer to it. The the idea that Putin is sort of quite happy with where things are at the moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think that the Americans, the American national security establishment, remain very Convinced that if they can get enough weapons and the right kind of high quality weapons to Ukraine, Ukraine can push back hard. Now that may just be that the generals are constitutionally incapable of not being optimistic. So their optimistic story is that Ukraine is better at mobilizing manpower, and it's got better equipment. And the sanctions are beginning to hit Russia. Their high-tech equipment can't be maintained or replaced.\n\nThe United States, it the amount they've shipped in there is beyond imagining. People now estimate that they've provided $50,000,000,000 worth of assistance to Ukraine.\n\nSpeaker 0: But hold on. I thought I thought Liz Truss was single handedly facing down Vladimir Putin. I'm I'm shocked that the Americans are also involved.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's it's extraordinary, isn't it? Whenever you go to the United States, you suddenly discover that, having believed that Britain was doing everything on its own, that somehow the Americans are spending 10 times as much as we are, and they hadn't really noticed that we were Doing quite as much. But the the, no, the $50,000,000,000 is it's only $50,000,000,000 would be enough in direct cash transfers to lift About half the population of Africa are out of extreme poverty this year. Yeah. I mean, that is a lot of money.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, no. Listen. I I don't think Joe Biden gets nearly enough credit for what he's been trying to do. He had a very tricky trip to the Middle East. Yeah.\n\nAnd there was you know, we talk about the way that the world has changed to for for an American president to go to the Middle East and Israel Palestine question. Yes. He addressed it to some extent, but it was so far down the agenda. His big thing was actually trying to repair some sort of relationship with the Saudis, in order to try and drive down the price of fuel. I mean, we're back to the cost of living.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and this and it's really difficult, isn't it? Because we, since the early nineties, have had a vision that we can, build a The coalition of democracies, and, of course, we failed to do that. What we've got is a situation in which if the world is getting into great power confrontation. Many of the allies that we need are not democracies, and that's gonna be very uncomfortable. Mhmm.\n\nMhmm. And it it also is is I think the other thing that The United States is deeply critically aware of at the moment is that they fear they're losing legitimacy, that the world increasingly sees them As hypocrites, I mean, it's been very, very traumatic for the Biden administration to see how brutal Pakistan has been in its refusal to join on well, I think Somebody produced a statistic that 8 out of 10 of the most populous countries in the world refused to back the United States\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. We we we kid ourselves that the world is united against Russia. It just hasn't happened. I was at, Sandhurst Military Academy this week, Rory with the Army Leadership Center.\n\nI'm sure they'd welcome you there as well. And I was I was, reading later the the latest iteration of the of the army leadership doctrine, and it's very heavy on values, standards, ethics, and integrity. Now I was very careful not to be too political down there. I'm well aware that you can't really do that when you're with the military, But they had a the this document had a wonderful page on what it called toxic leadership, which is it you find in this way. Autocratic, narcissistic, manipulative, intimidating, overly competitive, and discriminating.\n\nI am recommending that this book is read by whoever becomes the next prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 1: But and I I'm with you. I mean, I think and this is one of the reasons why it's been the soldiers, Wyatt's been Tom Teigenhardt and Tobias Elwood and Johnny Mercer who were quite quick to call out Boris Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, they particularly are incredibly sensitive to this and are most likely to be disgusted by this stuff because it's absolutely driven into people that you follow leaders who you admire for their integrity and their honor, and you don't follow people that you think are\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But listen, we we we should we should we try Close with a few questions. Francesco Roman. Francesco Papalia. I like this one because she takes you to task over something.\n\nWhat do you make of Draghi's attempt at a resignation last week, and what's your more general opinions on Italian politics? And, Rory, it's Lake Como, not Cuomo, there is no u after the c. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really good. I I I somehow I think I got the governor of governor of New York in there, didn't I? That's What's going on there? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So late COBRA. Yeah. But it was fascinating. There's old Draghi. He gets, no pun intended, dragged in to be prime minister of a sort of, you know, a kind of managerial, technocratic government.\n\nHe does a pretty good job. Italy's reputation seems to be growing, And then he has this because we're back to the thing about the populous virus, the 5 star movement. They they they won't support him on a major part the thing that he's trying to do, And he goes to the president and says, I'm residing. The president says, no. You're not.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's extraordinary, isn't it? It's no. It's it's it's mesmerizing. Well, thank you all so much for listening, and we've got a very special guest coming in. So we're gonna who we find out more about shortly.\n\nSo we're gonna finish this episode, but thank you so much. It's goodbye from me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.
