Welcome to the rest is politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And, how are you today, Asap? I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm fine. How are you? I'm I'm I'm I've got got got a bit bit fluy coldy, I'm afraid. So I hope I'm gonna be hope I'm gonna be bright enough for you on the on the question time. Well, Well, I hope I'm gonna be gonna be bright enough for me in Blackpool on Saturday, more to the point. I'll definitely be bright enough by Blackpool. I'll be better by Blackpool. Excellent. How's the, how's the reception to your TV thing on. I mean, good. I think in channel 4, we're very happy with the with the figures. Just remind just remind us, since this is Tuesday night's Make me prime minister. Rory. Rory. You're getting good at this plugging thing. Tuesday night, channel 4, 9:15, make me prime minister. We're now on to episode 3. I promise you, The next episode, episode 3, crisis management, is TV gold. If it doesn't win a BAFTA, I'll be very, very, very upset. But, no, it's going well. And I think there was there was a wonderful, I tweeted on Tuesday a picture of an article in The Guardian, which was about how awful All distrust was as prime minister, and the ad team and the algorithm had somehow conspired to have an advert for the program inside that piece. So I was very, very chuffed about that. I think it's showing the candidates that politics is a lot harder than it looks, but it's also, I think, showing why people, like the candidates, want to to get into politics because they don't like the way the politics is being done. So and I think as we as we go through and we whittle down, eventually get down to the final 3, I think people will start to see that there are some, you know, there are some potential very good politicians there. Good. Okay. Well, here's a question from Jill Logie. She basically asked how are budgets written, and there seems to be statement from trust that although she knew about the cut the 45 p rate, they hadn't discussed it with the cabinet. So question is, do chances just write the budget, and everyone finds out the content when it's announced to everyone else in the cabinet? I mean, I wasn't as shocked by her answer on that as others. And that's perhaps because I lived through the Tony Blair Gordon Prime years. And sometimes we were we'd be aware of the broad thrust. We wouldn't always have all of the detail. Tony, by and large, you'd expect the prime minister to know. But in terms of the cabinet, not always is the answer. And don't forget, I know Dominique Cummings has been on about this, that Liz Truss, he believes, was the leakiest member of the Johnson cabinet, that she was sort of, you know, briefing stuff out of cabinet the whole time. And if that's true, it may be that she thinks that of her colleagues, that if you tell them things, the chances are that they'll brief it out. And, of course, with the budget, That can be very, very difficult and very, very sensitive. Tablet is very, very weird, isn't it? I was thinking about it because there's usually more than 30 people sitting around that table. So you've got the Sexiest estate who run departments. You've got chief whips, and then you've got these ministers who attend cabinet. So Tom Tucenhut, you know, You know, for example, there's a junior minister in the home office, but he's attending cabinets of security minister. And one of the questions is how you can actually run anything, with that number of people around the table. I mean, when when I was in the cabinet with Theresa May, it was very, very wooden. We would all speak one after another, but there wasn't really much opportunity back and forth. And I'm Running this, this NGO that I'm working with at the moment, I can't really imagine running a sort of senior leadership team with more than 30 people And getting sensible discussions out of them. Yeah. I mean, I I think that I remember Tony Blair always used to say that if he felt the first that he knew of a problem that a cabinet minister wanted to raise was at the table of the cabinet. He'd think that our political systems and management systems weren't working. I think the cabinet committee system Run well is actually quite an effective way of of running a government. But I do you know, if if you look back over the The Johnson period, it does appear to have been one of the leakiest cabinets there's ever been. We actually had very little trouble with leaking from within the cabinet meetings themselves. Yeah. Well, it's been for been very weird, hasn't it? Because there's been all these attempts where they get the cabinet secretary to literally look at people's phones and check their WhatsApp messages and threads. And Yeah. So that started with Gavin Williamson when he was accused of leaking for National Security Council about Huawei and lost his job, which he's always very much denied, but that was the cabinet secretary at the time Seizing his phone and going through it trying to find out who he'd called. And, again, you obviously get this with Dominic Cummings talking about this trust, a sort of paranoid attempt to keep secrecy. Now Now here's a question from somebody who I who I know certainly know of, Celia Richardson, who I I think it was the same Celia Richardson, works for the National Trust, an organization which should be supported in my view. She says Arrival podcast, I think this may be the young upstarts, Matliss and Soper and Goodall on newsagents. A rival podcast looked at 55 Tufton Street, supposedly independent think tanks, and is basically saying that we should do the same. Now maybe we should later do a proper discussion on 55 Tufton Street because I share Her obsession with it, dark money, nobody quite knows where the money comes from. David w says, did 55 Tufton Street Decide who our prime minister should be. Now what's what's your experience at 55 Tufton Street, Roy? So I I've been I've been in and out of 55 Tufton street. So it's a it's a little, I mean, it's literally a street just on the other side of Westminster Abbey, and a lot of think tanks there. And, of course, very convenient For, members from the House Commons to pop over because you it's within the division lobby, so you can go and give a speech. And if the division bell rings, you can just about Sprint back in time to vote. You've got 8 minutes to vote before they close the doors, so you have to be within 8 minutes run. And there's a surprising number of think tanks Crowded around parliament square for that reason. It's not my style. They tend to be on the libertarian right of the party. I don't know whether Taxpayers' Alliance is in that? Absolutely. They're they're all they're all part of it. Yeah. But, yeah, one of the things that Priti Patel and Liz Trust very much did was to take as their Expans, their special advisers, when they became Secretary of State, they took them from the Taxpayers Alliance. Well, her her economic adviser now is from 55 Tufton Street. Right. And and one of the biggest critics of the u-turn, the w-turn on the mini budget, was Mark Littlewood, who runs the Institute economic affairs, which is also there. And I do think our media treats them like they are kind of independent commentators. They are players. They are political players, part of a very, very, in my view, hard right agenda. And so, Celia, thank you for the question, and good luck with your campaign to stop being undermined by them. So my understanding is that It's also we, you know, we use 55 Tufton Street as a kind of shorthand because although taxpayers' minds are still there, I think others. It was also where vote leave from Brexit Central were in the past. But Yeah. I think it's a way of pointing to these things. The most influential conservative think tank when I was in government was probably something called Policy Exchange, which was run by Michael Gove and then by Nick Bowles, Where where again, they very much didn't seem to like me very much. It's a it's an odd thing. I mean, I I when When I was running for leadership, people came to you in a very concerned way saying the head of policy exchange says you're not sound, that he'd be going around saying that to conservative donors. So it's, No. It's a weird world, but I don't think they choose the leaders. In the end, the leaders are, as it appears, directly chosen by that very small number of More elderly, more right wing people who form the members of the conservative party. Yeah. I I guess what the question means is that they they've so influenced the terms of the debate within the conservative party that that's what's That's what's happened. There's a great question here from Claire Q. I've just realized, she says, that Alastair is still in charge of Labour comms. Step 1, do a political podcast with somebody who appeals to soft Tory voters. Step 2, get it to number 1. Now I guess what that's saying, Rory, Is that she's thinking, Clare is thinking, that maybe you are helping to influence people to move over to labor. And I Think I'm right in saying that Nick Bowles has come out for labor, hasn't he? Yeah. Do you think I'm the sort of 55 Tufton Street of the of the new Starmer labor movement. I think you may be, you know, playing a useful role in that. What it was that the the Soviets used to call it? The useful idiot. Idiot. That's right. Gonna say that. I wasn't gonna say You've said it now. So I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna duck that one. Daniel Norris, as a regular listener from China, what would be your main concern and issues on the imminent reelection of Xi Jinping as he seeks to further strengthen his influence in the Middle Kingdom. It's interesting he's asking that question. Is he suggesting there's some doubt about him continuing? There have been sort of murmurings of of him being in more political trouble than we think, but I think I think he's fine. I mean, I I I think the regime in the end is in trouble. I mean, I think these COVID lockdowns have been devastating. Bits of the Chinese economic miracle are beginning to come unstuck. The property market famously is in real trouble. Debt and the banking system has always been difficult in China, but Unfortunately, I think that that's likely to lead to more extreme behavior, not less. I'm assuming mister Norris is is a Brit living in China. That could be completely wrong. But if he is, From a purely British perspective, my worry is that they don't think we matter as much as we did, and I think that will have an impact on on our trade and our power in the world. And my my other worries, I think they despite some of the setbacks that we've been talking about in relation to Putin. I think they think, they the Chinese think, that they are much stronger than they were when Xi Jinping took over, and I think they are. I think we have to accept that. It's well, it's also if we think about the fact that during the Brexit Sit, Refrainin. One of the big arguments made by Brexiteers was that by leaving Europe, we would be able to tie ourselves to the much more rapidly growing economies of China. And of course, it's true. You know, 50% of the growth of many of the European firms is in China. 50% of the profits come from China, and And the Chinese economy is growing much more quickly, the European economies. So that was a tempting argument if you were looking just at the economics. But of course geopolitics has changed all that, And we're now in a world in which betting big on Britain's trade relationships with China looks very, very dangerous when Yep. United States and many others are trying to decouple from China And where actually we probably feel, under assault from Russia and Ukraine, that we need to redevelop deeper relationships with our political allies in Europe. There's been some quite good stuff. Macron has talked about This new European political federation, which does trust, has said that she will host a meeting of, which I thought was a good initiative. Mhmm. But, of course, we would all hope that that might mean that we could begin to think about In and outer circles and Britain becoming closer to Europe again. Yeah. New mantra. Do you think the global protests about what's going on in Iran Will lead to a change in the region. And it also before we go into protests around the world, of which there'd be many, some pretty extraordinary Protests in the last 24 hours or so involving schoolchildren, inside Iran, which I mean, these people have got real courage, haven't they? Yeah. Extraordinary. I mean, you really do not want to be demonstrating in Iran. That is a brutal state. So do you think it will lead to do do you think these protests may lead to change, or do you think this is gonna lead to an even bigger crackdown? I'm afraid I don't think it's gonna lead Traumatic change. I may be wrong. I mean, people have been predicting change in Iran for 40 years. And for 40 years, one's been on the side of assuming that it won't change. Neil Ferguson's just just written an article trying to argue, I think, in Bloomberg that Iran, China, Russia, he thinks those regimes are gonna go within his lifetime. Possible. Possible. You can certainly feel some of the fragility and vulnerability in Russia. And, obviously, there is something fundamentally unstable in Iran about A regime where a very large chunk of the population, the educated urban population is so out of sympathy with the ideology of the government. Yeah. Adam s, I've been watching The Capture. And after watching Laura Kuensperg's interview with Liz Truss, I fear that it's happened. How robotic. Have you have you heard about the CAPTCHA? What what's the CAPTCHA? The CAPTCHA is this program that is essentially about a politician who becomes a victim of deep fake technology. So there are times when, for example, he is watching himself being interviewed live on television, but it's not him. It's like the ABBA Avatars that I've talked about at the concert. And it is kinda scary, and the technology is Kinda moving in that direction. So I suppose there are 2 points here. 1 is about just how incredibly robotic Liz Truss's interviews are. Fiona and I have been we we listened to her interview with Nick Robinson. And while we were listening, we were both sitting at the kitchen table listening to this interview. We were giving her answers before she was because she had she's She does these long pauses, and then we were predicting the phrase that would come into her sentence. Did she get it right? What what what was I got about 60%. I was very the phrase that works best if you're trying to be Liz Truss? I've been very clear. I've been I've been I've been very clear. Let me be clear. I've been very clear. She's in the round. We have to make decisions looking at things in the round. She says that one a lot. As I said in the leadership election, it's quite common. Putin's war in Ukraine is a very, very common one. But the but you do have a sense of somebody who's been programmed, And that leads to a feeling that she's inauthentic. But weirdly, not very well programmed. I mean, the amazing thing about some of the recent developments in AI is it's extremely difficult to tell, that it's AI sort of whereas Well, in the capture, it's impossible. In the capture, it's impossible. The guy is watching himself being interviewed, and it's really quite serious. So one of the things that I saw recently, somebody was Showing me some very interesting innovative AI where they've trained computers to answer examination questions. And it is extraordinary. I mean, within a couple of minutes, a computer can View out an answer to almost any examination question and produce a pretty impressive, well structured, well argued Essay with the right evidence. I mean, the community isn't yet producing things which are dazzlingly brilliant, but definitely I would have thought the kind of thing that gets you a two one at university can now be done by AI with no problem at all. God. Well, I wish wish they'd had those in my days because that's what I ended up with. Okay, Rory. Let's have a quick break. Now Paragraph Films. I love hearing about foreign countries in the pod. Can you talk about any foreign country where things are going well at the moment? Well, my bet for this is the US. I I think we're not focusing on the fact that Biden has been doing much, much better than people predicted, but I'm still very worried about the polls. I think all the things that got the American polling Wrong. The last 3 times around are probably gonna get the polling wrong again, that something about polling companies is always underestimating The core right wing vote, they did it with Bolsonaro in Brazil as we discussed in the last pod. Did it with Brexit? Did it with Brexit. Did it with Trump. Trump. Did it with Boris Johnson in 2019. Something oddly about the sort of silent, quiet right wing voter who doesn't quite want to tell the polling company what they're thinking against The very articulate progressive voter who is very noisy seems to be misleading polls again and again. Mhmm. I think it's hard to talk about America doing well though. I mean, I agree with you about Biden. He's doing a lot better than people give him credit for, but we're just yet another kind of terrible hurricane. I think the polarization issue is still there and very, very strong. But, yeah, I mean, politically, I think they're doing better than we can than the world gives them credit for. I think I'm gonna I'm thinking I'm gonna give another plug to my friends in Albania. Oh, yes. Very good. I think that is a country that's that's doing far better than it certainly far better than its international, reputation. But I guess the premise of the question is is right that most places you look at in the world at the moment, The Portuguese government's done reasonably well, I would argue, but they've got problems with populism coming up as well now. Rory, it's a very personal question here. I'm quite keen quite keen on the answer. This is from Neil Russell. Why did you not pursue an army career after your black watch short commission? Well, I joined the I joined the army in 1991, And at that stage, it was options for change. It was a very weird moment in the world. Cold War had ended. We were a type b home defense battalion, which meant that we were stuck in Shropshire Doing a lot of drill, but we had 4 blank rounds per man to last us for a month for our training. We were still looking at pictures of Russian tanks, and I believed That we were never gonna go to war again. I didn't begin to guess that within 4, 5 years, we'd be into the Balkans, then into Afghanistan, then into Iraq. It actually felt as though I was gonna spend 30 years rehearsing for a kind of play that would never get put on, and there were older officers in the mess. Blackwatch hadn't been to war. Pat from Ireland hadn't been to war since Korean war, which is the early 19 fifties. What he is, so I could just see myself becoming one of these kinda old officers sitting propping up the mess, eating KitKats said 11 sits, and they're marching over in our smart kilt with our swagger sticks to check on our sergeants. So it was no. It was not a good time to joining the army. And maybe if I joined 5 years later, I would have thought about it in a very different way. Do you regret it? Do you regret that choice? No. Because I actually found in the foreign office that I got I got to spend a lot of time with the military. I was based with them in the Balkans. I was based with them again in Iraq, and so I felt I got the best To both worlds, which is that I could do the political world, but I had much more freedom. I could get out of the camps. I could I was much more senior much more quickly. I briefly thought of it. When I came back from my walk, I did this long 18, 21 month walk across Asia where I was walking in through 550 Village House. So I very fit when I came back, And I briefly thought of trying to do SAS selection, but a friend of mine who was in the special forces said, Rory, They're not they're not really even if you pass, they're not really gonna use you. You you've got too romantic an idea of what you can actually do there. Here's here's a question for you. Let's just try to get back to you and off off me. Do you not like talking about yourself, Ram? I'm not going to be your therapist. Do you not like talking about yourself? Particularly, I I I suspect you're horrible talking Talking about the Army, because a lot of my colleagues I feel spend so much time talking about their time in the Army, and it's kind of embarrassing because you feel like a total fraud, particularly If, like me, you're only in the army for a few months, I mean, the whole thing is a Yeah. I get that. I get that. So couple questions. Take take whichever one you want. Clare Brown was interested in the barrister Strike and the state of the justice system. Mhmm. And David Adgar, on a more comical note, here's a question. Can analysts stop complaining when Rory says you and me? Rory's using a perfectly Valid grammatical systems since me is not the grammatical subject, the phrase you and me is. Does Alastair reply to who's at the door with I? I had a few of these, actually. I'm I'm sticking to my guns. I I I but we don't need to revisit it, but we you did have more support than I think you merited, Rory. Let me let me say that. Along the barristers, I think what we have is a criminal justice system that's in a state of near collapse. You know, if you think about the way that we talked about Suella Braverman's speech at the party conference in, in the main podcast. The extent to which they now basically, lawyers have joined those people that this Government feels the need to attack the whole time. Anybody who takes up a case of a immigrant asylum seeker is a lefty lawyer Trying to override the will of government elected by the people. I think we should be very, very, very wary of failing to treat, the rule of law itself and the institution on which it depends with a modicum of restraint and respect. So so the the image that lawyers have is of very well paid and, you know, important members are of our community. The reality for an awful lot of lawyers is, is a pretty crap life doing lots of crap cases, for very little money, and a legal aid budget has been absolutely hammered by your friend austerity. That's really shocking. And then we we should talk more about presence. We've been called up for Not talking more, hopefully, we'll do that in another episode. Peter Gunning, how do you balance both your work life and family life, especially if you and your partner work internationally? How often and for how long are you both at home. I don't do as many long trips as I used to. I don't like Long being away from home for long periods of time. But I think we've got the balance a lot better now than I did when I was when when we had children, which is probably getting things the wrong way around. It's getting the wrong thing way around, isn't it? I mean, I'm very worried about this because I'm doing a job that I really, really love, which is this gift directly job, but it's taking me A lot to Africa, a lot to the United States, and, you know, I've got a 7 year old and a 5 year old living here in Amman in Jordan. And it's tough Because you come back pretty exhausted off a plane, and I feel a bit mad because I pack 3 days with 14 meetings a day where I'm sort of changing hats Some changing subjects every half an hour. I feel like a total sort of comic fraud doing some kind of musical act, and then I stagger back for the weekend. And you got a cold you got a cold from flying. Exactly. I've got a cold from flying. Mhmm. So, yeah, that's all all pretty weird. Hey. This here's a here's a a thing. I don't know whether you picked this up, but Svante Paabo, who just won the Nobel Prize for sequencing the DNA of Neanderthals and actually suggests that People with Neanderthal DNA were a little bit more vulnerable to COVID. It was one of the discoveries that he did, and he also found a whole new species of human called the Denisovians By looking at their DNA. So it turned out along with Homo sapiens and Neanderthals Has he has he asked us a question about whether we have Neanderthal DNA? His father, you might have picked up on this, Sune Bergstrom, won the Nobel Prize himself in 1982, and this is the It's time that a child of a Nobel laureate has also gone on to win a Nobel Prize. Wow. Wow. Weird, isn't it? Who who was the 1st person to win a Nobel Prize in 2 different disciplines? Oh, gosh. I don't know. I'll give you I'll give you a clue as a woman. Blimey, I I really don't know. What an amazing thing. Yeah. Marie Curie. Wow. There you go. Two disciplines. Wow. Wow. That's pretty cool. But they were both in the science world. Now listen. Here's the 2 related questions here. Anne Marie Gillespie. Rory, Do you wish that Liz Truss would stop trying to be so interesting? I think that's picking up on the fact that she once told you off for being too interesting. And Lisa Featherston, this is more about Kier, What's wrong with boring? Well, definitely, when we're dealing with massive ideologues, we we all like a bit of boring. I think, he he's doing something right, isn't he? Because it's Reassuring at the moment to have somebody who seems to be steady as you go, professional, thoughtful. Yeah. But, I guess Liz Truss is is a bewildering phenomenon. Now, Alastair, you tweeted out about a tic that she does when you think she's lying. What's the tic that you picked up? It's not just when she's lying, it's when she's getting a question. It's when she lied, definitely when she's saying something that's not true, but also when she gets a question where she doesn't want to answer that question, She swallows, and she has quite an active Adam, Adam's apple. So you see her Adam's apple go up and down very, very quickly. So I really do suggest that somebody gets hold of her and says that people will notice this sort of thing. I'm afraid they do when you're under this Level of scrutiny. In fact, on this, there's a great question here from somebody called Nigel Booth. When you were in power, how much did you practice the art of completely ignoring a question and and giving an answer about something you wanted to talk about. I've tried this with my girlfriend, but I'm finding it very, very difficult. Well, people accuse us of doing that on question time, don't they? They think that's basically what we do all the time. I don't think we do that much. I don't think we do that much. But it but it is I I think if you're in the cabinet or the shadow cabinet, you have to do it quite a lot because of collective responsibility. You know? Like, for example, Rees Mogg the other day was asked about Michael Gove and basically threw him under a bus quite happily. If Gove was still in the cabinet and Rees Mogg was asked, do you think Michael Gove is a good bloke and doing a good job? Michael Gove is a very good friend of mine, and I think he's doing an excellent job. That would have been the answer. The terrifying thing is Boris Johnson. One of the reasons I couldn't stay in Boris Johnson's cabinet is that the go to question for journalists for months was, do you think Boris Johnson is honest? And all my poor colleagues had to go out and say, it definitely is. Now here's a final thing from from Abby Innes. Final question for me. What has brought us to this past where intellectual humility and the acceptance of uncertainty are seen as weak, as distinct from realist. And then she goes on to say, it's as though the high modernist 20th century is longer than we thought. So a sort of idea that We've got into a world where absolute certainty, rigidity, which is what we see from Liz Truss and Quasi Kuoteng, is considered more realistic than Expressing uncertainty and humility. But I'd I'm not sure about that because I'm not I I completely get why she's asking that question. One of the reasons Why Kuateng did what he did, why Truss went out and said what she did about it, is because, ultimately, they had to bow down to the forces of political and economic reality. And they sort of pretended to be humble about it. But, actually, if they'd been genuinely humble about it, I think they'd have found that would have done them a power of good. So I think the public is much more ready for people to be doubtful and to talk about doubt. Yes. They want people who can make decisions, but this constant Expression of total certainty. And and I think you've said about me that you think I always express myself with total certainty. And I do up to a point, But I'd I'm not scared to sort of go through the process of thinking about things. I saw one of her most extraordinary lines in her interview with Nick Robinson. She said, I'm happy to confirm I am happy to confirm that we made the right decision. Are you indeed? Why couldn't we get the o office of budget responsibility to confirm that? I'm happy to confirm we made the right decision. Well, thank you very much indeed for that. Well, I think we come to the end, and we'll see you all or as many as you that's gonna come, And hopefully, many of you will be there live in Blackpool coming this Saturday. There might be a little bit of music. You never know. Might be a little bit of music. You're not setting me up, are you? You're not setting me up. I Possibly because there's only 1 musician in this that'll pair on this podcast. Alright. Thank you all very much. See you in Blackpool. See you soon. Bye bye.",

I'm okay. I'm fine. How are you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm I'm I'm I've got got got a bit bit fluy coldy, I'm afraid. So I hope I'm gonna be hope I'm gonna be bright enough for you on the on the question time. Well, Well,\n\nSpeaker 0: I hope I'm gonna be gonna be bright enough for me in Blackpool on Saturday, more to the point.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'll definitely be bright enough by Blackpool. I'll be better by Blackpool.\n\nSpeaker 0: Excellent.\n\nSpeaker 1: How's the, how's the reception to your TV thing on.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, good. I think in channel 4, we're very happy with the with the figures.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just remind just remind us, since this is Tuesday night's Make me prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory. Rory. You're getting good at this plugging thing. Tuesday night, channel 4, 9:15, make me prime minister. We're now on to episode 3.\n\nI promise you, The next episode, episode 3, crisis management, is TV gold. If it doesn't win a BAFTA, I'll be very, very, very upset. But, no, it's going well. And I think there was there was a wonderful, I tweeted on Tuesday a picture of an article in The Guardian, which was about how awful All distrust was as prime minister, and the ad team and the algorithm had somehow conspired to have an advert for the program inside that piece. So I was very, very chuffed about that.\n\nI think it's showing the candidates that politics is a lot harder than it looks, but it's also, I think, showing why people, like the candidates, want to to get into politics because they don't like the way the politics is being done. So and I think as we as we go through and we whittle down, eventually get down to the final 3, I think people will start to see that there are some, you know, there are some potential very good politicians there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Okay. Well, here's a question from Jill Logie. She basically asked how are budgets written, and there seems to be statement from trust that although she knew about the cut the 45 p rate, they hadn't discussed it with the cabinet. So question is, do chances just write the budget, and everyone finds out the content when it's announced to everyone else in the cabinet?\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, I wasn't as shocked by her answer on that as others. And that's perhaps because I lived through the Tony Blair Gordon Prime years. And sometimes we were we'd be aware of the broad thrust. We wouldn't always have all of the detail. Tony, by and large, you'd expect the prime minister to know.\n\nBut in terms of the cabinet, not always is the answer. And don't forget, I know Dominique Cummings has been on about this, that Liz Truss, he believes, was the leakiest member of the Johnson cabinet, that she was sort of, you know, briefing stuff out of cabinet the whole time. And if that's true, it may be that she thinks that of her colleagues, that if you tell them things, the chances are that they'll brief it out. And, of course, with the budget, That can be very, very difficult and very, very sensitive.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tablet is very, very weird, isn't it? I was thinking about it because there's usually more than 30 people sitting around that table. So you've got the Sexiest estate who run departments. You've got chief whips, and then you've got these ministers who attend cabinet. So Tom Tucenhut, you know, You know, for example, there's a junior minister in the home office, but he's attending cabinets of security minister.\n\nAnd one of the questions is how you can actually run anything, with that number of people around the table. I mean, when when I was in the cabinet with Theresa May, it was very, very wooden. We would all speak one after another, but there wasn't really much opportunity back and forth. And I'm Running this, this NGO that I'm working with at the moment, I can't really imagine running a sort of senior leadership team with more than 30 people And getting sensible discussions out of them.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I mean, I I think that I remember Tony Blair always used to say that if he felt the first that he knew of a problem that a cabinet minister wanted to raise was at the table of the cabinet. He'd think that our political systems and management systems weren't working. I think the cabinet committee system Run well is actually quite an effective way of of running a government. But I do you know, if if you look back over the The Johnson period, it does appear to have been one of the leakiest cabinets there's ever been.\n\nWe actually had very little trouble with leaking from within the cabinet meetings themselves.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, it's been for been very weird, hasn't it? Because there's been all these attempts where they get the cabinet secretary to literally look at people's phones and check their WhatsApp messages and threads. And Yeah. So that started with Gavin Williamson when he was accused of leaking for National Security Council about Huawei and lost his job, which he's always very much denied, but that was the cabinet secretary at the time Seizing his phone and going through it trying to find out who he'd called.\n\nAnd, again, you obviously get this with Dominic Cummings talking about this trust, a sort of paranoid attempt to keep secrecy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now Now here's a question from somebody who I who I know certainly know of, Celia Richardson, who I I think it was the same Celia Richardson, works for the National Trust, an organization which should be supported in my view. She says Arrival podcast, I think this may be the young upstarts, Matliss and Soper and Goodall on newsagents. A rival podcast looked at 55 Tufton Street, supposedly independent think tanks, and is basically saying that we should do the same. Now maybe we should later do a proper discussion on 55 Tufton Street because I share Her obsession with it, dark money, nobody quite knows where the money comes from. David w says, did 55 Tufton Street Decide who our prime minister should be.\n\nNow what's what's your experience at 55 Tufton Street, Roy?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I I've been I've been in and out of 55 Tufton street. So it's a it's a little, I mean, it's literally a street just on the other side of Westminster Abbey, and a lot of think tanks there. And, of course, very convenient For, members from the House Commons to pop over because you it's within the division lobby, so you can go and give a speech. And if the division bell rings, you can just about Sprint back in time to vote. You've got 8 minutes to vote before they close the doors, so you have to be within 8 minutes run.\n\nAnd there's a surprising number of think tanks Crowded around parliament square for that reason. It's not my style. They tend to be on the libertarian right of the party. I don't know whether Taxpayers' Alliance is in that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. They're they're all they're all part of it. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah, one of the things that Priti Patel and Liz Trust very much did was to take as their Expans, their special advisers, when they became Secretary of State, they took them from the Taxpayers Alliance.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, her her economic adviser now is from 55 Tufton Street.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and one of the biggest critics of the u-turn, the w-turn on the mini budget, was Mark Littlewood, who runs the Institute economic affairs, which is also there. And I do think our media treats them like they are kind of independent commentators. They are players. They are political players, part of a very, very, in my view, hard right agenda. And so, Celia, thank you for the question, and good luck with your campaign to stop being undermined by them.\n\nSpeaker 1: So my understanding is that It's also we, you know, we use 55 Tufton Street as a kind of shorthand because although taxpayers' minds are still there, I think others. It was also where vote leave from Brexit Central were in the past. But Yeah. I think it's a way of pointing to these things. The most influential conservative think tank when I was in government was probably something called Policy Exchange, which was run by Michael Gove and then by Nick Bowles, Where where again, they very much didn't seem to like me very much.\n\nIt's a it's an odd thing. I mean, I I when When I was running for leadership, people came to you in a very concerned way saying the head of policy exchange says you're not sound, that he'd be going around saying that to conservative donors. So it's, No. It's a weird world, but I don't think they choose the leaders. In the end, the leaders are, as it appears, directly chosen by that very small number of More elderly, more right wing people who form the members of the conservative party.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I I guess what the question means is that they they've so influenced the terms of the debate within the conservative party that that's what's That's what's happened. There's a great question here from Claire Q. I've just realized, she says, that Alastair is still in charge of Labour comms. Step 1, do a political podcast with somebody who appeals to soft Tory voters.\n\nStep 2, get it to number 1. Now I guess what that's saying, Rory, Is that she's thinking, Clare is thinking, that maybe you are helping to influence people to move over to labor. And I Think I'm right in saying that Nick Bowles has come out for labor, hasn't he?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Do you think I'm the sort of 55 Tufton Street of the of the new Starmer labor movement.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think you may be, you know, playing a useful role in that.\n\nSpeaker 1: What it was that the the Soviets used to call it? The useful idiot. Idiot.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's right. Gonna say that. I wasn't gonna say You've said it now.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna duck that one. Daniel Norris, as a regular listener from China, what would be your main concern and issues on the imminent reelection of Xi Jinping as he seeks to further strengthen his influence in the Middle Kingdom.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's interesting he's asking that question. Is he suggesting there's some doubt about him continuing? There have been sort of murmurings of of him being in more political trouble than we think,\n\nSpeaker 1: but I think I think he's fine. I mean, I I I think the regime in the end is in trouble. I mean, I think these COVID lockdowns have been devastating. Bits of the Chinese economic miracle are beginning to come unstuck. The property market famously is in real trouble.\n\nDebt and the banking system has always been difficult in China, but Unfortunately, I think that that's likely to lead to more extreme behavior, not less.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm assuming mister Norris is is a Brit living in China. That could be completely wrong. But if he is, From a purely British perspective, my worry is that they don't think we matter as much as we did, and I think that will have an impact on on our trade and our power in the world. And my my other worries, I think they despite some of the setbacks that we've been talking about in relation to Putin. I think they think, they the Chinese think, that they are much stronger than they were when Xi Jinping took over, and I think they are.\n\nI think we have to accept that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's well, it's also if we think about the fact that during the Brexit Sit, Refrainin. One of the big arguments made by Brexiteers was that by leaving Europe, we would be able to tie ourselves to the much more rapidly growing economies of China. And of course, it's true. You know, 50% of the growth of many of the European firms is in China. 50% of the profits come from China, and And the Chinese economy is growing much more quickly, the European economies.\n\nSo that was a tempting argument if you were looking just at the economics. But of course geopolitics has changed all that, And we're now in a world in which betting big on Britain's trade relationships with China looks very, very dangerous when Yep. United States and many others are trying to decouple from China And where actually we probably feel, under assault from Russia and Ukraine, that we need to redevelop deeper relationships with our political allies in Europe. There's been some quite good stuff. Macron has talked about This new European political federation, which does trust, has said that she will host a meeting of, which I thought was a good initiative.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. But, of\n\nSpeaker 1: course, we would all hope that that might mean that we could begin to think about In and outer circles and Britain becoming closer to Europe again.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. New mantra. Do you think the global protests about what's going on in Iran Will lead to a change in the region. And it also before we go into protests around the world, of which there'd be many, some pretty extraordinary Protests in the last 24 hours or so involving schoolchildren, inside Iran, which I mean, these people have got real courage, haven't they?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Extraordinary. I mean, you really do not want to be demonstrating in Iran. That is a brutal state.\n\nSpeaker 0: So do you think it will lead to do do you think these protests may lead to change, or do you think this is gonna lead to an even bigger crackdown?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm afraid I don't think it's gonna lead Traumatic change. I may be wrong. I mean, people have been predicting change in Iran for 40 years. And for 40 years, one's been on the side of assuming that it won't change. Neil Ferguson's just just written an article trying to argue, I think, in Bloomberg that Iran, China, Russia, he thinks those regimes are gonna go within his lifetime.\n\nPossible. Possible. You can certainly feel some of the fragility and vulnerability in Russia. And, obviously, there is something fundamentally unstable in Iran about A regime where a very large chunk of the population, the educated urban population is so out of sympathy with the ideology of the government.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Adam s, I've been watching The Capture. And after watching Laura Kuensperg's interview with Liz Truss, I fear that it's happened. How robotic. Have you have you heard about the CAPTCHA?\n\nSpeaker 1: What what's the CAPTCHA?\n\nSpeaker 0: The CAPTCHA is this program that is essentially about a politician who becomes a victim of deep fake technology. So there are times when, for example, he is watching himself being interviewed live on television, but it's not him. It's like the ABBA Avatars that I've talked about at the concert. And it is kinda scary, and the technology is Kinda moving in that direction. So I suppose there are 2 points here.\n\n1 is about just how incredibly robotic Liz Truss's interviews are. Fiona and I have been we we listened to her interview with Nick Robinson. And while we were listening, we were both sitting at the kitchen table listening to this interview. We were giving her answers before she was because she had she's She does these long pauses, and then we were predicting the phrase that would come into her sentence.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did she get it right? What what what\n\nSpeaker 0: was I got about 60%. I was very\n\nSpeaker 1: the phrase that works best if you're trying to be Liz Truss?\n\nSpeaker 0: I've been very clear. I've been I've been I've been very clear. Let me be clear. I've been very clear. She's in the round.\n\nWe have to make decisions looking at things in the round. She says that one a lot. As I said in the leadership election, it's quite common. Putin's war in Ukraine is a very, very common one. But the but you do have a sense of somebody who's been programmed, And that leads to a feeling that she's inauthentic.\n\nSpeaker 1: But weirdly, not very well programmed. I mean, the amazing thing about some of the recent developments in AI is it's extremely difficult to tell, that it's AI sort of whereas Well,\n\nSpeaker 0: in the capture, it's impossible. In the capture, it's impossible. The guy is watching himself being interviewed, and it's really quite serious.\n\nSpeaker 1: So one of the things that I saw recently, somebody was Showing me some very interesting innovative AI where they've trained computers to answer examination questions. And it is extraordinary. I mean, within a couple of minutes, a computer can View out an answer to almost any examination question and produce a pretty impressive, well structured, well argued Essay with the right evidence. I mean, the community isn't yet producing things which are dazzlingly brilliant, but definitely I would have thought the kind of thing that gets you a two one at university can now be done by AI with no problem at all.\n\nSpeaker 0: God. Well, I wish wish they'd had those in my days because that's what I ended up with. Okay, Rory. Let's have a quick break.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now Paragraph Films. I love hearing about foreign countries in the pod. Can you talk about any foreign country where things are going well at the moment? Well, my bet for this is the US. I I think we're not focusing on the fact that Biden has been doing much, much better than people predicted, but I'm still very worried about the polls.\n\nI think all the things that got the American polling Wrong. The last 3 times around are probably gonna get the polling wrong again, that something about polling companies is always underestimating The core right wing vote, they did it with Bolsonaro in Brazil as we discussed in the last pod.\n\nSpeaker 0: Did it with Brexit?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did it with Brexit. Did it with Trump. Trump. Did it with Boris Johnson in 2019. Something oddly about the sort of silent, quiet right wing voter who doesn't quite want to tell the polling company what they're thinking against The very articulate progressive voter who is very noisy seems to be misleading polls again and again.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. I think it's hard to talk about America doing well though. I mean, I agree with you about Biden. He's doing a lot better than people give him credit for, but we're just yet another kind of terrible hurricane. I think the polarization issue is still there and very, very strong.\n\nBut, yeah, I mean, politically, I think they're doing better than we can than the world gives them credit for. I think I'm gonna I'm thinking I'm gonna give another plug to my friends in Albania.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think that is a country that's that's doing far better than it certainly far better than its international, reputation. But I guess the premise of the question is is right that most places you look at in the world at the moment, The Portuguese government's done reasonably well, I would argue, but they've got problems with populism coming up as well now. Rory, it's a very personal question here. I'm quite keen quite keen on the answer. This is from Neil Russell.\n\nWhy did you not pursue an army career after your black watch short commission?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I joined the I joined the army in 1991, And at that stage, it was options for change. It was a very weird moment in the world. Cold War had ended. We were a type b home defense battalion, which meant that we were stuck in Shropshire Doing a lot of drill, but we had 4 blank rounds per man to last us for a month for our training. We were still looking at pictures of Russian tanks, and I believed That we were never gonna go to war again.\n\nI didn't begin to guess that within 4, 5 years, we'd be into the Balkans, then into Afghanistan, then into Iraq. It actually felt as though I was gonna spend 30 years rehearsing for a kind of play that would never get put on, and there were older officers in the mess. Blackwatch hadn't been to war. Pat from Ireland hadn't been to war since Korean war, which is the early 19 fifties. What he is, so I could just see myself becoming one of these kinda old officers sitting propping up the mess, eating KitKats said 11 sits, and they're marching over in our smart kilt with our swagger sticks to check on our sergeants.\n\nSo it was no. It was not a good time to joining the army. And maybe if I joined 5 years later, I would have thought about it in a very different way.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you regret it? Do you regret that choice?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Because I actually found in the foreign office that I got I got to spend a lot of time with the military. I was based with them in the Balkans. I was based with them again in Iraq, and so I felt I got the best To both worlds, which is that I could do the political world, but I had much more freedom. I could get out of the camps.\n\nI could I was much more senior much more quickly. I briefly thought of it. When I came back from my walk, I did this long 18, 21 month walk across Asia where I was walking in through 550 Village House. So I very fit when I came back, And I briefly thought of trying to do SAS selection, but a friend of mine who was in the special forces said, Rory, They're not they're not really even if you pass, they're not really gonna use you. You you've got too romantic an idea of what you can actually do there.\n\nHere's here's a question for you. Let's just try to get back to you and off off me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you not like talking about yourself, Ram? I'm not going to be your therapist. Do you not like talking about yourself?\n\nSpeaker 1: Particularly, I I I suspect you're horrible talking Talking about the Army, because a lot of my colleagues I feel spend so much time talking about their time in the Army, and it's kind of embarrassing because you feel like a total fraud, particularly If, like me, you're only in the army for a few months, I mean, the whole thing is a Yeah. I get that.\n\nSpeaker 0: I get that.\n\nSpeaker 1: So couple questions. Take take whichever one you want. Clare Brown was interested in the barrister Strike and the state of the justice system. Mhmm. And David Adgar, on a more comical note, here's a question.\n\nCan analysts stop complaining when Rory says you and me? Rory's using a perfectly Valid grammatical systems since me is not the grammatical subject, the phrase you and me is. Does Alastair reply to who's at the door with I?\n\nSpeaker 0: I had a few of these, actually. I'm I'm sticking to my guns. I I I but we don't need to revisit it, but we you did have more support than I think you merited, Rory. Let me let me say that. Along the barristers, I think what we have is a criminal justice system that's in a state of near collapse.\n\nYou know, if you think about the way that we talked about Suella Braverman's speech at the party conference in, in the main podcast. The extent to which they now basically, lawyers have joined those people that this Government feels the need to attack the whole time. Anybody who takes up a case of a immigrant asylum seeker is a lefty lawyer Trying to override the will of government elected by the people. I think we should be very, very, very wary of failing to treat, the rule of law itself and the institution on which it depends with a modicum of restraint and respect. So so the the image that lawyers have is of very well paid and, you know, important members are of our community.\n\nThe reality for an awful lot of lawyers is, is a pretty crap life doing lots of crap cases, for very little money, and a legal aid budget has been absolutely hammered by your friend austerity.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's really shocking. And then we we should talk more about presence. We've been called up for Not talking more, hopefully, we'll do that in another episode. Peter Gunning, how do you balance both your work life and family life, especially if you and your partner work internationally? How often and for how long are you both at home.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't do as many long trips as I used to. I don't like Long being away from home for long periods of time. But I think we've got the balance a lot better now than I did when I was when when we had children, which is probably getting things the wrong way around. It's getting\n\nSpeaker 1: the wrong thing way around, isn't it? I mean, I'm very worried about this because I'm doing a job that I really, really love, which is this gift directly job, but it's taking me A lot to Africa, a lot to the United States, and, you know, I've got a 7 year old and a 5 year old living here in Amman in Jordan. And it's tough Because you come back pretty exhausted off a plane, and I feel a bit mad because I pack 3 days with 14 meetings a day where I'm sort of changing hats Some changing subjects every half an hour. I feel like a total sort of comic fraud doing some kind of musical act, and then I stagger back for the weekend.\n\nSpeaker 0: And you got a cold you got a cold from flying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. I've got a cold from flying. Mhmm. So, yeah, that's all all pretty weird. Hey.\n\nThis here's a here's a a thing. I don't know whether you picked this up, but Svante Paabo, who just won the Nobel Prize for sequencing the DNA of Neanderthals and actually suggests that People with Neanderthal DNA were a little bit more vulnerable to COVID. It was one of the discoveries that he did, and he also found a whole new species of human called the Denisovians By looking at their DNA. So it turned out along with Homo sapiens and Neanderthals\n\nSpeaker 0: Has he has he asked us a question about whether we have Neanderthal DNA?\n\nSpeaker 1: His father, you might have picked up on this, Sune Bergstrom, won the Nobel Prize himself in 1982, and this is the It's time that a child of a Nobel laureate has also gone on to win a Nobel Prize.\n\nSpeaker 0: Wow. Wow.\n\nSpeaker 1: Weird, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Who who was the 1st person to win a Nobel Prize in 2 different disciplines?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, gosh. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll give you I'll give you a clue as a woman.\n\nSpeaker 1: Blimey, I I really don't know. What an amazing thing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Marie Curie.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow. There you go. Two disciplines. Wow. Wow.\n\nThat's pretty cool.\n\nSpeaker 0: But they were both in the science world. Now listen. Here's the 2 related questions here. Anne Marie Gillespie. Rory, Do you wish that Liz Truss would stop trying to be so interesting?\n\nI think that's picking up on the fact that she once told you off for being too interesting. And Lisa Featherston, this is more about Kier, What's wrong with boring?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, definitely, when we're dealing with massive ideologues, we we all like a bit of boring. I think, he he's doing something right, isn't he? Because it's Reassuring at the moment to have somebody who seems to be steady as you go, professional, thoughtful. Yeah. But, I guess Liz Truss is is a bewildering phenomenon.\n\nNow, Alastair, you tweeted out about a tic that she does when you think she's lying. What's the tic that you picked up?\n\nSpeaker 0: It's not just when she's lying, it's when she's getting a question. It's when she lied, definitely when she's saying something that's not true, but also when she gets a question where she doesn't want to answer that question, She swallows, and she has quite an active Adam, Adam's apple. So you see her Adam's apple go up and down very, very quickly. So I really do suggest that somebody gets hold of her and says that people will notice this sort of thing. I'm afraid they do when you're under this Level of scrutiny.\n\nIn fact, on this, there's a great question here from somebody called Nigel Booth. When you were in power, how much did you practice the art of completely ignoring a question and and giving an answer about something you wanted to talk about. I've tried this with my girlfriend, but I'm finding it very, very difficult.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, people accuse us of doing that on question time, don't they? They think that's basically what we do all the time.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think we do that much. I don't think we do that much. But it but it is I I think if you're in the cabinet or the shadow cabinet, you have to do it quite a lot because of collective responsibility. You know? Like, for example, Rees Mogg the other day was asked about Michael Gove and basically threw him under a bus quite happily.\n\nIf Gove was still in the cabinet and Rees Mogg was asked, do you think Michael Gove is a good bloke and doing a good job? Michael Gove is a very good friend of mine, and I think he's doing an excellent job. That would have been the answer.\n\nSpeaker 1: The terrifying thing is Boris Johnson. One of the reasons I couldn't stay in Boris Johnson's cabinet is that the go to question for journalists for months was, do you think Boris Johnson is honest? And all my poor colleagues had to go out and say, it definitely is. Now here's a final thing from from Abby Innes. Final question for me.\n\nWhat has brought us to this past where intellectual humility and the acceptance of uncertainty are seen as weak, as distinct from realist. And then she goes on to say, it's as though the high modernist 20th century is longer than we thought. So a sort of idea that We've got into a world where absolute certainty, rigidity, which is what we see from Liz Truss and Quasi Kuoteng, is considered more realistic than Expressing uncertainty and humility.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I'd I'm not sure about that because I'm not I I completely get why she's asking that question. One of the reasons Why Kuateng did what he did, why Truss went out and said what she did about it, is because, ultimately, they had to bow down to the forces of political and economic reality. And they sort of pretended to be humble about it. But, actually, if they'd been genuinely humble about it, I think they'd have found that would have done them a power of good. So I think the public is much more ready for people to be doubtful and to talk about doubt.\n\nYes. They want people who can make decisions, but this constant Expression of total certainty. And and I think you've said about me that you think I always express myself with total certainty. And I do up to a point, But I'd I'm not scared to sort of go through the process of thinking about things. I saw one of her most extraordinary lines in her interview with Nick Robinson.\n\nShe said, I'm happy to confirm I am happy to confirm that we made the right decision. Are you indeed?\n\nSpeaker 1: Why couldn't we\n\nSpeaker 0: get the o office of budget responsibility to confirm that? I'm happy to confirm we made the right decision. Well, thank you very much indeed for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think we come to the end, and we'll see you all or as many as you that's gonna come, And hopefully, many of you will be there live in Blackpool coming this Saturday. There might be a little bit of music. You never know. Might be a little bit of music.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're not setting me up, are you? You're not setting me up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I Possibly because there's only 1 musician in this that'll pair on this podcast. Alright. Thank you all very much. See you in Blackpool.\n\nSpeaker 0: See you soon. Bye bye.",
