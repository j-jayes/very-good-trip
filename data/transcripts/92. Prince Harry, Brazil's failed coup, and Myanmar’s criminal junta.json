Welcome to a very unusual live recording of The Rest is Politics Ticks with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Anast Camil. And for those listeners who, you know, would like to imagine where we are, we're sitting in a jazz studio In Soham, we're being looked at by the very remarkable Gary Lineker. So we're we're all feeling rather kinda glamorous. Really sound feeling quite glamorous. You feeling glamorous? No. No. Not feeling glamorous. Gary Lineker doesn't make me feel glamorous. Last time I I've been here before because this is where we interviewed Helen Clark That's it. Where you were down the line. Down the line. Yeah. But it's quite cool. Yeah. Cool? Yeah. I don't know how we're gonna keep you off the drum set. That's the only thing I'm a bit worried about. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it didn't bring my bagpipes. You you're in luck. Yeah. Now I guess I reckon some of our listeners will be thinking, god, I hope they don't do the Harry stuff because there's been so much of it. But I think we should maybe briefly. What's your sense of what's going on with all that? I am sick to death of hearing it. I thought it was very interesting that Happy Valley On the BBC, beat ITV hands down in the ratings. I think a lot of people are getting sick of it. I said a few weeks ago that I've I've actually generally been very sympathetic to Harry and to Meghan. I think they are I think she has been the victim of racism and misogyny. I think he is a very troubled guy, and I think the trouble does go back to his mother's death. And I think the the media are vile. A lot of the media are vile about them, but I think you do lose a lot of public sympathy and support when you're making a 100,000,000 quid, to make books and films that basically seem to be focused on trashing your own family. I think it's very, very difficult. Yeah. It is very difficult, isn't it? And it all seems from the outside much more calculated. I mean, it's very clearly a very, very serious PR campaign, the launch That book, the different language editions, the interviews that he's giving away, there's a real sense that this is somebody trying to make a big story, yeah, on a mission. Would would you read it? No. I I wouldn't. Because? Well, I find the whole thing pretty tragic. I mean, I'm I guess, honestly, if I'm on the spade, I'm more on the side of the king And the prince of Wales, I I find this very uncomfortable. I've got a lot of sympathy for prince Harry, but, basically, I I think this is Very, very disturbing and sad, and, yeah, I don't I don't wanna see any more of this. But the other thing that I've noticed sort of checking on media around the world, I mean, it is global. I I looked on French, German, Italian news sites yesterday, and it was huge. This story is huge around the world. Now I guess the one thing that I think comes out of that is is that I think post the queen's death and coming up to Charles' coronation, I think there's a lot of reflection going on about the royal family, and this now is where that debate is taking place. And I think that is quite a risk to to the monarchy. I don't overstate that. I think they've survived worse. But I think if this is the basis on which the monarchy is being discussed, then it's It doesn't really bode well. It's deeply uncomfortable. And it it for somebody like me who thinks the monarchy is one of the things that actually functions well and has a good part in British society and actually helped us through. Somebody last night, I was having dinner with them. They said they said conservative parties played their Joker and played their wild card, which I thought was a good way of describing Boris Johnson from this trust. But, anyway, the monarchy seemed to monarchy seemed to see us through that. What is what is Sunak? What is Sunak? Yeah. 2 of clubs. 2 of clubs. It's our cheap shop. That's quite well, it's not that cheaper. You've done cheaper, haven't you? I've I've done cheaper. You've definitely done cheaper. Done cheaper. So a lot of the news is around princess Diana and the funeral, and that's something you were famously deeply involved in. I mean, any thoughts and any memories of that? Anything that you've Considered about that period in your life. I do remember everybody sort of saying I'm talking about everybody within the establishment as a well, within the royal establishment. Everybody's saying things like, oh, it must be so terrible for the boys. Oh, god. The boys. Right? Saying that. So then when you square that against Harry, for example, saying that his father told him sitting on the bed, but didn't hug him, okay, which I think to a lot of people sounds pretty unfathomable. Your mom's just been killed in a horrible car crash. It's gonna be absolutely horrific. It's gonna be life changing in so many ways. So I sort of had a sense of there was a narrative around the boys at that time. I certainly do remember the pressures that they came under The walk behind the coffin. That again seems to be something that has sort of settled in him. The the one bit I read, I can't remember if it was in the book or in a newspaper or in an interview where he said that when they went It came down from Balmor onto that walkabout when he these people were touching him, he noticed how they're wet their hands were always wet. And it was because they'd been crying, and he wasn't crying because He felt he couldn't cry because he wasn't meant to cry. But that must have been bizarre to have everybody else crying when they didn't actually know his mother. And shouting things about So I think I get why he's finds this thing really, really difficult. I also think the other thing I've reflected on, somebody sent me This thing about I listened to for when we were driving back from Scotland, I listened to a Nicky Campbell phone in. This line emerged that he said he'd killed 25 members of the Taliban. And it was just soldier after soldier basically saying, this is terrible. You don't do this. It's just not good form, etcetera, etcetera. And people say He'd done so well with his military record, the Invictus Games, all the stuff he did on mental health, and that was all sort of gone for the buzz. And so So I was still listening to this, and I then I tweeted something about it. I'd completely forgotten that the story about him killing the Taliban had been out before. Right. And the headlines in these same papers that are now absolutely trying to destroy him Yeah. Were all about hero Harry. Yeah. Yeah. Hero Harry killed Taliban. Yeah. He's out there on the front line, and he's really doing a man's job kind of thing. So that often happens, doesn't it, in in politics and public affairs, which is that you say something 10 years ago, you say it again, and people treated desserts nude. And you can I mean, I found this in my own life? I could get scandals out of something that I'd said 5, 10 years ago and nobody had noticed, and suddenly, it's all over the newspaper. But it's around the newspapers changing the prism. Back then, Harry was good. Now he's bad. And therefore, the same fact to the same line can be used in a totally nature way. Ghostwriters, isn't it? I I Believe the person who did this is also the person who did the amazing Andre Agassi autobiography, which I thought was incredible. And has written an extraordinary memoir himself as well. And which begins with Agassi Doing these punishing sessions in this 3 quarter length court in Las Vegas with his crazy Persian father who Can't afford a long enough yard forcing the tiny agassi to hit a 1000 balls a day and all this kind of stuff. But I guess a lot of this will be shaped by the ghostwriter's sense of how these books work and what he does when he comes out of those interviews. So it's not surprising that the Agassi book is about a traumatized childhood, and this book is also about a traumatized childhood because it's how the ghostwriter Structures of book. One of the questions we got this week was actually to both of us whether we whether if we'd been offered the job as ghostwriter, whether we'd Have you ever closed the book? I haven't. I came very close once with, Dave Brailsford, and I was also once approached by Roy Keane's Then agent. For various reasons, neither of them neither of them happened. I don't think I'd be a very good ghostwriter. You you've hit the nail on the head of why it becomes difficult to be a ghostwriter because I don't know the guy, so I could be doing a disservice, but you want to make this book as interesting as it possibly can be. Obviously, the raw material is gonna be good, But Harry has talked about a lot of this stuff, and I wonder if some of these the the stuff that he's really being attacked from attacked for now, Whether it's stuff that maybe the publisher has been pushing for, the ghostwriter pushed for. Once you sort of cross that line into saying you've given somebody else permission to define the parameters of your life. I think it be that becomes in its own way a difficult relationship to manage. It is very weird, isn't it? And then you get this sort of Serialization and media stuff, I wonder how many people will read the book because they'll feel they've read all about it in the media. I mean, I'm I'm actually worried about this. Like you, I've got a Book coming out this year, and I'm very reluctant to let it go out to serialization because I'm worried that what I hope is a a book that people are gonna read and enjoy Will be picked up in a few newspaper headlines. There'll be a few sort of I don't know. They'll pick up me being rude about Boris Johnson or rude about Liz Truss, and that'll be the story. And then everyone's like, well, I need to read Okay. I get it. That's a that's an age old, discussion that goes on. I've I think it goes a lot less with publishers now because the newspapers are paying a lot less for serialization, Which makes it easier to say no, I think. But the other thought I had through the whole week listening to Harry and watching him do what he was doing was I think I've said to you before that if ever there is a choice between money and reputation, always go for reputation. And I think that If it is if they're really getting a 100,000,000 quid, I think that's I think they made the wrong choice. I think they made the wrong choice. It's a it must be a weird temptation. Now domestic stuff, reform the NHS, you've been thinking a bit about Holland from the Dutch health service. Before we get on to Holland, Robbie, I mean, as you know, I love it when distinguished people get in touch with our podcast and say interesting things that allow us to sort of take the debate forward. This is this is Michael Jordan talking about the NHS. So Ian Kennedy. In Kennedy. Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who I mentioned Who you quoted last week. Yeah. Right. Yep. And he's the guy who he was the 1st head of NICE, the Institute of NICE. And by the way, he says you We're very bad about Frank Dobson because Frank Dobson brought in NICE Uh-huh. Which was a major reform of the health service. And and So here is it. Gave a nice job Serena Kennedy. Oh, that is such a Tory thing to say, isn't it? That's right. That's such a Tory thing to say. It'll that is good because it means it'll come back again. Rory clearly believes restructuring the NHS, which is usually code for introducing insurance based model, is the answer. It would be worth asking him, so I'm going to ask you, what is it about an insurance based model that necessarily inherently leads to better health and more health care? It may work in Holland, but it certainly doesn't in the United States. What's wrong with making a wholehearted commitment financially and politically To our current model. And how is restructuring the NHS going to produce more health care professionals, repair buildings, provide equipment, let alone address the h in NHS and rescue the social justice. Serena Kennedy. Yeah. Gosh. How interesting. Okay. Well, I mean, obviously, the US system is not a universal health care system. So US is a very weird analogy. US is basically driven primarily as a private health care system. But France, which has an insurance based system, Holland, which has an insurance based system, many other European countries, what it does is it gets away from the big monolith of governments running everything. And, obviously, this is maybe That's sounding too much like Michael Heseltine, where my more conservative side comes in, that Universal Insurance, with the government helping to support that, pay for that, allows Variety of providers, allows people a bit more choice, allows a bit more competition. She these were things that Alan Melbourne believed in. He got in charge as well last week, by the way. Oh, yeah. Now what did he make of it all? He he said he thought you were talking a lot of sense about him. He said how marvelous he was. But but these are not things that would be unfamiliar to you back in your days in New Labour, the idea that it's possible to have good universal provision, but But to do it with a bit more choice and opportunity. Well, I did have a look at the Dutch system, and it is interesting because it's funny. You you mentioned that, Gary Lineker is in the room. Do you know what the name of the department The health in Holland is called. It's called the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport. Now that is something I used to bang on about all the time that I felt sport should either be in, health and or education. Not in culture? No. Not in culture. It's like we treat sport as a kind of luxury. I went and looked at the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport. I looked at their website. We're reading this in Dutch. I wish I could say I was reading in Dutch. I speak one sentence of Dutch. Go on then. It kept a fail off my dawdles, I could spell. That's very impressive. Which means I've played my back part too much. Okay. But this is the only Dutch high low. It is, Apparently, my Dutch people say my accent is absolutely brilliant, but, that's the only sentence I know. But listen listen to this. This is the this is the website of the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport. It says the ministry is committed to improving the health and safety of life of all people in the Netherlands. The ministry aims for good quality, affordable, and sustainable health care and support. It promotes prevention and healthy nutrition and ensures first rate sports facilities for all From recreational athletes to professionals, the ministry pursues these goals together with its partners and, of course, with everyone in the Netherlands because we all want to be healthy, fit, and resilient. It then goes through the 3 bits in short paragraphs, public health, welfare, sport, and it sort of you read it and you think that is a health strategy. So even before you get to the funding, that approach with the focus on prevention and the focus on looking after our health, what we don't do. I believe The Dutch had a real crisis a few years ago, which very, very similar to some of the challenges we had around the NHS and then had to redesign their system to get more of an attraction. 2006. So 1941 to 2006, they had this if you were Kind of not well off. A third of people who were well off had to take out private insurance Yep. And the others had public health insurance. Yep. And then they brought this thing in 2006 on what they call this equalization of risk. Yep. And the deal is everybody has to have there's mandatory insurance, which you have to have. Yep. But the insurers, which are mainly not for profits Yep. They have to take you on on the same basis regardless of whether you've Got some sort of terrible underlying condition. Scush. Scush. Scush. And it does seem to work because the a big problem in the US. I mean, that's the horrifying thing. The US has got an underlying condition. You can't get insured. Exactly. But what's really interesting is that Holland has never been out of the top 3 health care systems in Europe since 2006. The the one that beats it currently is God. Blimey. I don't know. Switzerland. Switzerland. Okay. You mentioned the the Allan Milburn thing because one of the The things I read about, they talk about the Dutch talk about competition within a regulated framework. That's between the the the not for profits. And the other big difference with us, politicians are far removed from operative decisions on delivery of health care. Which is true with the Swedish prison service, which I'm a great admirer of. When I was trying to persuade the head of the Swedish prison service to become head of the British prison service, one of the things he pointed out to me is that Swedish politicians cannot get involved at all in operational decisions in Swedish presence. That is left to him. He gets some of that, and that was his Requirement, and I thought that was great. Bring him on, give him that power, but the British system really baulked at that. And and you can see why because our voters want us to have operational control. My voters' incumbent would not be satisfied if the Cumberland Infirmary was killing people, with me saying, hey. I don't have any operational control about that. That's all dealt with by the chief executive of NHS England. Do you think that's why the public aren't quite buying the government every time they go out and say this is an independent pay review body? Right on. Well, I think the I think in Britain, we expect our elected politicians to be able to influence operation. It was the same with, actually Had this over flooding and at prisons. So Michael Howard, when he was running, was home secretary, very much set up a system where the head of the prison service was supposed to go on radio and television and defend a a riot. Same with flooding. I think the the the scandal that Chris Smith got into with flooding was about him trying to say, The government trying to say flooding is a decision for the environment agency, not a decision of the minister. But definitely, when I was a a minister, I did the reverse. I always felt I had to be in the operational detail because because in the end, I was accountable. Mhmm. And you were the guys to stand up in parliament and answer questions from And I've got good enough really saying to someone they're flooded, Not my problem. This is dealt with by somebody else. So, anyway, that that's what what did you make of the, did you have time to read or see the 2 speeches by the main party leaders? We talked a little bit last week about their New Year's messages. The speeches were a bit more detailed. Yep. Did you follow them much? Did not. No, Toast fan. Teske, give us your unbiased view of Kia Sama's performance. Well, I'll start with Suna. Suna delivered these 5 pledges, which rang a bell. Just just to remind people so that he's gonna he's gonna halve inflation Which is the bank giving you forecast. Generate growth, and reduce debt. It's It's gonna cut NHS waiting lists, and he's gonna stop small boats. Were those the 5? They were the 5. Although, actually, when you read the small print rule, he said he's going to pass laws to stop the boats. Do Do you think that will be enough to get him out of trouble? No. I don't. I I actually don't think they met the scale of the challenge that the country's facing. I thought Keir Starmer actually Made a good speech, which he, for me, spoiled by this rather gimmicky line about having what he called the take back control bill. I'm all in favor of devolving more power to cities Yeah. Let's just get this. This is the guy that voted remain. And then when I was in the House of Commons, I was trying to push a customs union, thought the customs union was too hard a Brexit and wanted to go full single market, floating second referendum, and now he's on take back control. He's on take back control in a completely different context, and therein for me lies the problem. So Ronald Reagan used to say, if you're explaining, you're losing. He had to so so and he actually, what I think was a Was a one of his better speeches without that line. Yeah. But that line then became what people focused on in the media. Because that was the line that won the Brexit campaign in 2016 for listeners who may have forgotten the horrible stuff. I don't know if they've forgotten that already. I think I I think, we're going to loop back on that one too often. I but I I I do think that, it was a more rounded argument than he's made before. The whole thing about devolution of power was good. But I think to to use a slogan for what was a very tactical political reason and a slogan to my mind that is becoming more discredited the longer we go on. Obviously, we're in London, and I've been seeing some of my, colleagues, including some senior serving politicians. And I've got quite an interesting, sympathetic insight into Rishi Sunak from them. They find him obviously much, much better than Liz Truss And Boris Johnson, the civil servant, seems to like him more. And for all his flaws, I think the positive spin on him at the moment is that he works incredibly hard, Does his homework, reads his briefs, gets up early in the morning, cares deeply, obviously doesn't need to do the job, You know, financially, he's he's doing it because he's fascinated by these issues. And they also say he's quite good at delegating, quite good at trusting his ministers, so there we are. We are often knocking Rishi Sunil. Okay. As you were saying that, there was a something Bill Clinton once said that popped into my head when Tony was going through a very bad time And Clinton was over. Clinton was out of office by now, and Tony sent me down to the Ritz, I think it was, and we had this chat. And what I was saying, Tony's, you know, got we got this problem, got that problem, da da da da da, went through it all, and he sometimes feels he's not understood and getting the record out, etcetera, etcetera. And Clinton said, I sometimes think that Tony thinks that you should get a blue ribbon for the job. The job is the blue ribbon. That's what he said. So what you just said about Sunak is the absolute minimum that you have to do to be committed, to do the job, To focus on the detail, to delegate, that is the basic. And what I think he's struggling to do Is do anything much beyond that? And I accept where I will give him some sympathy. He's got a very difficult set of circumstances economically, socially, politically. But I don't see if that's the best his friends are giving you when you're on over for a brief visit to London, Rory, I'm not too worried. Well, let's let's take a little break on this and And come back after the break. This This episode of The Restless Policy is sponsored by the New European.

Welcome back to The Restless Politics with me, Roy Stewart. And me, Ernest Campbell. So Brazil. Brazil. Incredible. Right? Mind listeners, essentially Storming of 3 of the major institutions in Brazil by enraged supporters of Bolsonaro, military and police standing back and not really doing much to prevent them. Bolsonaro, at the time, in Florida. Luna, I think, was out of the country. He was in Sao Paulo. So it's terrifying, I think, what almost happened there and seemed to be taken straight from the January 6th playbook. And A reminder of the fact, although we often talk in the pod about how the fight against populism seems mildly To be going in a a positive direction with Joe Biden's election and Boris Johnson's defenestration, We can see populism fighting back all over the world, and nowhere more starkly nimburs up. Well, you've plugged the book that you're writing. In the book that I'm writing, I have the line that it is perhaps easier to defeat a populist than it is to defeat populism. And I think what you've seen with Bolsonaro is I I I think it's been quite surprising that Bolsonaro I mean, okay, he hasn't conceded defeat. He didn't attend the handover of power, but he hasn't been openly stirring in the way that I think people thought that he would. Now whether there's been a lot going on under the radar, I don't know. But I think it is I think it is genuinely terrifying because I think what you're seeing Is this is the consequence of populism because part of the appeal of populism is to attack the institutions of power. And Bolsonaro, what was interesting about January 6th, the Trump insurrection, that was about one part of government. That was about the capital. It's congress. Here, they were attacking all 3 simultaneously, the parliament, the law, and the presidential headquarters, if you like, so that all three Bits of the power structure were were under siege. And a lot of it again, we're back to the thing about fake news, disinformation. A lot of it based on myths, lies, disinformation circulating on private and sometimes public networks. And we when we talked about the Brazilian elections, if you remember, The week before, we talked about the fact the CIA had been down there trying to Mhmm. Say to Bolsonaro's people, you must concede straight away because we're worried. And then I think there's people taking their eye off the ball a bit because it didn't happen immediately. And for this suddenly to happen almost to the day on the anniversary of the The American riot at the capital, I think, just reminds you that this this could spread this could spread. So it's a reminder, isn't it, that once you get An extremist movement going, you can create a vicious circle. And I think this was something we saw in a very small way over Brexit, which is that As the different camps dug in the 2nd referendum against hard Brexiteers, things intensify, divide, polarize more. And all the way through Latin America, Whether it's on the left or the right, you get this sense of incredibly divided societies that the the right tend to perceive the left wing governments as though that they're crazy communist Stalinist governments, and the left perceive the right wing governments as though they're neofascist dictatorships. And There is not a center ground, although it doesn't feel like there's a center ground. It's been interesting though how, I think almost without exception, the main leaders Of all the other Latin American countries have come out basically on the side of democracy and on the side of Yeah. Of Lula. Yeah. Even those who disagree with him profoundly on on his These political views. But I look. I I I think that it signals that, as you say, we we ended the year quite optimistic because Bolsonaro had lost, because Macron won because Schultz was there, because Johnson had gone, because Trump had gone, etcetera. But, you know, if you look at what happened in in congress With the Yep. You you mentioned last week about the speakership. And I bet even when you were talking about that, you didn't imagine it was gonna take in 15 votes. It's Unbelievable. And the sort of concession that creates amazing crazy people who have now got real power. I read a wonderful piece yesterday on that Salon, the American site. I can't remember the name of the woman who wrote it, but it was basically saying, this is as good as it's gonna get. It's now gonna get worse because these people have been given a taste of real power, And they're not gonna abuse it. And I I you know, I fear for the worst on that. And then you wanted to bring us to the Czech Republic. Well, I think the Czech Republic is really interesting because there's an election this weekend. And Babis, who was prime minister Mhmm. And he's one of the the I think there are 9 candidates. And was narrowly defeated. It was, like, for 23%, 23%, but they got rid of him. Billionaire, Friend of Trump, populist, booted out very unusually because all the opposition parties cobbled together and knocked him out of parliament and being prime minister, but now running to be president. And and there's 3 of them. There's him. I scroll their names down. There's there's him who's the kind of populist Trump Erdogan type figure. Peter Pavel, ex army, and a and a woman who's in her forties, Danusa Narudova, who's the kinda young fresh face. But, essentially, it's a populist against 2 kind of seemingly quite reasonable people, but they're all in the twenties and thirties. Yep. And the the and the the electoral system is almost identical to the French. Yep. You have to get 50%, and so it is almost inevitably gonna lead to a runoff. If Babis wins, then Putin's happy. Yeah. This guy is very close to To Victor Orban. To Hungary. Yeah. It's it's also gonna be he he he's somebody who, I think, If he comes back, having been through that process you you've described, and then they that he had this case against him for corruption, which is now one, Nice timing Yep. Has to be said. Yep. So if he comes back, I think that is yet another really quite difficult moment for the euro European Union. And and Final thing before before we close, I want to remind people of, because it it hasn't been much in the media, is Myanmar. So you you'll remember in February of last year, Aung San Suu Kyi's government was toppled by the Burmese military. She won incredible victory in the parliamentary elections. She got nearly 80% of the seats, And the military responded because they were at their very, very weakest by basically a coup d'etat and initially going after on the grounds that she'd owned a walkie talkie and that this was an imprisonable offense. And they've they've just slapped her on her's hands on it, isn't it? 27 years on her, and she's 77 years old. So if that helped, she's never never coming out of jail. But Myanmar is now in the most horrifying situation, 1,400,000 people displaced, Half the country now in the hands of rebel groups, people printing weapons, using three d printing to print weapons to attack the military. Every university in the country closed, the economy collapsing, and this has been going on now for almost 2 years. We pride ourselves on talking about things that Unnecessarily getting that much attention in the in the media. If you defined what the what the junta have done in the last couple of years and just set out the facts of who's been killed, who's been detained, the the sham elections that are coming, and you set it against Putin, you know, they're in the same ballpark. 100%. And yet Nobody's really talking about it at all. Extraordinary. 2,500 people killed, 16,000 people detained. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying. And and I think because this is The Restless Politics podcast, we talk a lot about leadership. It it casts a question around Aung San Suu Kyi, who I I knew, And I I'd go to visit her in Myanmar, and I remember sitting with her trying to get her to come out and condemn what the Burmese military were doing to the Rohingya? She she was she couldn't do it. She wouldn't do. And what she said to me was, my position is much more fragile than you realize. To be much more careful criticizing the military than you realize. And at the time, I thought this was disingenuous, that actually she should be taking more risks, she should be challenging the military. Of course, she will feel in the sense that she was vindicated and that we didn't understand. No. But but also she the reason that she made the progress that she did was because she was able to build this network of international support, but there's very little sign of it at the moment. And you had the UN rapporteur, Tom Andrews, last week. He said, we're now witnessing systematic gross human rights violations, which amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity daily against the people of Myanmar. It's not even on the news. And the Chinese and Russians are, of course, vetoing any action The Germany Council. They didn't veto. They abstain, which I thought was interesting. But it's it means that the UN can do something. I thought it was actually surprising they didn't use the do the full veto. The the the general, I don't know how you pronounce him, Min Au Huang, he listed the countries that were on his side this week, China, Thailand, Laos, Bangladesh. Bangladesh has got a 1000000 Rohingya refugees. And the the other countries are sending back refugees. He was a man who controls 2 huge business conglomerates as well as being the head of the military. And when he was in officer training school, he was known by his friends as cat feces. And cat poo is apparently not a polite name if you're Burmese. I think even if you're British, I think cat feces is probably It's not not a good It's not very nice. Not not a good thing. No. No. Well, thank Thank you very much, Alastair, and look forward to speaking soon. See you soon.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to a very unusual live recording of The Rest is Politics Ticks with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Anast Camil.\n\nSpeaker 1: And for those listeners who, you know, would like to imagine where we are, we're sitting in a jazz studio In Soham, we're being looked at by the very remarkable Gary Lineker. So we're we're all feeling rather kinda glamorous. Really sound feeling quite glamorous. You feeling glamorous?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. Not feeling glamorous. Gary Lineker doesn't make me feel glamorous. Last time I I've been here before because this is where we interviewed Helen Clark\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Where you were down the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: Down the line. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: But it's quite cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Cool? Yeah. I don't know how we're gonna keep you off the drum set. That's the only thing I'm a bit worried about.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, it didn't bring my bagpipes. You you're in luck. Yeah. Now I guess I reckon some of our listeners will be thinking, god, I hope they don't do the Harry stuff because there's been so much of it.\n\nBut I think we should maybe briefly.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's your sense of what's going on with all that?\n\nSpeaker 0: I am sick to death of hearing it. I thought it was very interesting that Happy Valley On the BBC, beat ITV hands down in the ratings. I think a lot of people are getting sick of it. I said a few weeks ago that I've I've actually generally been very sympathetic to Harry and to Meghan. I think they are I think she has been the victim of racism and misogyny.\n\nI think he is a very troubled guy, and I think the trouble does go back to his mother's death. And I think the the media are vile. A lot of the media are vile about them, but I think you do lose a lot of public sympathy and support when you're making a 100,000,000 quid, to make books and films that basically seem to be focused on trashing your own family. I think it's very, very difficult.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It is very difficult, isn't it? And it all seems from the outside much more calculated. I mean, it's very clearly a very, very serious PR campaign, the launch That book, the different language editions, the interviews that he's giving away, there's a real sense that this is somebody trying to make a big story, yeah, on a mission.\n\nSpeaker 0: Would would you read it?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I I wouldn't. Because? Well, I find the whole thing pretty tragic. I mean, I'm I guess, honestly, if I'm on the spade, I'm more on the side of the king And the prince of Wales, I I find this very uncomfortable.\n\nI've got a lot of sympathy for prince Harry, but, basically, I I think this is Very, very disturbing and sad, and, yeah, I don't I don't wanna see any more of this.\n\nSpeaker 0: But the other thing that I've noticed sort of checking on media around the world, I mean, it is global. I I looked on French, German, Italian news sites yesterday, and it was huge. This story is huge around the world. Now I guess the one thing that I think comes out of that is is that I think post the queen's death and coming up to Charles' coronation, I think there's a lot of reflection going on about the royal family, and this now is where that debate is taking place. And I think that is quite a risk to to the monarchy.\n\nI don't overstate that. I think they've survived worse. But I think if this is the basis on which the monarchy is being discussed, then it's It doesn't really bode well.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's deeply uncomfortable. And it it for somebody like me who thinks the monarchy is one of the things that actually functions well and has a good part in British society and actually helped us through. Somebody last night, I was having dinner with them. They said they said conservative parties played their Joker and played their wild card, which I thought was a good way of describing Boris Johnson from this trust. But, anyway, the monarchy seemed to monarchy seemed to see us through that.\n\nSpeaker 0: What is what is Sunak?\n\nSpeaker 1: What is Sunak? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: 2 of clubs.\n\nSpeaker 1: 2 of\n\nSpeaker 0: clubs. It's our cheap shop.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's quite well, it's not that cheaper. You've done cheaper, haven't\n\nSpeaker 0: you? I've I've done cheaper. You've definitely done\n\nSpeaker 1: cheaper. Done cheaper. So a lot of the news is around princess Diana and the funeral, and that's something you were famously deeply involved in. I mean, any thoughts and any memories of that? Anything that you've Considered about that period in your life.\n\nSpeaker 0: I do remember everybody sort of saying I'm talking about everybody within the establishment as a well, within the royal establishment. Everybody's saying things like, oh, it must be so terrible for the boys. Oh, god. The boys. Right?\n\nSaying that. So then when you square that against Harry, for example, saying that his father told him sitting on the bed, but didn't hug him, okay, which I think to a lot of people sounds pretty unfathomable. Your mom's just been killed in a horrible car crash. It's gonna be absolutely horrific. It's gonna be life changing in so many ways.\n\nSo I sort of had a sense of there was a narrative around the boys at that time. I certainly do remember the pressures that they came under The walk behind the coffin. That again seems to be something that has sort of settled in him. The the one bit I read, I can't remember if it was in the book or in a newspaper or in an interview where he said that when they went It came down from Balmor onto that walkabout when he these people were touching him, he noticed how they're wet their hands were always wet. And it was because they'd been crying, and he wasn't crying because He felt he couldn't cry because he wasn't meant to cry.\n\nBut that\n\nSpeaker 1: must have been bizarre to have everybody else crying when they didn't actually know his mother.\n\nSpeaker 0: And shouting things about So I think I get why he's finds this thing really, really difficult. I also think the other thing I've reflected on, somebody sent me This thing about I listened to for when we were driving back from Scotland, I listened to a Nicky Campbell phone in. This line emerged that he said he'd killed 25 members of the Taliban. And it was just soldier after soldier basically saying, this is terrible. You don't do this.\n\nIt's just not good form, etcetera, etcetera. And people say He'd done so well with his military record, the Invictus Games, all the stuff he did on mental health, and that was all sort of gone for the buzz. And so So I was still listening to this, and I then I tweeted something about it. I'd completely forgotten that the story about him killing the Taliban had been out before. Right.\n\nAnd the headlines in these same papers that are now absolutely trying to destroy him Yeah. Were all about hero Harry. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Hero Harry killed Taliban. Yeah. He's out there on the front line, and he's really doing a man's job\n\nSpeaker 1: kind of thing. So that often happens, doesn't it, in in politics and public affairs, which is that you say something 10 years ago, you say it again, and people treated desserts nude. And you can I mean, I found this in my own life? I could get scandals out of something that I'd said 5, 10 years ago and nobody had noticed, and suddenly, it's all\n\nSpeaker 0: over the newspaper. But it's around the newspapers changing the prism. Back then, Harry was good. Now he's bad. And therefore, the same fact to the same line can be used in a totally nature way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ghostwriters, isn't it? I I Believe the person who did this is also the person who did the amazing Andre Agassi autobiography, which I thought was incredible.\n\nSpeaker 0: And has written an extraordinary memoir himself as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And which begins with Agassi Doing these punishing sessions in this 3 quarter length court in Las Vegas with his crazy Persian father who Can't afford a long enough yard forcing the tiny agassi to hit a 1000 balls a day and all this kind of stuff. But I guess a lot of this will be shaped by the ghostwriter's sense of how these books work and what he does when he comes out of those interviews. So it's not surprising that the Agassi book is about a traumatized childhood, and this book is also about a traumatized childhood because it's how the ghostwriter\n\nSpeaker 0: Structures of book. One of the questions we got this week was actually to both of us whether we whether if we'd been offered the job as ghostwriter, whether we'd\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you ever closed the book?\n\nSpeaker 0: I haven't. I came very close once with, Dave Brailsford, and I was also once approached by Roy Keane's Then agent. For various reasons, neither of them neither of them happened. I don't think I'd be a very good ghostwriter. You you've hit the nail on the head of why it becomes difficult to be a ghostwriter because I don't know the guy, so I could be doing a disservice, but you want to make this book as interesting as it possibly can be.\n\nObviously, the raw material is gonna be good, But Harry has talked about a lot of this stuff, and I wonder if some of these the the stuff that he's really being attacked from attacked for now, Whether it's stuff that maybe the publisher has been pushing for, the ghostwriter pushed for. Once you sort of cross that line into saying you've given somebody else permission to define the parameters of your life. I think it be that becomes in its own way a difficult relationship to manage.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is very weird, isn't it? And then you get this sort of Serialization and media stuff, I wonder how many people will read the book because they'll feel they've read all about it in the media. I mean, I'm I'm actually worried about this. Like you, I've got a Book coming out this year, and I'm very reluctant to let it go out to serialization because I'm worried that what I hope is a a book that people are gonna read and enjoy Will be picked up in a few newspaper headlines. There'll be a few sort of I don't know.\n\nThey'll pick up me being rude about Boris Johnson or rude about Liz Truss, and that'll be the story. And then everyone's like, well, I need to read Okay. I get\n\nSpeaker 0: it. That's a that's an age old, discussion that goes on. I've I think it goes a lot less with publishers now because the newspapers are paying a lot less for serialization, Which makes it easier to say no, I think. But the other thought I had through the whole week listening to Harry and watching him do what he was doing was I think I've said to you before that if ever there is a choice between money and reputation, always go for reputation. And I think that If it is if they're really getting a 100,000,000 quid, I think that's I think they made the wrong choice.\n\nI think they made the wrong choice.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a it must be a weird temptation. Now domestic stuff, reform the NHS, you've been thinking a bit about Holland from the Dutch health service.\n\nSpeaker 0: Before we get on to Holland, Robbie, I mean, as you know, I love it when distinguished people get in touch with our podcast and say interesting things that allow us to sort of take the debate forward. This is\n\nSpeaker 1: this is Michael Jordan talking about the NHS.\n\nSpeaker 0: So Ian Kennedy.\n\nSpeaker 1: In Kennedy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Professor Sir Ian Kennedy, who I mentioned\n\nSpeaker 1: Who you quoted last week. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Yep. And he's the guy who he was the 1st head of NICE, the Institute of NICE. And by the way, he says you We're very bad about Frank Dobson because Frank Dobson brought in NICE\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which was a major reform of the health service. And and So here is it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gave a nice job Serena Kennedy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, that is such a Tory thing to say, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's such a Tory thing to say. It'll that is good because it means it'll come back again. Rory clearly believes restructuring the NHS, which is usually code for introducing insurance based model, is the answer. It would be worth asking him, so I'm going to ask you, what is it about an insurance based model that necessarily inherently leads to better health and more health care? It may work in Holland, but it certainly doesn't in the United States.\n\nWhat's wrong with making a wholehearted commitment financially and politically To our current model. And how is restructuring the NHS going to produce more health care professionals, repair buildings, provide equipment, let alone address the h in NHS and rescue the social justice.\n\nSpeaker 1: Serena Kennedy. Yeah. Gosh. How interesting. Okay.\n\nWell, I mean, obviously, the US system is not a universal health care system. So US is a very weird analogy. US is basically driven primarily as a private health care system. But France, which has an insurance based system, Holland, which has an insurance based system, many other European countries, what it does is it gets away from the big monolith of governments running everything. And, obviously, this is maybe That's sounding too much like Michael Heseltine, where my more conservative side comes in, that Universal Insurance, with the government helping to support that, pay for that, allows Variety of providers, allows people a bit more choice, allows a bit more competition.\n\nShe these were things that Alan Melbourne believed in. He got\n\nSpeaker 0: in charge as well last week, by the way.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Now what did he make of it all?\n\nSpeaker 0: He he said he thought you were talking a lot of sense about him. He said how marvelous he was.\n\nSpeaker 1: But but these are not things that would be unfamiliar to you back in your days in New Labour, the idea that it's possible to have good universal provision, but But to do it with a bit more choice and opportunity.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I did have a look at the Dutch system, and it is interesting because it's funny. You you mentioned that, Gary Lineker is in the room. Do you know what the name of the department The health in Holland is called. It's called the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport. Now that is something I used to bang on about all the time that I felt sport should either be in, health and or education.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not in culture?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Not in culture. It's like we treat sport as a kind of luxury. I went and looked at the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport. I looked at their website.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're reading this in Dutch.\n\nSpeaker 0: I wish I could say I was reading in Dutch. I speak one sentence of Dutch.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go on then.\n\nSpeaker 0: It kept a fail off my dawdles, I could spell.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's very impressive.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which means I've played my back part too much. Okay. But this is the only Dutch high low. It is, Apparently, my Dutch people say my accent is absolutely brilliant, but, that's the only sentence I know. But listen listen to this.\n\nThis is the this is the website of the Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport. It says the ministry is committed to improving the health and safety of life of all people in the Netherlands. The ministry aims for good quality, affordable, and sustainable health care and support. It promotes prevention and healthy nutrition and ensures first rate sports facilities for all From recreational athletes to professionals, the ministry pursues these goals together with its partners and, of course, with everyone in the Netherlands because we all want to be healthy, fit, and resilient. It then goes through the 3 bits in short paragraphs, public health, welfare, sport, and it sort of you read it and you think that is a health strategy.\n\nSo even before you get to the funding, that approach with the focus on prevention and the focus on looking after our health, what we don't do.\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe The Dutch had a real crisis a few years ago, which very, very similar to some of the challenges we had around the NHS and then had to redesign their system to get more of\n\nSpeaker 0: an attraction. 2006. So 1941 to 2006, they had this if you were Kind of not well off. A third of people who were well off had to take out private insurance\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: And the others had public health insurance.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. And\n\nSpeaker 0: then they brought this thing in 2006 on what they call this equalization of risk. Yep. And the deal is everybody has to have there's mandatory insurance, which you have to have. Yep. But the insurers, which are mainly not for profits Yep.\n\nThey have to take you on on the same basis regardless of whether you've Got some sort of terrible underlying condition. Scush. Scush. Scush. And it does seem to work because the\n\nSpeaker 1: a big problem in the US. I mean, that's the horrifying thing. The US has got an underlying condition. You can't get insured. Exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: But what's really interesting is that Holland has never been out of the top 3 health care systems in Europe since 2006. The the one that beats it currently is\n\nSpeaker 1: God. Blimey. I don't know. Switzerland. Switzerland.\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 0: You mentioned the the Allan Milburn thing because one of the The things I read about, they talk about the Dutch talk about competition within a regulated framework. That's between the the the not for profits. And the other big difference with us, politicians are far removed from operative decisions on delivery of health care.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is true with the Swedish prison service, which I'm a great admirer of. When I was trying to persuade the head of the Swedish prison service to become head of the British prison service, one of the things he pointed out to me is that Swedish politicians cannot get involved at all in operational decisions in Swedish presence. That is left to him. He gets some of that, and that was his Requirement, and I thought that was great. Bring him on, give him that power, but the British system really baulked at that.\n\nAnd and you can see why because our voters want us to have operational control. My voters' incumbent would not be satisfied if the Cumberland Infirmary was killing people, with me saying, hey. I don't have any operational control about that. That's all dealt with by the chief executive of NHS England.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think that's why the public aren't quite buying the government every time they go out and say this is an independent pay review body?\n\nSpeaker 1: Right on. Well, I think the I think in Britain, we expect our elected politicians to be able to influence operation. It was the same with, actually Had this over flooding and at prisons. So Michael Howard, when he was running, was home secretary, very much set up a system where the head of the prison service was supposed to go on radio and television and defend a a riot. Same with flooding.\n\nI think the the the scandal that Chris Smith got into with flooding was about him trying to say, The government trying to say flooding is a decision for the environment agency, not a decision of the minister. But definitely, when I was a a minister, I did the reverse. I always felt I had to be in the operational detail because because in the end, I was accountable.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. And you were the guys to stand up in parliament and answer questions from\n\nSpeaker 1: And I've got good enough really saying to someone they're flooded, Not my problem. This is dealt with by somebody else.\n\nSpeaker 0: So, anyway, that that's what what did you make of the, did you have time to read or see the 2 speeches by the main party leaders? We talked a little bit last week about their New Year's messages. The speeches were a bit more detailed. Yep. Did you follow them much?\n\nSpeaker 1: Did not. No, Toast fan. Teske, give us your unbiased view of Kia Sama's performance.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'll start with Suna. Suna delivered these 5 pledges, which rang a bell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just just to remind people so that he's gonna he's gonna halve inflation\n\nSpeaker 0: Which is the bank giving you forecast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Generate growth,\n\nSpeaker 0: and reduce debt.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's It's gonna cut NHS waiting lists, and he's gonna stop small boats. Were those the 5?\n\nSpeaker 0: They were the 5. Although, actually, when you read the small print rule, he said he's going to pass laws to stop the boats. Do\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you think that will be enough to get him out of trouble?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I don't. I I actually don't think they met the scale of the challenge that the country's facing. I thought Keir Starmer actually Made a good speech, which he, for me, spoiled by this rather gimmicky line about having what he called the take back control bill. I'm all in favor of devolving more power to cities Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's just get this. This is the guy that voted remain. And then when I was in the House of Commons, I was trying to push a customs union, thought the customs union was too hard a Brexit and wanted to go full single market, floating second referendum, and now he's on\n\nSpeaker 0: take back control. He's on take back control in a completely different context, and therein for me lies the problem. So Ronald Reagan used to say, if you're explaining, you're losing. He had to so so and he actually, what I think was a Was a one of his better speeches without that line. Yeah.\n\nBut that line then became what people focused on in the media.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because that was the line that won the Brexit campaign in 2016 for listeners who may have forgotten the horrible stuff.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't know if they've forgotten that already. I think I I think, we're going to loop back on that one too often. I but I I I do think that, it was a more rounded argument than he's made before. The whole thing about devolution of power was good. But I think to to use a slogan for what was a very tactical political reason and a slogan to my mind that is becoming more discredited the longer we go on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Obviously, we're in London, and I've been seeing some of my, colleagues, including some senior serving politicians. And I've got quite an interesting, sympathetic insight into Rishi Sunak from them. They find him obviously much, much better than Liz Truss And Boris Johnson, the civil servant, seems to like him more. And for all his flaws, I think the positive spin on him at the moment is that he works incredibly hard, Does his homework, reads his briefs, gets up early in the morning, cares deeply, obviously doesn't need to do the job, You know, financially, he's he's doing it because he's fascinated by these issues. And they also say he's quite good at delegating, quite good at trusting his ministers, so there we are.\n\nWe are often knocking Rishi Sunil.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. As you were saying that, there was a something Bill Clinton once said that popped into my head when Tony was going through a very bad time And Clinton was over. Clinton was out of office by now, and Tony sent me down to the Ritz, I think it was, and we had this chat. And what I was saying, Tony's, you know, got we got this problem, got that problem, da da da da da, went through it all, and he sometimes feels he's not understood and getting the record out, etcetera, etcetera. And Clinton said, I sometimes think that Tony thinks that you should get a blue ribbon for the job.\n\nThe job is the blue ribbon. That's what he said. So what you just said about Sunak is the absolute minimum that you have to do to be committed, to do the job, To focus on the detail, to delegate, that is the basic. And what I think he's struggling to do Is do anything much beyond that? And I accept where I will give him some sympathy.\n\nHe's got a very difficult set of circumstances economically, socially, politically. But I don't see if that's the best his friends are giving you when you're on over for a brief visit to London, Rory, I'm not too worried.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let's let's take a little break on this and And come back after the break.\n\nSpeaker 0: This This episode of The Restless Policy is sponsored by the New European.

It was their best ever month for new subscribers, and and they've decided to extend the offer for a limited period.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we had a look at it, didn't we, in the Royal Albert Hall?

Www.neweuropean.co.uk/trip.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome back to The Restless Politics with me, Roy Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Ernest Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Brazil.\n\nSpeaker 0: Brazil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Incredible. Right? Mind listeners, essentially Storming of 3 of the major institutions in Brazil by enraged supporters of Bolsonaro, military and police standing back and not really doing much to prevent them. Bolsonaro, at the time, in Florida. Luna, I think, was out of the country.\n\nSpeaker 0: He was in Sao Paulo.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it's terrifying, I think, what almost happened there and seemed to be taken straight from the January 6th playbook. And A reminder of the fact, although we often talk in the pod about how the fight against populism seems mildly To be going in a a positive direction with Joe Biden's election and Boris Johnson's defenestration, We can see populism fighting back all over the world, and nowhere more starkly nimburs up.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, you've plugged the book that you're writing. In the book that I'm writing, I have the line that it is perhaps easier to defeat a populist than it is to defeat populism. And I think what you've seen with Bolsonaro is I I I think it's been quite surprising that Bolsonaro I mean, okay, he hasn't conceded defeat. He didn't attend the handover of power, but he hasn't been openly stirring in the way that I think people thought that he would. Now whether there's been a lot going on under the radar, I don't know.\n\nBut I think it is I think it is genuinely terrifying because I think what you're seeing Is this is the consequence of populism because part of the appeal of populism is to attack the institutions of power. And Bolsonaro, what was interesting about January 6th, the Trump insurrection, that was about one part of government. That was about the capital. It's congress. Here, they were attacking all 3 simultaneously, the parliament, the law, and the presidential headquarters, if you like, so that all three Bits of the power structure were were under siege.\n\nAnd a lot of it again, we're back to the thing about fake news, disinformation. A lot of it based on myths, lies, disinformation circulating on private and sometimes public networks. And we when we talked about the Brazilian elections, if you remember, The week before, we talked about the fact the CIA had been down there trying to Mhmm. Say to Bolsonaro's people, you must concede straight away because we're worried. And then I think there's people taking their eye off the ball a bit because it didn't happen immediately.\n\nAnd for this suddenly to happen almost to the day on the anniversary of the The American riot at the capital, I think, just reminds you that this this could spread this could spread. So it's\n\nSpeaker 1: a reminder, isn't it, that once you get An extremist movement going, you can create a vicious circle. And I think this was something we saw in a very small way over Brexit, which is that As the different camps dug in the 2nd referendum against hard Brexiteers, things intensify, divide, polarize more. And all the way through Latin America, Whether it's on the left or the right, you get this sense of incredibly divided societies that the the right tend to perceive the left wing governments as though that they're crazy communist Stalinist governments, and the left perceive the right wing governments as though they're neofascist dictatorships. And There is not a center ground, although it doesn't feel like there's a center ground.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's been interesting though how, I think almost without exception, the main leaders Of all the other Latin American countries have come out basically on the side of democracy and on the side of Yeah. Of Lula. Yeah. Even those who disagree with him profoundly on on his These political views. But I look.\n\nI I I think that it signals that, as you say, we we ended the year quite optimistic because Bolsonaro had lost, because Macron won because Schultz was there, because Johnson had gone, because Trump had gone, etcetera. But, you know, if you look at what happened in in congress With the Yep. You you mentioned last week about the speakership. And I bet even when you were talking about that, you didn't imagine it was gonna take in 15 votes.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 0: And the sort of concession that creates amazing crazy people who have now got real power. I read a wonderful piece yesterday on that Salon, the American site. I can't remember the name of the woman who wrote it, but it was basically saying, this is as good as it's gonna get. It's now gonna get worse because these people have been given a taste of real power, And they're not gonna abuse it. And I I you know, I fear for the worst on that.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then you wanted to bring us to the Czech Republic.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think the Czech Republic is really interesting because there's an election this weekend. And Babis, who was prime minister\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: And he's one of the the I think there are 9 candidates.\n\nSpeaker 1: And was narrowly defeated. It was, like, for 23%, 23%, but they got rid of him. Billionaire, Friend of Trump, populist, booted out very unusually because all the opposition parties cobbled together and knocked him out of parliament and being prime minister, but now running to be president.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and there's 3 of them. There's him. I scroll their names down. There's there's him who's the kind of populist Trump Erdogan type figure. Peter Pavel, ex army, and a and a woman who's in her forties, Danusa Narudova, who's the kinda young fresh face.\n\nBut, essentially, it's a populist against 2 kind of seemingly quite reasonable people, but they're all in the twenties and thirties. Yep. And the the and the the electoral system is almost identical to the French. Yep. You have to get 50%, and so it is almost inevitably gonna lead to a runoff.\n\nIf Babis wins, then Putin's happy. Yeah. This guy is very close to\n\nSpeaker 1: To Victor Orban. To Hungary.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's it's also gonna be he he he's somebody who, I think, If he comes back, having been through that process you you've described, and then they that he had this case against him for corruption, which is now one, Nice timing Yep. Has to be said. Yep. So if he comes back, I think that is yet another really quite difficult moment for the euro European Union.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and Final thing before before we close, I want to remind people of, because it it hasn't been much in the media, is Myanmar. So you you'll remember in February of last year, Aung San Suu Kyi's government was toppled by the Burmese military. She won incredible victory in the parliamentary elections. She got nearly 80% of the seats, And the military responded because they were at their very, very weakest by basically a coup d'etat and initially going after on the grounds that she'd owned a walkie talkie and that this was an imprisonable offense.\n\nSpeaker 0: And they've they've just slapped her on her's hands on it,\n\nSpeaker 1: isn't it? 27 years on her, and she's 77 years old. So if that helped, she's never never coming out of jail. But Myanmar is now in the most horrifying situation, 1,400,000 people displaced, Half the country now in the hands of rebel groups, people printing weapons, using three d printing to print weapons to attack the military. Every university in the country closed, the economy collapsing, and this has been going on now for almost 2 years.\n\nSpeaker 0: We pride ourselves on talking about things that Unnecessarily getting that much attention in the in the media. If you defined what the what the junta have done in the last couple of years and just set out the facts of who's been killed, who's been detained, the the sham elections that are coming, and you set it against Putin, you know, they're in the same ballpark. 100%. And yet Nobody's really talking about it at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Extraordinary. 2,500 people killed, 16,000 people detained. Horrifying. Absolutely horrifying. And and I think because this is The Restless Politics podcast, we talk a lot about leadership.\n\nIt it casts a question around Aung San Suu Kyi, who I I knew, And I I'd go to visit her in Myanmar, and I remember sitting with her trying to get her to come out and condemn what the Burmese military were doing to the Rohingya?\n\nSpeaker 0: She she was she couldn't do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: She wouldn't do. And what she said to me was, my position is much more fragile than you realize. To be much more careful criticizing the military than you realize. And at the time, I thought this was disingenuous, that actually she should be taking more risks, she should be challenging the military. Of course, she will feel in the sense that she was vindicated and that we didn't understand.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. But but also she the reason that she made the progress that she did was because she was able to build this network of international support, but there's very little sign of it at the moment. And you had the UN rapporteur, Tom Andrews, last week. He said, we're now witnessing systematic gross human rights violations, which amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity daily against the people of Myanmar. It's not even on the news.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the Chinese and Russians are, of course, vetoing any action The Germany Council.\n\nSpeaker 0: They didn't veto. They abstain, which I thought was interesting. But it's it means that the UN can do something. I thought it was actually surprising they didn't use\n\nSpeaker 1: the do the full veto.\n\nSpeaker 0: The the the general, I don't know how you pronounce him, Min Au Huang, he listed the countries that were on his side this week, China, Thailand, Laos, Bangladesh. Bangladesh has got a 1000000 Rohingya refugees.\n\nSpeaker 1: And the the other countries are sending back refugees. He was a man who controls 2 huge business conglomerates as well as being the head of the military. And when he was in officer training school, he was known by his friends as cat feces.
