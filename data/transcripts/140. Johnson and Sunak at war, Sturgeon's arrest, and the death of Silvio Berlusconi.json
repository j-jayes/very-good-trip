I'm at home In a very summery shirt, I'm feeling quite virtuous and fit having done the great North swim in, Windermere up in your old part of the world. Since when Fiona and I have been going absolute we've been doing an absolute culture vultures in recent days. We've been to the theater three times, Seeing Patriots at the Noel Coward Theatre, which is about Putin and Berezovsky's relationship. Absolutely brilliant. We've seen The Motive in the Queue, which is about John Gielgud directing to Richard Burton in New York in Hamlet in 1964. Sounds very niche, but it is absolutely brilliant. And last night, James Graham, who's Declaring interest, a good friend, probably the best playwright in the country, I'd say, at the moment, and his new play, Dear England, at the National Theatre, which is about Gareth Southgate and penalties. And, honestly, Rory, Even though you know less about football than anybody on the planet, you will really enjoy it, and I think anybody will enjoy it. It's just absolutely brilliant. Oh, thank you. Well, my news, I'm at Naaman, I'm about to fly to Doha this evening when I get off the phone with you, and Shashana has been in Syria And in Afghanistan, and it's it's been fascinating. I mean, I think firstly the Census here at just how tragic things are on the ground in Syria at the moment And how depressing. And then in Afghanistan, oddly encouraging, she was visiting the primary school that we set up together 15 years ago and meeting Female graduates who came back to speak at the school, who've done degrees in chemistry, and it's been really kind of moving. So anyway, that that's We we promised at some point maybe to see if we could get Fiona and Shoshanna on the show, and we should try to do that. Well and, also, we we promised that we'd give some Good news every now and then, and that sounds even in a pretty horrific set of circumstances. She's there on the ground saying things are showing some signs of improvement. That's rather encouraging. So, Rory, as for today, we're gonna talk about Johnson's fallout. I mean, I was really hoping we wouldn't have to talk about him again, But I think that the sense of absolute open warfare now between him and Sunak and this utter nonsense about Nadine Dorys and peerages and interns going to the House of Lords. The whole thing's horrific, but we'll talk about that. I think we should talk about Nicola Sturgeon as well. That was sort of quite big news as we were driving back from Windermere when she was arrested by the investigation into S&P finances. Little retrospective look at the life and times of Silvio Berlusconi, dead at 86. And also you've been saying for a while that we don't talk enough, and you're right about this. We don't talk enough about Latin America, so we're gonna do a little section well, probably quite a big section again on, Latin America, and in particular, relations with, with Beijing and Washington. So do you wanna kick us off with the the whole sort of Johnson Mess. Given that you've got a a lovely, you you enjoy nothing more than the question of Eton, there was a a good letter in In the newspaper from someone called John Claughton, who was a master at Eton, writing in the Times saying, whatever wider strategy Eton adopts, The school will continue to educate the global elite. Perhaps its most important mission will be to ensure that its pupils are saved from the sense of privilege, Entitlement and omniscience that can produce alumni such as Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees Mogg, Quasi Quoting, And therefore damage a country's very fabric. Sadly, I failed in that purpose. John Courten, master Eton College 1984 to 2001. Wow. Very good. Nice letter like that. I mean, I I have to say, Roy, I think it is the inbuilt privilege, etcetera, that, leads to such people thinking that they're entitled as they are. But John level Johnson's levels of entitlement are now reaching barely imaginable that he can he can seriously think There having been kicked out of office by his colleagues who decided that there there would if you remember going back to Downey Street, there were sufficient ministers willing to stay with him, And then a parliamentary committee of his peers deciding that after all, you know what, yes, he is a total liar, and he did lie during COVID, that He somehow thinks that despite all that, one, he's done nothing wrong, 2, he's the victim rather than the cause and the villain of his, in in in his own problems. And 3, that he should be entitled, despite having been by, you and I agree on this, the worst prime minister in our history. He should be entitled to send even more people to the House of Lords than these 25 year old interns and others who've gone off to the House of Lords. And Nadine Dorries, meanwhile, is touring the studio saying that there's been this terrible establishment plot against her. Shi Yu has basically given up being an MP anyway, hasn't been to the commons for god knows how long, barely speaks there, spends most of her time in her own TV studio. And meanwhile, Sunak is sort of pretending that he's standing on a point of principle because he didn't, because some of them weren't allowed by the committee. But I go back to a basic point I've been making for some time. Every single one of these honors had to be signed off by Sunak. He could have said no to the lot of them, and in my view, he should have done. Yeah. I mean, you've you've you've said that from the beginning. I mean, he's he he did more than you thought. I mean, he stopped some of them, which is why we have people like Nadine Dorris Enraged, but definitely some I mean, it's very odd what Boris Johnson and his attitude towards these honors. I mean, I've never seen a prime minister like it. There was a little bit of that going on with previous prime ministers. You know, Tony Blair had to feel felt he had to bring in 400 lords in order to deal with the fact that Conservatives had a a majority in the House of Lords. David Cameron brought brought in about 402, Denis. Hold on, Rory. Hold on. Hold on. Point of information. Point of information. Just for the record, Tony Blair, who was no fan of the honor system, didn't even have a resignation on his list. He just thought, I can't be bothered, and I don't blame him. Good on him. Anyway, there there have been a lot of pretty peculiar people put in the households. There are also some very impressive people. I mean, I I you know, I'm full of admiration for people like, I don't know, Distinguished judges, scientists, the Astronomer Royal, and it's just a real, real pity that an institution which Is the only bit of parliament that actually does serious scrutiny work. I was talking to a civil servant again yesterday who was saying that in their experience of bringing through legislation, In this case, it was on pensions. The House of Commons was a complete waste of time. They never bothered to look at any of the detail, never scrutinize anything. The only thing that really concerned them was the House of Lords, where there really were people who went through things forensically. And, you know, you will have friends in the House of Lords who you admire and who do a really hard, Hard job. But boy, oh, boy, is Johnson, I mean, taking the piss. I mean, it's extraordinary. It's it's it's And it began, but you remember his first thing when he came in as prime minister was to put his brother in the house of lords. Mhmm. But it's as though he's behaving like, like a Berlusconi. Yeah. Well, sort of weird medieval monarch, isn't it? Well, the thing about it, apparently I mean, who knows what's true and what's not true? Because The number 10 version of events does seem to change a little bit from time to time. Rishi Sunak said yesterday that he was asked by Boris Johnson to do something which he did not I think, was the right thing to do. And that, I think, was to overturn or to resist and go back to the House of Lords appointments commission and say, can you look at these again? But also it seems that Boris Johnson was absolutely furious because he'd obviously told his father that he was going to give him a knighthood. And it turns out that somebody in the system, whether it was number 10, whether it was a commission, I don't know, or it was Sunak, said, no. That would be utterly absurd. But I do you know the one that I think is, if anything, the most absurd of all? What what on earth has this young woman, Charlotte Owen, Done to deserve to become a live peer. That means she takes a seat in the House of Lords. She becomes part of our legislator for the rest of her life alongside others who've sort of, you know, helped Johnson through his useless premiership. She's 29. She's got a two one in politics and international relations from to of York. And her main c v the the main points of her CV has been that she's been an intern and a parliamentary assistant to a succession of conservative MPs. Now, honestly, I can you explain to me how that justifies a peerage? It it's totally a submachine. No. No. I think he's, I I Sometimes think that he's deliberately trying to bring the whole house down around his head. I mean, he's he's doing things so provocative, like, I mean, partly, you know, putting his brother in the House of Lords, giving his father a knighthood is very out of central casting for some of these kind of Edward the 2nd medieval monarch types With their favorites and their families and that. But it's really, really weird. And I think some of these appointments are sort of him just thumbing his nose at the establishment and trying to discredit the whole thing as he does it. If people want to look on Twitter, there's a a writer called Nicholas Shakespeare who's just written a very good book on Ian Fleming, But who absolutely specializes in brutal takedowns of Boris Johnson and has collected The greatest articles written on Boris Johnson over the last few days, and he picks out, Anthony Seldon in The Times, who says his inner emptiness made it imperative to be the center of attention. Not a single person whom he encountered in his life has not been cheapened or damaged by their association with them. And then, Matthew Said, I can't help thinking that the UK has, in certain respects, Taken the qualities of the former PM, his deceptiveness entered the body politic like a poison, and finally, Max Hastings, He's perhaps the most selfish human being I've ever met, indifferent to the welfare of anyone save himself. It's Striking that he has few, if any, personal friends. He demands loyalty, but is incapable of giving it to others. But you know what? You mentioned Anthony Seldon there, of course, has written this book about Johnson. And Robert Saunders, who is on social media, is at red historian. He I'm grateful to David Miliband for this because David sent this to me. He spotted it. Robert Saunders has written a very, very, very, very long thread on social media, which we'll put in the notes, pointing to very, very long list of statements made in the past in his writings by Anthony Seldon, essentially saying what a marvelous chap Boris Johnson was as he rose through the ranks. So I do think that it's all very well. At least some of us have been consistent from the word A go that this guy should never be listen. There's another one in the House of Lords Ray. This is I've just I've just looked up Ross Kemptsall, who is heading to the, The House of Lords. So this is his entire Wikipedia entry. It won't take me long to read it. Ross John Kemptsell, Born 1991 or 1992. My assessment is if the Wikipedia can't be bothered to say when exactly you were born, then you're really not built up to much. He's a British political adviser who is political director of the Conservative Party and director of the conservative research department. He was given a live peerage in the prime minister's resignation honors. Khemsel was educated at the Blar, where he wrote for the Weekly Student Newspaper Varsity. He is a former journalist at the Guy Don Forks political website. In 2019, KEMSOLE interviewed Boris Johnson during his campaign for the leadership of the conservative party in which Johnson declared that he liked to make models of buses to relax. He also worked as a journalist for Times Radio and was political editor for Talk Radio. That is it. That is his life on Wikipedia, and he has been sent to the House of Lords by Boris, Consumerly for services to interviews about how to make model buses to relax. Can I ask 1 question? So one of the things that you've been picking up in our podcast A lot is that Boris Johnson was very keen to put Paul Daker, the editor of the Daily Mail, in fact, so much so that he put him in one honest list. It was rejected by the appointments commission. In March, he put him back on the honest list. Am I right in saying, though, that this is something that Rishi Sunak did ultimately manage to prevent, that Paul Daker has not become a lord? Well, Paul Daker has not become a lord, and and and that is great news for the world because it's the one thing above all else that he wanted and a man who's done as much damage to our public debate as Daker shouldn't be given anything that he wants. But Rishi Sunak's line is The the the apparently, there have been 8 people who've been rejected by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Now it is an absolute failure of modern journalism that we don't yet Know the names of these 8, but I suspect over time, we will hopefully find out they who they are. I really do hope that, that Dayko is one of them, people saying it is. I'm assuming Nadine Dorries is another. I'm assuming Alex Sharma is another. I don't know whether that guy Adams, who's provoked this 3rd by election. But, honestly, Rory, what does it say about our country that this is I was flicking through my German news websites as I do every Every evening last night, when I go back in the theater, and this this this this story there about this is the row the row between Sunak and Johnson about whether his dad should be called sir And Lee, I mean, we're just a joke at the moment. I mean, it it's beyond imagining. It's absolutely beyond imagining. In fact, so disturbing. Unfortunately, north of the border, we now have something else going on which is really peculiar, which is Nicola Sturgeon was put in custody. I mean, the police actually took her into custody and then released her again, and That's an incredible thing. So just to quickly remind people of this story, this relates to a police investigation into 6 160,000 pounds of donations that went to the SNP that seem, in some way, to, well, something's gone wrong with them, We have to be a bit careful here on on not getting ourselves sued or put in prison ourselves, but, anyway, that's what the police are investigating. And Amongst the people they've started investigating were Peter Marrow, who is Nicola Sturgeon's husband, who we talked about this too, in an incredible conflict of interest, he was this chief executive of the SMP at the same time as she was the 1st minister in Scotland. So he's been, interviewed by the police. She's been interviewed by the police. There's been this stuff about some kind of mobile home that was bought, which was seized from her His parents' house? Also, the the the party treasurer has also been interviewed by police. All 3 have been interviewed and released without charge. Now at the risk of my, Scottish Labour friends shouting at me as they have in the past for being far too in touch to Nicola Sturgeon, I think we should make clear she was released without charge. No charges have been have been brought forward. And Police Scotland have been very, very clear That all of us, you know, and that includes us, Rory, should be very, very careful about how we discuss what is clearly a live investigation. Very good. I was talking to, you get some amazing people in the in the swimming pool that I go to, but one of them was a a judge. And, I was I was sort of asking about this thing. I said, why why couldn't this have been done? Why do these things have to be done with this sort of process of arrest and taken to the station and so forth. And he was saying it's partly to do with taping. They have the equipment there to tape everything. But it's also that they they want to give people the police in this sort of investigation want to give people a real sense of the seriousness of it. But I I think it is. It's a it's a pretty, it's a pretty astonishing, turn of events. One of the big things happening in the SMP Is there a huge cause including from one of the last leadership candidates to have her suspended? Partly because Nicola Sturgeon was actually famous for Frequently suspending or removing the whip from any other SNP politician who faced police investigations, and there's a great list of them on the BBC. So Alex Salmond quit the party in 2018. You remember he was tried and cleared at trial of sexually assaulting 9 women. Yeah. Patrick Grady was suspended from the party for making another MP for making a sexual advance to a teenage member of staff. Former might finance minister Derek Mackie was suspended for messaging a 16 year old boy on social media. Margaret Ferrier lost the S&P whip after speaking in the Westminster Parliament while awaiting the results for COVID tests in September 2020 before traveling back by train to Glasgow without, Self isolating. And another former SMP MP, Natalie McGarry, was sentenced to 2 years in jail for embezzling £25,000 from the SMP. It's It's quite a long list, isn't it? It's quite a long list, and and and and I think, you know, one of the things that obviously Nicola Sturgeon was doing by suspending these things quickly was To try to say this is not a tiny, cozy set of people, but it's striking that Hamzah Yusuf hasn't done What I guess you would advise him to do, which was suspend her straight away until the results became clear. Or is that not your advice? What what do you think you should do? I was aware of some of those cases that you mentioned. I wasn't aware of them all. It does suggest that that was the approach. He is obviously Hamza Yousef is obviously taking a a very different precedent. Because he said in an interview on the back of this when he was under, as you say, under pressure from a lot of people to suspend Nicola Nicola Sturgeon. He said, I'm not suspending Nicola's membership. I'm treating her in the same way that I've treated, for example, Colin Beatty. Now Colin Beatty is the aforementioned former S&P treasurer who was has already been, arrested and released without charge. So he's decided that is the precedent he wants. He says, those that have been released without charge, I see no reason to suspend their membership. So that says that he's decided he will suspend them from the party if and when This escalates further. But, look, I I do I do feel a bit sorry for him, to be honest. I mean, he is what a total mess he has now inherited. And every time he tries to get onto the front foot and speak about something else, there's something else is popping up to kind of knock him down. So my friend, Angus MacNeill, who's, from the Highlands and Islands, who I used to go canoeing with on the Thames, he was, he was like, he's a Gallic speaker, isn't he? He's a Gallic speaker And he was he was a friend of mine in parliament. So he's been out saying, this soap opera has gone far enough. Nicholas Sturchin suspended others from the SMP for an awful lot less. So I guess Angus MacNeil would be appealing to you as a former expert on communications saying that he thinks the longer she remains, the more the soap opera continues, and he thinks it's necessary to move fast to cauterize this by suspending it. The only thing I'd say to that is that I think that when you're talking about a former first minister And you talk about somebody as well known as Nicola Sturgeon, I think it moves to a completely different level when it involves Police Scotland making these inquiries. So I think look. What happens now is what's important in terms of the that that police investigation rather than some sort of short term tactical thing that Jose Yousef tries to do. So, look, I I'm I'm guessing that what he what Angus is saying there about This is part of this. What I think has become clear since Nicola Sturgeon left is that the divisions within the SMP, Both personality and policy and political are much deeper than maybe you and I, looking in from the outside, were aware because the sense we got the whole time was that Nicola Sturgeon had a really tight grip of the whole party pretty much. Yeah. It's amazing. I I've In reading David Torrance's biography of Nicola Sturgeon, he also read a a biography of Alex Salmond, and it's it's very striking. He wrote it Just after the Brexit referendum when she was absolutely at her peak, because after the referendum, she came out very, very clearly. She was celebrated internationally for being the 1 leader with a very clear view in Britain about how to respond to the referendum And it's an extraordinary story. It's the story of somebody who was a very, very hardworking girl from a Tough working class background in Ayrshire who got to Glasgow University was fanatically interested in politics, in SMP politics from the age 16 onwards, she'd spent her holidays at SMP youth camps, and her first, connection with Peter Morell, now her husband, former chief executive of the SMP was that he was running SMP Communications and put her on television at the age of 18. That was her first, Appearance because he already spotted the talent, and somebody who was initially far to the left of you, she was disgusted by Neil Kinnock, for example, She thought he was far too right wing. She very much on the kind of Benite side of things, and, you know, very much CND was incredibly important to her. That strand exists still in the SMP, and I think that's the the thing that she's managed to straddle pretty well. But I think there's no doubt she's been a very, very significant political figure and has been viewed widely as a very, very effective politician. But the big thing that she's fought for all her life looks to me like it's less likely to happen than it than it did. And, obviously, her statement was very, very strong. I'm confident I haven't done anything wrong, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So that's why I say, ultimately, Where this case now goes will decide her legacy as much as anything. Well, as as we move to the break, we're about to move on to Another major political figure who had a lot to do with the police and courts, Silvio Berlusconi, who claimed to have appeared In over 30 court cases and appeared in the witness stands, he claimed 2,000 times, but his relationship with the truth was always a bit peculiar, and we'll return to that after the break. So So welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell. And with me, Rory Stewart. And, Alastair, what one of the things that we wanted to just touch on is is we did this Interview with Kate Raworth who's an economist who, developed the cider of doughnut economics, which people can listen to on The Rest is Politics Leading. Kate Kate Ray, what's what what did you think of that interview? Well, it seems to have gone down very, very well. Marsalafora on Twitter. Because we said in our discussion afterwards that we both, I think, found something utterly compelling about her vision and the need for the chain the scale of change required, but But we just couldn't quite see how to make it happen politically. But I'll tell you, I don't know if you've been following this. I'm gonna just hold this so you can see it, and we'll we'll put it in the, The show notes as well. Have you seen these graphs on the temperatures of the water in the the Atlantic, which are just absolutely terrifying? So, essentially, the the the it's a graph that shows that water temperatures are rising way higher than they should be. And She was talking about, you know, the dangers of actually reaching sort of tipping point. You look at stuff like this, and it's just terrifying. And I'll tell you the other thing I think is interesting. I do think there's It's important that at some point, those people like her, who are utterly, you know, not single issue because it's everything, but, you know, Absolutely fixated, fanatical, and I use these words in a positive way, campaigning on something as important as that. But it but understanding that you have to, at some stage, engage properly with the political process, and I guess that's where you and I can maybe, I don't know. Help do more. I don't know. By by demonstrating the world weary cynicism of the political process. I know. And you getting on another bloody airplane today as well. Exactly. That's it. That's it. Quite right. Now we are now gonna move on to the amazing Story of Silvio Budaskoni, who you met. Right? I met many times. Yeah. Absolutely. I wanna really hear about that, but I'm just just for the sake Of listeners, just to remind them a little bit about Berlusconi. Berlusconi, born in 1936, so he was born in Mussolini's, Italy. He Started life as a law student. He was a very, very keen singer. Famously he was a crooner on cruise ships, And he then went, firstly, into real estate development where he built these enormous sort of interconnected 19 seventies futuristic, skyscrapers for 4,000 people connected by weird bridges then set up a television company initially serving his Skyscrapers and exploited the fact that Italy was a pretty conservative lockdown place in the 19 seventies, early Tinnatees and their equivalent to the BBC was a very, very prim Catholic broadcaster and he pioneered Essentially, women, with their tops off and, entertainment shows and eventually managed to persuade an An Italian prime minister in the early 19 eighties to pass emergency legislation allowing his shows to be shown through the country and ended up controlling 90%, literally 90% of Italy's television. And he used this position to go Onto I bet you'll tell us a bit about this too. He he owned AC Milan. Mhmm. He he wrote the theme tune for AC Milan, thus getting into a sort of musical theme. He co he co wrote it. He co wrote it with a proper writer. And then in 1994, he decided to go into politics. And Using his incredible television platform, he got 50 of the advertising executives on his company to also stand with him, used his Coverage of 90% of Italian TV to get himself, and then eventually, his 50 advertising executives elected, became PM in 94, Served 94 to 95. Prime minister again, 2001 to 2006, which was very important because he came in behind George Bush in the Iraq war. And then again, 2008 to 2011. And the reason we're just talking about him is he's just died. But over to you, who has some personal experience of the man? Well, he he's, he is a a truly extraordinary figure of our times. And I was doing, an interview with CNN yesterday about my book As It Happened, but but because of Trump in the indictment and Johnson going through his troubles, they wanted to talk about the whole sort of populism thing. And the researcher had done his, done his work because they flashed up a quote from the book as follows. When it comes to the use of post truth strategies in Western democracies, perhaps the first big mover was the media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. I think he is in many ways a precursor of Trump and of Johnson. And I think what he did, which was Incredibly clever. If if his aim was always to go into politics, which I suspect it was and he once said to somebody, by the way, that the first time he went into politics, It was to avoid landing himself in a terrible court case where he thought he was gonna go to jail. So he basically understood, as many politicians have, That getting good media on your side is very, very helpful in politics, but he did it completely differently. He created this media landscape, as you say, with 90% control and then went into politics. And that 90%, you're you're talking almost kind of authoritarian levels of of media control. And the other thing he was, he became the showman. He was an ink, You know, he was a crooner. I actually think he's one of those guys who was much better looking before he had all the plastic surgery. I think he was actually a very good looking Young man, apparently, he was quite a good singer. I want I did hear him sing once, but only in a kind of he was messing around sort of way. But he then became this great showman. The football was a part of that. You know, football Italy is a pretty football crazy country. AC Milan. He owned AC Milan from 1986 to 2017. They had a lot of success during that period. So that made him popular. The TV stuff made him popular. And this kind of populist blokey, The whole banga banga party staying a little bit. Interrupt, tell people what the banga banga party is. I thought you'd be interested in banga bungas. So banga banga parties Were his names for these parties where he had an enormous number of young women gathered at a villa, and it came to public attention because one of these women was arrested by the police, And he managed to get her off by telephoning the Italian police and telling them that she was the niece of, I think, the president of Morocco or something, And that it was incredibly embarrassing to create a diplomatic incident, and she was then released. She subsequently, claimed that he never slept with her and that it was all very innocent, And, he was just a lonely old man who likes having 17 year old girls performing in parties Well, one of one of his wives did make a very Volley will complain about his seeming predilection for very young women, which seems to have lasted his entire life. Part of his whole identity, wasn't it? I mean, he was, Totally. I suppose a bit like a lot of populous leaders. I mean, it's part of, I guess, what initially appealed to people about Boris Johnson, which is His kind of off color humor that he would make these kind of bar jokes all the time. I mean, some of them were completely Extraordinary. Someone, you know, more straightforward, he would say, come and invest in Italy because we have the most beautiful secretaries in the world. But then he would compare, you know, a German member of the European Parliament. He he would say, she looks like the kind of person who'd work in a Nazi concentration camp. Have I said alright. I I I'll I'll tell you my my favorite Berlusconi story. So NATO summit, Berlusconi has he because remember, he was prime minister, I think, in total for 9 years. He was prime minister through 4 different governments of varying length. But at one point, he became Italy took on the rotating presidency of NATO. He hadn't been prime minister that long, and he made this sort of amazing speech about NATO and the power of NATO or the transatlantic alliance and the relationship with America. And it was very, very, very pro American, very pro NATO. And as you said earlier, he was, you know, he supported George Bush on the the Iraq war, and he and he was very Atlanticist when it came to security. Jack Chirac was sitting there getting grumpier and grumpier and grumpier as Berlusconi became more and more sort of florid in his pro NATO statements. And so Chirac very loudly demanded to be the next speaker. And, of course, he was quite a senior dude, so Presses his his, microphone and the lights on and there's Chirac speaking. Chirac then starts to give Berlusconi A rather gentle at first, but then getting less gentle taste of his opinion as to why, you know, Europe is where his heart should be and All this stuff about, you know, NATO, let's not lose sight of Europe, and da da da da da da da da. At which point, Silvio Berdisconi sort of clicks his fingers. And this is the bit I'm not sure. I think I have to describe it in this way because it is relevant to the story. A truly stunning Young woman, who was clearly one of Italy's most renowned models, suddenly walked into the room, Walked around the room, and I have to say, I think virtually every single person in that room, male or female, was looking at this incredibly beautiful woman walking into the room. And she went over to Berlusconi, And she whispered into his ear, and he turned to her and whispered into his ear. And then she went out of the room, and she came back while Churak was still speaking away With fewer and fewer people listening, she came back with a tray of watches. These watches which were then sort of being offered to the various leaders around the table. So all all guaranteed to make sure that as Chirac because making his serious speech, nobody was paying any attention at all because they were all looking at the woman or the watch. They were looking they were looking, first of all, at the woman, but, allegedly, they were looking at the watch, and then they were trying on the watches. So, yeah, he was but I'll tell you what. The the one thing I would say where I think, you know, we can maybe laugh about that kind of thing, But he was also a precursor to Trump and Johnson and Putin, if you like, in the constant undermining of the rule of law. I mean, the whole thing about he used politics to change laws to help him get out of legal situations that he was in. And and he totally and and and, of course, Used politics completely to, for conflict of interest reasons for his own media and political empires. Absolutely. I mean, he he was a very, very Strange, disturbing figure, and I think he he, you know, at some points, he'd pay tribute to Mussolini. He clearly had, like Trump, an incredible chip on his shoulder about what he perceived as the establishment. So even though, like Trump, he's a billionaire, both of them are property billionaires, But both of them felt the establishment never took them seriously. He he was always known as Cavalieri. He he had he had got this sort of Dodgy knighthood, which he'd eventually given up. But I think a lot of his life was about feeling weirdly that he was the kind of underdog Fighting against, the kind of sneering. And someone like Chirac would have really, I guess, wound him up because he would have represented the kind of great The sort of French intellectual talking down at him. Yeah. He he's, I hadn't really thought of him that respect because he always emanated A sense of incredible self confidence, and and he had a real kind of look at me feel to him. But you could be right. Maybe because his his background, I think, was Quite. His dad was a fairly lowly bank official. His his his mom, I I think, was was a housewife who just looked after him and the family. If you sort of look up Berlusconi, I guess this is inevitable given the the role of organized crime in its Italian history. But, you know, the links with the mafia, there there's always that sense of, You know, how close he was or wasn't to to organized crime. Well, because del Lutri, who was the cofounder of Forza Italia, with him was eventually sent to jail for 9 years for his mafia links. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of questions about where I mean, it it's the same, With that horrifying figure in the United States, Jeffrey Epstein, with both of them, there are huge questions about where they got their first money from. People can sort of understand the logic of how he managed to use the money he made from his 4,000 apartment blocks into building media empire. What's much less, Kier, is where on earth he got the money from to start? Well, apparently, it's it's reckoned that I mean, the the various Assessments you see is that he's worth somewhere between $6,000,000,000. So he's got I think he's got 5 children between 2 different women. So they all stand to gain a a fair few, Bob. The favorite little fact that I didn't know until I saw the some of the obituaries is that he was a freemason, and his lodge was called if I think if I was a freemason, this is the the lodge that I would join. It was called Propaganda Due. Propaganda Due. Propaganda Due Lodge is was was per S. Cody's Lodge. Very it's a very it's a good fact. Okay. Now we we don't have much time left, Pankaj, so we wanted to touch briefly on Latin America. And You've been looking at something called the lithium triangle and relationships with China. And obviously we'll have chances to come back to Latin America in more depth on other Pods because we don't do enough on Latin America, but I'd love to hear from you a bit on what you've been finding out. Well, this was your idea, really, to to say, you know, we didn't really talk about Latin America much. But Think that, you know, we've talked about Africa, and you've got a lot of experience of Africa. And it seems to me that during the Cold War, There wasn't that much interest being paid to Latin America, particularly by by China. And I can't remember who it was, but somebody came up with the the the idea that we've gone from the cold war to a cold piece. And that the and that China has actually been very, very, very systematic about developing relations in in Latin America. It was Richard Richard Haas, who's the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. He says he's he's got this view that power is now spreading to a greater number of actors in the geopolitical space and that Latin America is a a target for that. And you probably heard this phrase about geopolitical swing states. You know, we all know what a swing state is in the the American electoral context, But there are now geopolitical swing states who basically, they're not necessarily pro this side or pro that side. They're making calculations according to their own, sometimes commercial, sometimes strategic interests. And, you know, the lithium triangle is essentially lithium is such an important commodity for batteries, for cars, for transferring to renewables, and so forth. And Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia right up there in terms of possessing the lithium that other nations, in particular, the Chinese want, because the Chinese then have the capacity to to take it and do with it what they will. So I just think that you're seeing far more attention from China from America, interestingly, how, you know, America is starting to look slightly different than Venezuela in recent months. And so So I think there's a lot going on there. Yeah. I mean, one of the things that we've we've talked about in the podcast, and I was I mean, looking at the kind of big six, so, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia. You can see that there's a kind of, obviously there's a there's a pattern that many, many countries around the world have followed, but it's maybe more dramatic in Latin America than elsewhere, which broadly speaking feels like A cold war history, often military governments, and then as they moved from the late eighties into the early nineties, the emergence of these kinds of Technocratic Washington consensus new president. So in Brazil, Cardoso, who's an intellectual, In Argentina, MENEM, in Chile, Largo, in Peru, Fujimori, in Colombia, maybe Uribe, in Mexico, Zedillo. And there's this credible boom largely driven by commodities, which means that they're not hit as hard by the 2008 financial crisis As Europe or the United States are. But what hits them is the commodity crash in about 2014, and it's from then onwards That you see these populous governments emerging. I mean, dramatically, as we've talked about, on the right, Bolsonaro in Brazil, But we've also talked about the left wing populists Absolutely. Emerged. So Borics, for example, Gustavo Petro, Obrador, Pedro Castillo. And I I think it I mean, maybe this is where your friend who brought us the three p's of What is his name? Yeah. Populism post truth polarization. His book really begins in Latin America, doesn't it? And sees that this phenomenon is being something that Latin America explores first. Yeah. There's there's there's another book, I'd mentioned in which he actually he does feature. And it's a very staged title, but it's it's worth looking at. It's It's called China and Latin America Development Agency in Geopolitics, and it's written by Christopher Alden and a guy called Alvaro Mendez. And it's literally it is literally that, a history of relations between China and Latin America. And the turning point seems to have been Deng Xiaoping in the late seventies and the whole sort of reform reform program. And the restoration of diplomatic links that, frankly, during the previous era, had just been sort of virtually untouched. And and the the in interestingly, the the country that really seems to have sort of Led this in a way was Peru. And, there was a new Peru China trade agreement in 2009, and that led to sort of, you know, massive new foreign direct investment. Argentina, obviously hugely important. They've got an election coming up this year, but but part of the debate in that has been, Are we America? Are we China? And, obviously, Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, biggest population, lots of, natural resources and so forth. And Lula, interestingly, has been out to China quite recently, and they're talking about this big big partnership on a satellite. Yeah. So this is related to the Belt and Road Initiative, which is this amazing Chinese infrastructure investment, $4,000,000,000,000 worth, Which you see a lot of in Africa, you've seen in Pakistan and in Latin America, which is about building an incredible network of Infrastructure from dams, ports, roads, bridges and actually has even had European and East European out sheets as people have signed up to the Belt and Road Initiative. It's a sort of Chinese massive soft power play with an enormous amount of development finance behind it. No. And that's exactly what it is. And and the point is that in the past, a lot of Chinese diplomacy is being conducted through stealth, And they're now out there very, very open, openly inviting partners in Central and South America in the in the in the Belt and Road Initiative. They've got this new partnership with the community of Latin American and Caribbean states. And China's now become South America's 1st trading partner, Largest source of financing in space, infrastructure, energy, 2,700 major China funded companies operating around the place. And the other thing that's interesting that comes out in this in the in the book that I mentioned, China and Latin America, is that the that experience of African countries of, in a sense, being drawn into development traps linked to growing external debt. There is obviously the worry that that is gonna be replicated across Latin America. Listen. Just as we come to, and I'd like to plug A guy called Michael Reed who's written a very good book called forgotten continent, who I think was at The Economist, but, anyway, a a British journalist who's who's done some brilliant work on Latin America. Good. Well, okay. We should call it a day then. Well, thank you all very, very much. Well, thank you in particular, not all of you. Well, I also the team. But, Yeah. Thank you to the team. Thank you to our producers. We don't thank enough. And also, thank you to you. Alright, Roy. Speak to you soon.",

And I'm really excited to see people in Bath and Edinburgh. And tiny plug for me again, which is anybody in the Manchester area wants to come along. I'm doing a solo thing on 2nd September in the Lowry, and I will be doing sterling work signing, but I believe Alastair will also be prepared To be signing a little bit, so there'll be a a double opportunity, the 2 of us sitting next to each other at the desks.\n\nSpeaker 0: So presale tickets to these shows for members of the rest of SportagePlus are on sale right now.

We'll tweet the ticket link from the Restless Politics Twitter account At rest, it's politics at exactly 9 AM on Friday. Now, Alastair, tell us where you are and what you've been up to.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm at home In a very summery shirt, I'm feeling quite virtuous and fit having done the great North swim in, Windermere up in your old part of the world. Since when Fiona and I have been going absolute we've been doing an absolute culture vultures in recent days. We've been to the theater three times, Seeing Patriots at the Noel Coward Theatre, which is about Putin and Berezovsky's relationship. Absolutely brilliant. We've seen The Motive in the Queue, which is about John Gielgud directing to Richard Burton in New York in Hamlet in 1964.\n\nSounds very niche, but it is absolutely brilliant. And last night, James Graham, who's Declaring interest, a good friend, probably the best playwright in the country, I'd say, at the moment, and his new play, Dear England, at the National Theatre, which is about Gareth Southgate and penalties. And, honestly, Rory, Even though you know less about football than anybody on the planet, you will really enjoy it, and I think anybody will enjoy it. It's just absolutely brilliant.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you. Well, my news, I'm at Naaman, I'm about to fly to Doha this evening when I get off the phone with you, and Shashana has been in Syria And in Afghanistan, and it's it's been fascinating. I mean, I think firstly the Census here at just how tragic things are on the ground in Syria at the moment And how depressing. And then in Afghanistan, oddly encouraging, she was visiting the primary school that we set up together 15 years ago and meeting Female graduates who came back to speak at the school, who've done degrees in chemistry, and it's been really kind of moving. So anyway, that that's We we promised at some point maybe to see if we could get Fiona and Shoshanna on the show, and we should try to do that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well and, also, we we promised that we'd give some Good news every now and then, and that sounds even in a pretty horrific set of circumstances. She's there on the ground saying things are showing some signs of improvement. That's rather encouraging. So, Rory, as for today, we're gonna talk about Johnson's fallout. I mean, I was really hoping we wouldn't have to talk about him again, But I think that the sense of absolute open warfare now between him and Sunak and this utter nonsense about Nadine Dorys and peerages and interns going to the House of Lords.\n\nThe whole thing's horrific, but we'll talk about that. I think we should talk about Nicola Sturgeon as well. That was sort of quite big news as we were driving back from Windermere when she was arrested by the investigation into S&P finances. Little retrospective look at the life and times of Silvio Berlusconi, dead at 86. And also you've been saying for a while that we don't talk enough, and you're right about this.\n\nWe don't talk enough about Latin America, so we're gonna do a little section well, probably quite a big section again on, Latin America, and in particular, relations with, with Beijing and Washington. So do you wanna kick us off with the the whole sort of Johnson Mess.\n\nSpeaker 1: Given that you've got a a lovely, you you enjoy nothing more than the question of Eton, there was a a good letter in In the newspaper from someone called John Claughton, who was a master at Eton, writing in the Times saying, whatever wider strategy Eton adopts, The school will continue to educate the global elite. Perhaps its most important mission will be to ensure that its pupils are saved from the sense of privilege, Entitlement and omniscience that can produce alumni such as Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees Mogg, Quasi Quoting, And therefore damage a country's very fabric. Sadly, I failed in that purpose. John Courten, master Eton College 1984 to 2001.\n\nSpeaker 0: Wow. Very good. Nice letter like that. I mean, I I have to say, Roy, I think it is the inbuilt privilege, etcetera, that, leads to such people thinking that they're entitled as they are. But John level Johnson's levels of entitlement are now reaching barely imaginable that he can he can seriously think There having been kicked out of office by his colleagues who decided that there there would if you remember going back to Downey Street, there were sufficient ministers willing to stay with him, And then a parliamentary committee of his peers deciding that after all, you know what, yes, he is a total liar, and he did lie during COVID, that He somehow thinks that despite all that, one, he's done nothing wrong, 2, he's the victim rather than the cause and the villain of his, in in in his own problems.\n\nAnd 3, that he should be entitled, despite having been by, you and I agree on this, the worst prime minister in our history. He should be entitled to send even more people to the House of Lords than these 25 year old interns and others who've gone off to the House of Lords. And Nadine Dorries, meanwhile, is touring the studio saying that there's been this terrible establishment plot against her. Shi Yu has basically given up being an MP anyway, hasn't been to the commons for god knows how long, barely speaks there, spends most of her time in her own TV studio. And meanwhile, Sunak is sort of pretending that he's standing on a point of principle because he didn't, because some of them weren't allowed by the committee.\n\nBut I go back to a basic point I've been making for some time. Every single one of these honors had to be signed off by Sunak. He could have said no to the lot of them, and in my view, he should have done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, you've you've you've said that from the beginning. I mean, he's he he did more than you thought. I mean, he stopped some of them, which is why we have people like Nadine Dorris Enraged, but definitely some I mean, it's very odd what Boris Johnson and his attitude towards these honors. I mean, I've never seen a prime minister like it.\n\nThere was a little bit of that going on with previous prime ministers. You know, Tony Blair had to feel felt he had to bring in 400 lords in order to deal with the fact that Conservatives had a a majority in the House of Lords. David Cameron brought brought in about 402, Denis.\n\nSpeaker 0: Hold on, Rory. Hold on. Hold on. Point of information. Point of information.\n\nJust for the record, Tony Blair, who was no fan of the honor system, didn't even have a resignation on his list. He just thought, I can't be bothered, and I don't blame him.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good on him. Anyway, there there have been a lot of pretty peculiar people put in the households. There are also some very impressive people. I mean, I I you know, I'm full of admiration for people like, I don't know, Distinguished judges, scientists, the Astronomer Royal, and it's just a real, real pity that an institution which Is the only bit of parliament that actually does serious scrutiny work. I was talking to a civil servant again yesterday who was saying that in their experience of bringing through legislation, In this case, it was on pensions.\n\nThe House of Commons was a complete waste of time. They never bothered to look at any of the detail, never scrutinize anything. The only thing that really concerned them was the House of Lords, where there really were people who went through things forensically. And, you know, you will have friends in the House of Lords who you admire and who do a really hard, Hard job. But boy, oh, boy, is Johnson, I mean, taking the piss.\n\nI mean, it's extraordinary. It's it's it's And it began, but you remember his first thing when he came in as prime minister was to put his brother in the house of lords.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's as though he's behaving like,\n\nSpeaker 0: like a Berlusconi.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, sort of weird medieval monarch, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, the thing about it, apparently I mean, who knows what's true and what's not true? Because The number 10 version of events does seem to change a little bit from time to time. Rishi Sunak said yesterday that he was asked by Boris Johnson to do something which he did not I think, was the right thing to do. And that, I think, was to overturn or to resist and go back to the House of Lords appointments commission and say, can you look at these again? But also it seems that Boris Johnson was absolutely furious because he'd obviously told his father that he was going to give him a knighthood.\n\nAnd it turns out that somebody in the system, whether it was number 10, whether it was a commission, I don't know, or it was Sunak, said, no. That would be utterly absurd. But I do you know the one that I think is, if anything, the most absurd of all? What what on earth has this young woman, Charlotte Owen, Done to deserve to become a live peer. That means she takes a seat in the House of Lords.\n\nShe becomes part of our legislator for the rest of her life alongside others who've sort of, you know, helped Johnson through his useless premiership. She's 29. She's got a two one in politics and international relations from to of York. And her main c v the the main points of her CV has been that she's been an intern and a parliamentary assistant to a succession of conservative MPs. Now, honestly, I can you explain to me how that justifies a peerage?\n\nSpeaker 1: It it's totally a submachine. No. No. I think he's, I I Sometimes think that he's deliberately trying to bring the whole house down around his head. I mean, he's he's doing things so provocative, like, I mean, partly, you know, putting his brother in the House of Lords, giving his father a knighthood is very out of central casting for some of these kind of Edward the 2nd medieval monarch types With their favorites and their families and that.\n\nBut it's really, really weird. And I think some of these appointments are sort of him just thumbing his nose at the establishment and trying to discredit the whole thing as he does it. If people want to look on Twitter, there's a a writer called Nicholas Shakespeare who's just written a very good book on Ian Fleming, But who absolutely specializes in brutal takedowns of Boris Johnson and has collected The greatest articles written on Boris Johnson over the last few days, and he picks out, Anthony Seldon in The Times, who says his inner emptiness made it imperative to be the center of attention. Not a single person whom he encountered in his life has not been cheapened or damaged by their association with them. And then, Matthew Said, I can't help thinking that the UK has, in certain respects, Taken the qualities of the former PM, his deceptiveness entered the body politic like a poison, and finally, Max Hastings, He's perhaps the most selfish human being I've ever met, indifferent to the welfare of anyone save himself.\n\nIt's Striking that he has few, if any, personal friends. He demands loyalty, but is incapable of giving it to others.\n\nSpeaker 0: But you know what? You mentioned Anthony Seldon there, of course, has written this book about Johnson. And Robert Saunders, who is on social media, is at red historian. He I'm grateful to David Miliband for this because David sent this to me. He spotted it.\n\nRobert Saunders has written a very, very, very, very long thread on social media, which we'll put in the notes, pointing to very, very long list of statements made in the past in his writings by Anthony Seldon, essentially saying what a marvelous chap Boris Johnson was as he rose through the ranks. So I do think that it's all very well. At least some of us have been consistent from the word A go that this guy should never be listen. There's another one in the House of Lords Ray. This is I've just I've just looked up Ross Kemptsall, who is heading to the, The House of Lords.\n\nSo this is his entire Wikipedia entry. It won't take me long to read it. Ross John Kemptsell, Born 1991 or 1992. My assessment is if the Wikipedia can't be bothered to say when exactly you were born, then you're really not built up to much. He's a British political adviser who is political director of the Conservative Party and director of the conservative research department.\n\nHe was given a live peerage in the prime minister's resignation honors. Khemsel was educated at the Blar, where he wrote for the Weekly Student Newspaper Varsity. He is a former journalist at the Guy Don Forks political website. In 2019, KEMSOLE interviewed Boris Johnson during his campaign for the leadership of the conservative party in which Johnson declared that he liked to make models of buses to relax. He also worked as a journalist for Times Radio and was political editor for Talk Radio.\n\nThat is it. That is his life on Wikipedia, and he has been sent to the House of Lords by Boris, Consumerly for services to interviews about how to make model buses to relax.\n\nSpeaker 1: Can I ask 1 question? So one of the things that you've been picking up in our podcast A lot is that Boris Johnson was very keen to put Paul Daker, the editor of the Daily Mail, in fact, so much so that he put him in one honest list. It was rejected by the appointments commission. In March, he put him back on the honest list. Am I right in saying, though, that this is something that Rishi Sunak did ultimately manage to prevent, that Paul Daker has not become a lord?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Paul Daker has not become a lord, and and and that is great news for the world because it's the one thing above all else that he wanted and a man who's done as much damage to our public debate as Daker shouldn't be given anything that he wants. But Rishi Sunak's line is The the the apparently, there have been 8 people who've been rejected by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Now it is an absolute failure of modern journalism that we don't yet Know the names of these 8, but I suspect over time, we will hopefully find out they who they are. I really do hope that, that Dayko is one of them, people saying it is. I'm assuming Nadine Dorries is another.\n\nI'm assuming Alex Sharma is another. I don't know whether that guy Adams, who's provoked this 3rd by election. But, honestly, Rory, what does it say about our country that this is I was flicking through my German news websites as I do every Every evening last night, when I go back in the theater, and this this this this story there about this is the row the row between Sunak and Johnson about whether his dad should be called sir And Lee, I mean, we're just a joke at the moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it it's beyond imagining. It's absolutely beyond imagining. In fact, so disturbing. Unfortunately, north of the border, we now have something else going on which is really peculiar, which is Nicola Sturgeon was put in custody. I mean, the police actually took her into custody and then released her again, and That's an incredible thing.\n\nSo just to quickly remind people of this story, this relates to a police investigation into 6 160,000 pounds of donations that went to the SNP that seem, in some way, to, well, something's gone wrong with them, We have to be a bit careful here on on not getting ourselves sued or put in prison ourselves, but, anyway, that's what the police are investigating. And Amongst the people they've started investigating were Peter Marrow, who is Nicola Sturgeon's husband, who we talked about this too, in an incredible conflict of interest, he was this chief executive of the SMP at the same time as she was the 1st minister in Scotland. So he's been, interviewed by the police. She's been interviewed by the police. There's been this stuff about some kind of mobile home that was bought, which was seized from her His parents' house?\n\nSpeaker 0: Also, the the the party treasurer has also been interviewed by police. All 3 have been interviewed and released without charge. Now at the risk of my, Scottish Labour friends shouting at me as they have in the past for being far too in touch to Nicola Sturgeon, I think we should make clear she was released without charge. No charges have been have been brought forward. And Police Scotland have been very, very clear That all of us, you know, and that includes us, Rory, should be very, very careful about how we discuss what is clearly a live investigation.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: I was talking to, you get some amazing people in the in the swimming pool that I go to, but one of them was a a judge. And, I was I was sort of asking about this thing. I said, why why couldn't this have been done? Why do these things have to be done with this sort of process of arrest and taken to the station and so forth. And he was saying it's partly to do with taping.\n\nThey have the equipment there to tape everything. But it's also that they they want to give people the police in this sort of investigation want to give people a real sense of the seriousness of it. But I I think it is. It's a it's a pretty, it's a pretty astonishing, turn of events.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of the big things happening in the SMP Is there a huge cause including from one of the last leadership candidates to have her suspended? Partly because Nicola Sturgeon was actually famous for Frequently suspending or removing the whip from any other SNP politician who faced police investigations, and there's a great list of them on the BBC. So Alex Salmond quit the party in 2018. You remember he was tried and cleared at trial of sexually assaulting 9 women. Yeah.\n\nPatrick Grady was suspended from the party for making another MP for making a sexual advance to a teenage member of staff. Former might finance minister Derek Mackie was suspended for messaging a 16 year old boy on social media. Margaret Ferrier lost the S&P whip after speaking in the Westminster Parliament while awaiting the results for COVID tests in September 2020 before traveling back by train to Glasgow without, Self isolating. And another former SMP MP, Natalie McGarry, was sentenced to 2 years in jail for embezzling £25,000 from the SMP.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's It's quite a long list, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's quite a long list, and and and and I think, you know, one of the things that obviously Nicola Sturgeon was doing by suspending these things quickly was To try to say this is not a tiny, cozy set of people, but it's striking that Hamzah Yusuf hasn't done What I guess you would advise him to do, which was suspend her straight away until the results became clear. Or is that not your advice? What what do you think you should do?\n\nSpeaker 0: I was aware of some of those cases that you mentioned. I wasn't aware of them all. It does suggest that that was the approach. He is obviously Hamza Yousef is obviously taking a a very different precedent. Because he said in an interview on the back of this when he was under, as you say, under pressure from a lot of people to suspend Nicola Nicola Sturgeon.\n\nHe said, I'm not suspending Nicola's membership. I'm treating her in the same way that I've treated, for example, Colin Beatty. Now Colin Beatty is the aforementioned former S&P treasurer who was has already been, arrested and released without charge. So he's decided that is the precedent he wants. He says, those that have been released without charge, I see no reason to suspend their membership.\n\nSo that says that he's decided he will suspend them from the party if and when This escalates further. But, look, I I do I do feel a bit sorry for him, to be honest. I mean, he is what a total mess he has now inherited. And every time he tries to get onto the front foot and speak about something else, there's something else is popping up to kind of knock him down.\n\nSpeaker 1: So my friend, Angus MacNeill, who's, from the Highlands and Islands, who I used to go canoeing with on the Thames, he was, he\n\nSpeaker 0: was like, he's a Gallic speaker, isn't he?\n\nSpeaker 1: He's a Gallic speaker And he was he was a friend of mine in parliament. So he's been out saying, this soap opera has gone far enough. Nicholas Sturchin suspended others from the SMP for an awful lot less. So I guess Angus MacNeil would be appealing to you as a former expert on communications saying that he thinks the longer she remains, the more the soap opera continues, and he thinks it's necessary to move fast to cauterize this by suspending it.\n\nSpeaker 0: The only thing I'd say to that is that I think that when you're talking about a former first minister And you talk about somebody as well known as Nicola Sturgeon, I think it moves to a completely different level when it involves Police Scotland making these inquiries. So I think look. What happens now is what's important in terms of the that that police investigation rather than some sort of short term tactical thing that Jose Yousef tries to do. So, look, I I'm I'm guessing that what he what Angus is saying there about This is part of this. What I think has become clear since Nicola Sturgeon left is that the divisions within the SMP, Both personality and policy and political are much deeper than maybe you and I, looking in from the outside, were aware because the sense we got the whole time was that Nicola Sturgeon had a really tight grip of the whole party pretty much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's amazing. I I've In reading David Torrance's biography of Nicola Sturgeon, he also read a a biography of Alex Salmond, and it's it's very striking. He wrote it Just after the Brexit referendum when she was absolutely at her peak, because after the referendum, she came out very, very clearly. She was celebrated internationally for being the 1 leader with a very clear view in Britain about how to respond to the referendum And it's an extraordinary story.\n\nIt's the story of somebody who was a very, very hardworking girl from a Tough working class background in Ayrshire who got to Glasgow University was fanatically interested in politics, in SMP politics from the age 16 onwards, she'd spent her holidays at SMP youth camps, and her first, connection with Peter Morell, now her husband, former chief executive of the SMP was that he was running SMP Communications and put her on television at the age of 18. That was her first, Appearance because he already spotted the talent, and somebody who was initially far to the left of you, she was disgusted by Neil Kinnock, for example, She thought he was far too right wing. She very much on the kind of Benite side of things, and, you know, very much CND was incredibly important to her.\n\nSpeaker 0: That strand exists still in the SMP, and I think that's the the thing that she's managed to straddle pretty well. But I think there's no doubt she's been a very, very significant political figure and has been viewed widely as a very, very effective politician. But the big thing that she's fought for all her life looks to me like it's less likely to happen than it than it did. And, obviously, her statement was very, very strong. I'm confident I haven't done anything wrong, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nSo that's why I say, ultimately, Where this case now goes will decide her legacy as much as anything.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, as as we move to the break, we're about to move on to Another major political figure who had a lot to do with the police and courts, Silvio Berlusconi, who claimed to have appeared In over 30 court cases and appeared in the witness stands, he claimed 2,000 times, but his relationship with the truth was always a bit peculiar, and we'll return to that after the break.\n\nSpeaker 0: So So welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with me, Rory Stewart. And, Alastair, what one of the things that we wanted to just touch on is is we did this Interview with Kate Raworth who's an economist who, developed the cider of doughnut economics, which people can listen to on The Rest is Politics Leading. Kate Kate Ray, what's what what did you think of that interview?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it seems to have gone down very, very well. Marsalafora on Twitter. Because we said in our discussion afterwards that we both, I think, found something utterly compelling about her vision and the need for the chain the scale of change required, but But we just couldn't quite see how to make it happen politically. But I'll tell you, I don't know if you've been following this. I'm gonna just hold this so you can see it, and we'll we'll put it in the, The show notes as well.\n\nHave you seen these graphs on the temperatures of the water in the the Atlantic, which are just absolutely terrifying? So, essentially, the the the it's a graph that shows that water temperatures are rising way higher than they should be. And She was talking about, you know, the dangers of actually reaching sort of tipping point. You look at stuff like this, and it's just terrifying. And I'll tell you the other thing I think is interesting.\n\nI do think there's It's important that at some point, those people like her, who are utterly, you know, not single issue because it's everything, but, you know, Absolutely fixated, fanatical, and I use these words in a positive way, campaigning on something as important as that. But it but understanding that you have to, at some stage, engage properly with the political process, and I guess that's where you and I can maybe, I don't know. Help do more. I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: By by demonstrating the world weary cynicism of the political process.\n\nSpeaker 0: I know. And you getting on another bloody airplane today as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. That's it. That's it. Quite right. Now we are now gonna move on to the amazing Story of Silvio Budaskoni, who you met.\n\nRight?\n\nSpeaker 0: I met many times. Yeah. Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanna really hear about that, but I'm just just for the sake Of listeners, just to remind them a little bit about Berlusconi. Berlusconi, born in 1936, so he was born in Mussolini's, Italy. He Started life as a law student. He was a very, very keen singer. Famously he was a crooner on cruise ships, And he then went, firstly, into real estate development where he built these enormous sort of interconnected 19 seventies futuristic, skyscrapers for 4,000 people connected by weird bridges then set up a television company initially serving his Skyscrapers and exploited the fact that Italy was a pretty conservative lockdown place in the 19 seventies, early Tinnatees and their equivalent to the BBC was a very, very prim Catholic broadcaster and he pioneered Essentially, women, with their tops off and, entertainment shows and eventually managed to persuade an An Italian prime minister in the early 19 eighties to pass emergency legislation allowing his shows to be shown through the country and ended up controlling 90%, literally 90% of Italy's television.\n\nAnd he used this position to go Onto I bet you'll tell us a bit about this too. He he owned AC Milan.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: He he wrote the theme tune for AC Milan, thus getting into a sort of musical theme.\n\nSpeaker 0: He co he co wrote it. He co wrote it with a proper writer.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then in 1994, he decided to go into politics. And Using his incredible television platform, he got 50 of the advertising executives on his company to also stand with him, used his Coverage of 90% of Italian TV to get himself, and then eventually, his 50 advertising executives elected, became PM in 94, Served 94 to 95. Prime minister again, 2001 to 2006, which was very important because he came in behind George Bush in the Iraq war. And then again, 2008 to 2011. And the reason we're just talking about him is he's just died.\n\nBut over to you, who has some personal experience of the man?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, he he's, he is a a truly extraordinary figure of our times. And I was doing, an interview with CNN yesterday about my book As It Happened, but but because of Trump in the indictment and Johnson going through his troubles, they wanted to talk about the whole sort of populism thing. And the researcher had done his, done his work because they flashed up a quote from the book as follows. When it comes to the use of post truth strategies in Western democracies, perhaps the first big mover was the media magnate Silvio Berlusconi. I think he is in many ways a precursor of Trump and of Johnson.\n\nAnd I think what he did, which was Incredibly clever. If if his aim was always to go into politics, which I suspect it was and he once said to somebody, by the way, that the first time he went into politics, It was to avoid landing himself in a terrible court case where he thought he was gonna go to jail. So he basically understood, as many politicians have, That getting good media on your side is very, very helpful in politics, but he did it completely differently. He created this media landscape, as you say, with 90% control and then went into politics. And that 90%, you're you're talking almost kind of authoritarian levels of of media control.\n\nAnd the other thing he was, he became the showman. He was an ink, You know, he was a crooner. I actually think he's one of those guys who was much better looking before he had all the plastic surgery. I think he was actually a very good looking Young man, apparently, he was quite a good singer. I want I did hear him sing once, but only in a kind of he was messing around sort of way.\n\nBut he then became this great showman. The football was a part of that. You know, football Italy is a pretty football crazy country. AC Milan. He owned AC Milan from 1986 to 2017.\n\nThey had a lot of success during that period. So that made him popular. The TV stuff made him popular. And this kind of populist blokey, The whole banga banga party staying\n\nSpeaker 1: a little bit. Interrupt, tell people what the banga banga party is.\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought you'd be interested in banga bungas.\n\nSpeaker 1: So banga banga parties Were his names for these parties where he had an enormous number of young women gathered at a villa, and it came to public attention because one of these women was arrested by the police, And he managed to get her off by telephoning the Italian police and telling them that she was the niece of, I think, the president of Morocco or something, And that it was incredibly embarrassing to create a diplomatic incident, and she was then released. She subsequently, claimed that he never slept with her and that it was all very innocent, And, he was just a lonely old man who likes having 17 year old girls performing in parties\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, one of one of his wives did make a very Volley will complain about his seeming predilection for very young women, which seems to have lasted his entire life.\n\nSpeaker 1: Part of his whole identity, wasn't it? I mean, he was,\n\nSpeaker 0: Totally.\n\nSpeaker 1: I suppose a bit like a lot of populous leaders. I mean, it's part of, I guess, what initially appealed to people about Boris Johnson, which is His kind of off color humor that he would make these kind of bar jokes all the time. I mean, some of them were completely Extraordinary. Someone, you know, more straightforward, he would say, come and invest in Italy because we have the most beautiful secretaries in the world. But then he would compare, you know, a German member of the European Parliament.\n\nHe he would say, she looks like the kind of person who'd work in a Nazi concentration camp.\n\nSpeaker 0: Have I said alright. I I I'll I'll tell you my my favorite Berlusconi story. So NATO summit, Berlusconi has he because remember, he was prime minister, I think, in total for 9 years. He was prime minister through 4 different governments of varying length. But at one point, he became Italy took on the rotating presidency of NATO.\n\nHe hadn't been prime minister that long, and he made this sort of amazing speech about NATO and the power of NATO or the transatlantic alliance and the relationship with America. And it was very, very, very pro American, very pro NATO. And as you said earlier, he was, you know, he supported George Bush on the the Iraq war, and he and he was very Atlanticist when it came to security. Jack Chirac was sitting there getting grumpier and grumpier and grumpier as Berlusconi became more and more sort of florid in his pro NATO statements. And so Chirac very loudly demanded to be the next speaker.\n\nAnd, of course, he was quite a senior dude, so Presses his his, microphone and the lights on and there's Chirac speaking. Chirac then starts to give Berlusconi A rather gentle at first, but then getting less gentle taste of his opinion as to why, you know, Europe is where his heart should be and All this stuff about, you know, NATO, let's not lose sight of Europe, and da da da da da da da da. At which point, Silvio Berdisconi sort of clicks his fingers. And this is the bit I'm not sure. I think I have to describe it in this way because it is relevant to the story.\n\nA truly stunning Young woman, who was clearly one of Italy's most renowned models, suddenly walked into the room, Walked around the room, and I have to say, I think virtually every single person in that room, male or female, was looking at this incredibly beautiful woman walking into the room. And she went over to Berlusconi, And she whispered into his ear, and he turned to her and whispered into his ear. And then she went out of the room, and she came back while Churak was still speaking away With fewer and fewer people listening, she came back with a tray of watches. These watches which were then sort of being offered to the various leaders around the table. So all all guaranteed\n\nSpeaker 1: to make sure that as Chirac because making his serious speech, nobody was paying any attention at all because they were all looking at the woman or the watch.\n\nSpeaker 0: They were looking they were looking, first of all, at the woman, but, allegedly, they were looking at the watch, and then they were trying on the watches. So, yeah, he was but I'll tell you what. The the one thing I would say where I think, you know, we can maybe laugh about that kind of thing, But he was also a precursor to Trump and Johnson and Putin, if you like, in the constant undermining of the rule of law. I mean, the whole thing about he used politics to change laws to help him get out of legal situations that he was in. And and\n\nSpeaker 1: he totally and and and, of course, Used politics completely to, for conflict of interest reasons for his own media and political empires.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. I\n\nSpeaker 1: mean, he he was a very, very Strange, disturbing figure, and I think he he, you know, at some points, he'd pay tribute to Mussolini. He clearly had, like Trump, an incredible chip on his shoulder about what he perceived as the establishment. So even though, like Trump, he's a billionaire, both of them are property billionaires, But both of them felt the establishment never took them seriously. He he was always known as Cavalieri. He he had he had got this sort of Dodgy knighthood, which he'd eventually given up.\n\nBut I think a lot of his life was about feeling weirdly that he was the kind of underdog Fighting against, the kind of sneering. And someone like Chirac would have really, I guess, wound him up because he would have represented the kind of great The sort of French intellectual talking down at him.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. He he's, I hadn't really thought of him that respect because he always emanated A sense of incredible self confidence, and and he had a real kind of look at me feel to him. But you could be right. Maybe because his his background, I think, was Quite. His dad was a fairly lowly bank official.\n\nHis his his mom, I I think, was was a housewife who just looked after him and the family. If you sort of look up Berlusconi, I guess this is inevitable given the the role of organized crime in its Italian history. But, you know, the links with the mafia, there there's always that sense of, You know, how close he was or wasn't to to organized crime.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, because del Lutri, who was the cofounder of Forza Italia, with him was eventually sent to jail for 9 years for his mafia links. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of questions about where I mean, it it's the same, With that horrifying figure in the United States, Jeffrey Epstein, with both of them, there are huge questions about where they got their first money from. People can sort of understand the logic of how he managed to use the money he made from his 4,000 apartment blocks into building media empire.\n\nWhat's much less, Kier, is where on earth he got the money from to start?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, apparently, it's it's reckoned that I mean, the the various Assessments you see is that he's worth somewhere between $6,000,000,000. So he's got I think he's got 5 children between 2 different women. So they all stand to gain a a fair few, Bob. The favorite little fact that I didn't know until I saw the some of the obituaries is that he was a freemason, and his lodge was called if I think if I was a freemason, this is the the lodge that I would join. It was called Propaganda Due.\n\nSpeaker 1: Propaganda Due.\n\nSpeaker 0: Propaganda Due Lodge is was was per S. Cody's Lodge.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very it's a very it's a good fact. Okay. Now we we don't have much time left, Pankaj, so we wanted to touch briefly on Latin America. And You've been looking at something called the lithium triangle and relationships with China. And obviously we'll have chances to come back to Latin America in more depth on other Pods because we don't do enough on Latin America, but I'd love to hear from you a bit on what you've been finding out.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, this was your idea, really, to to say, you know, we didn't really talk about Latin America much. But Think that, you know, we've talked about Africa, and you've got a lot of experience of Africa. And it seems to me that during the Cold War, There wasn't that much interest being paid to Latin America, particularly by by China. And I can't remember who it was, but somebody came up with the the the idea that we've gone from the cold war to a cold piece. And that the and that China has actually been very, very, very systematic about developing relations in in Latin America.\n\nIt was Richard Richard Haas, who's the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. He says he's he's got this view that power is now spreading to a greater number of actors in the geopolitical space and that Latin America is a a target for that. And you probably heard this phrase about geopolitical swing states. You know, we all know what a swing state is in the the American electoral context, But there are now geopolitical swing states who basically, they're not necessarily pro this side or pro that side. They're making calculations according to their own, sometimes commercial, sometimes strategic interests.\n\nAnd, you know, the lithium triangle is essentially lithium is such an important commodity for batteries, for cars, for transferring to renewables, and so forth. And Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia right up there in terms of possessing the lithium that other nations, in particular, the Chinese want, because the Chinese then have the capacity to to take it and do with it what they will. So I just think that you're seeing far more attention from China from America, interestingly, how, you know, America is starting to look slightly different than Venezuela in recent months. And so So I think there's a lot going on there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, one of the things that we've we've talked about in the podcast, and I was I mean, looking at the kind of big six, so, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia. You can see that there's a kind of, obviously there's a there's a pattern that many, many countries around the world have followed, but it's maybe more dramatic in Latin America than elsewhere, which broadly speaking feels like A cold war history, often military governments, and then as they moved from the late eighties into the early nineties, the emergence of these kinds of Technocratic Washington consensus new president. So in Brazil, Cardoso, who's an intellectual, In Argentina, MENEM, in Chile, Largo, in Peru, Fujimori, in Colombia, maybe Uribe, in Mexico, Zedillo. And there's this credible boom largely driven by commodities, which means that they're not hit as hard by the 2008 financial crisis As Europe or the United States are.\n\nBut what hits them is the commodity crash in about 2014, and it's from then onwards That you see these populous governments emerging. I mean, dramatically, as we've talked about, on the right, Bolsonaro in Brazil, But we've also talked about the left wing populists Absolutely. Emerged. So Borics, for example, Gustavo Petro, Obrador, Pedro Castillo. And I I think it I mean, maybe this is where your friend who brought us the three p's\n\nSpeaker 0: of What is his name?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Populism post truth polarization. His book really begins in Latin America, doesn't it? And sees that this phenomenon is being something that Latin America explores first.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. There's there's there's another book, I'd mentioned in which he actually he does feature. And it's a very staged title, but it's it's worth looking at. It's It's called China and Latin America Development Agency in Geopolitics, and it's written by Christopher Alden and a guy called Alvaro Mendez. And it's literally it is literally that, a history of relations between China and Latin America.\n\nAnd the turning point seems to have been Deng Xiaoping in the late seventies and the whole sort of reform reform program. And the restoration of diplomatic links that, frankly, during the previous era, had just been sort of virtually untouched. And and the the in interestingly, the the country that really seems to have sort of Led this in a way was Peru. And, there was a new Peru China trade agreement in 2009, and that led to sort of, you know, massive new foreign direct investment. Argentina, obviously hugely important.\n\nThey've got an election coming up this year, but but part of the debate in that has been, Are we America? Are we China? And, obviously, Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, biggest population, lots of, natural resources and so forth. And Lula, interestingly, has been out to China quite recently, and they're talking about this big big partnership on a satellite.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So this is related to the Belt and Road Initiative, which is this amazing Chinese infrastructure investment, $4,000,000,000,000 worth, Which you see a lot of in Africa, you've seen in Pakistan and in Latin America, which is about building an incredible network of Infrastructure from dams, ports, roads, bridges and actually has even had European and East European out sheets as people have signed up to the Belt and Road Initiative. It's a sort of Chinese massive soft power play with an enormous amount of development finance behind it.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. And that's exactly what it is. And and the point is that in the past, a lot of Chinese diplomacy is being conducted through stealth, And they're now out there very, very open, openly inviting partners in Central and South America in the in the in the Belt and Road Initiative. They've got this new partnership with the community of Latin American and Caribbean states. And China's now become South America's 1st trading partner, Largest source of financing in space, infrastructure, energy, 2,700 major China funded companies operating around the place.\n\nAnd the other thing that's interesting that comes out in this in the in the book that I mentioned, China and Latin America, is that the that experience of African countries of, in a sense, being drawn into development traps linked to growing external debt. There is obviously the worry that that is gonna be replicated across Latin America.\n\nSpeaker 1: Listen. Just as we come to, and I'd like to plug A guy called Michael Reed who's written a very good book called forgotten continent, who I think was at The Economist, but, anyway, a a British journalist who's who's done some brilliant work on Latin America.\n\nSpeaker 0: Good. Well, okay. We should call it a day then.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, thank you all very, very much. Well, thank you in particular, not all of you. Well, I also the team. But, Yeah. Thank you to the team.\n\nThank you to our producers. We don't thank enough. And also, thank you to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright, Roy. Speak to you soon.",
