Welcome to another episode of The Restless Politics Question Time with me, Alastair Campbell. Me, Rory Stewart. And, Rory, I think the single biggest issue that was raised this week was the b word, Brexit, In 2 parts, 1, the effects of Brexit, but also a lot of questions about Labour's position. Nick Simpson, starmer seems to be really doubling down on being against Free movement, single market. Does he really believe this? Why is his position hardened? Is this good politics, or is he going too far? Richie g, given the raft of evidence emerging about the negative effects of Brexit, when do you think public discourse may move on to the potential for another referendum? Honestly, we had loads of these. Then Adol, first Australia, now Japan, both mirages of trade deals. It just goes on and on and on. And it's all You know, I do really think, Roy, that the public are ahead of the politicians on this. I really do. Well, there's definitely definitely a big shift going on, isn't it? I mean, we we can now see a more Consistent picture on the opinion polls of people beginning to say that Brexit is a mistake, which wasn't true in the early days. I mean, I I think the Remain campaigners kept hoping in the early days that they could show dramatic examples of people who voted Brexit who changed their mind, but more and more of those examples now emerging. And, of course, as we face 2 types of crisis, one of them an economic crisis and the other the security crisis from Russia, Ukraine, There will be more and more pressure to say that Europe represents the the region we have most in common with, economically, terms of our values, in terms of our security interests, and when you're trying to solve for the 2 big things, the breakdown of the global order and the collapse of the British economy, The European Union seems like a a much stronger answer than it might have seemed for voters in 2016 who lived in a much more complacent era where they thought that trade with China was a pretty uncomplicated growth story and where they didn't have to worry about internal security in Europe. Yeah. I mean, I look. The I'm hoping that what Labour are doing, as I said on the main podcast, is just sort of avoiding big traps. But I almost got the feeling over the weekend that you had a sense that the government is beginning to understand that they're going to have to revisit Some of this stuff, they still haven't fixed the Northern Ireland protocol. There are still sort of massive barriers to trade that, they appear to be doing nothing to try to bring down, Whereas Keir's line is very, very hard line. And I think there does come a point where there are some I know that he's you know, this is very much focused on on people who maybe are fed up with the government, but also would be very, very upset if if Labour tried to kind of undo the Brexit situation. But, you know, ultimately, when we're talking about an economy that's getting hit by 4% year on year and I don't know if you saw Jeremy Hunt being interviewed by Beth Quigby on Sky News. And, you know, so I'm often critical of our interviewers because they let the politicians away with murder. She did not let him go. She just pinned him. And eventually, you got very, very, very stroppy about being asked the same question. Beth is a ferocious interviewer. I mean, she was incredibly tough with Boris Johnson. I mean, she was one of the Effective interviews with him. And Cindy, I'm not certain it's 4% year on year. Normally, the calculations are are 4% over an extended time period. But Just on on Keir Starmer, one of the things that we did pick up in some of the Twitter questions is the question around his values. Remember, he was Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Brexit spokesman. And he very much presented himself in the House of Commons at that period as somebody who wouldn't compromise with a soft Theresa May deal because he was pushing, Essentially seen for a kind of single market customs union solution and at the same time probably flirting with people like you by suggesting he was in favour of a 2nd referendum, and that maybe if he could kill Theresa May's deal, he could get a 2nd referendum. And he seems to have abandoned that entirely instead of what I would have thought would be consistent, which is saying I was a passionate remainer. I remain very firmly of the view that Britain's interests lie in being closer to Europe. I may think we shouldn't have a referendum again, but I definitely will be pushing for a closer diplomatic, economic, political relations with Europe. He's going the other way, and and that is a bit odd, isn't it, given that it was so central to his brand? Well, I think it's but I think it's because he's He's concerned that the conservatives are going to portray him as being determined to take us back into the European Union, come what may. But I I just don't think that flies with the public because I don't think they I think it's such a sort of inside the Westminster bubble point. I mean, how many people really remember what Keir Starmer's Position was on Brexit, not that many outside Westminster. And so I think he's far better to say, look. We are in a complete mess. Our economy is tanking. The country is going in the wrong direction. I agree with you. He he could say, we are not revisiting the basic question about membership of the European Union, but we have to fix this deal, and we have to get better trading relations with the European Union. He could definitely say that. Instead of which, it goes back to the point I made in the main podcast about Labour saying what they're not for rather than what they are, Instead of which we're getting, you know, we're not doing the single market. We're not doing customs union. Freedom of movement is a red line. We need more British workers for British jobs, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The public is way ahead of them on this. In 2018, when people like me were getting very frustrated with Kit Starmer because, you Remember, there was a moment when Theresa May had essentially lost most of the Tory party and, in desperation, reached out to Jeremy Corbyn and Kezsana, Try to get a deal across the line. He set these 6 tests on Brexit. And maybe it's a good way of thinking about Brexit. I mean, these were quite thoughtful ways of thinking about the issue, so he asked, does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with EU? Does it deliver exactly the same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union? Does it ensure the fair management of migration? Does it defend rights and protections, prevent prevent a race at the bottom, does it protect national security, does it deliver for all regions and nations in the UK? And you would have thought he could return to those At the very least, there's a way of making argument for a much closer relationship with Europe without necessarily reopening the referendum. I find increasingly few people who are willing to tell me that there's any benefit to what we've done. And yet you've got both main parties essentially saying it can't be revisited. It's it's it's fantasy land, it really is. Now quest question for you. I'm conscious you ask a lot of questions, and And as you say, I give 2 long answers. So, Angela Neuburger, I'd assume that it'd be very tough for Labour to win a general election without getting more seats back in Scotland. What's the electoral mess on this? Will Nicholas surgeons threat to turn the next election to vote on independence help Labour or Tories or both? So Labour in Scotland, run by Anna Sawa, where do you see their future and their importance for the Labour Party in the next election? Well, there are 2 things, I think, to to say about this. The first is that The SMP are still very, very dominant in Scotland. No doubt about that. I think the thing that has stopped a lot of people who might be minded to vote Labour from doing so is because in recent years, they haven't thought there's a hope in hell's chance of Labour actually winning a majority. And therefore, they've been The SMP have been able to corral people essentially to be saying, look, vote for the SMP because that's the way you're gonna get Scotland's voice heard more strongly in Scotland. I think the more that it seems like Labour might win the majority, then I think you will get moderate SMP supporters. In other words, people who whose defining issue is not necessarily independence, but just the fact that they prefer the SMP to the other parties. I think there's a chance for Labour to bring those over. I do think she's taking a risk in in saying that the next general election is is a referendum on independence because, you know, the fact is that there's a lot, Just there's a lot going wrong in our economy. There's a lot going wrong in in when I say our economy, I mean, the national economy, UK. There's a there's a lot going wrong in Scotland in terms of public services and so forth. And, you know, if it looks like she's doing this as a way of avoiding the things that people actually tend to want to to debate and see debated at general election. I can see that playing against her and for Labour. And for for listeners, just to remind people how odd what happened to Labour in Scotland was. So Labour was the 1st party in Scotland almost continuously from the 19 twenties and certainly from the certainly from the late fifties. And it didn't really, from the early sixties, drop below 40 seats out of 71. The the number of seats were reduced later, but Still kept 40 seats out of 59 as late as 2010. So almost every year, every election, 41, 50, 49, even 56 Seats in in the early Tony Blair days. And then suddenly in 2015, in 5 years, went from 41 seats in Scotland to 1 seat. Lost I mean, I I don't know what that is. Lost 90% of their seats. Crept up in 2017 to 7 seats and then collapsed. Why are you reminding me of this? I I I know all this. It's amazing. It's just the most astonishing thing, isn't it? And then collapses again in 2019 to one's one seat. Yeah. But listen, how many how many here's one for you. You you sent a very interesting article that'd been written by Sam Friedman about this thing of nimby's and yimby's, not in my backyard, and young people who want things in their backyard, like, you know, houses to live in. When you look at how few seats the conservatives now have in big cities. I mean, is it is isn't it possible that the conservatives, particularly if they carry on with this kind of, you know, nimbyism at the heart of their planning, approach to planning and housing and so forth. And onshore wind farms is the other one that's becoming in now as a great sort of, you know, nimby's v yimbys. I like that one, n b v y n b. Thank you for sending that. But isn't isn't it possible that the conservatives could see something similar happening to them in places where they used to be strong? Well, the this this is, of course, what what the Conservative Party has been terrified of now for for 10, 15 years. So Margaret Thatcher rebuilt the Conservative Party brand partly by getting people on the housing ladder, partly through this policy of Allowing people to buy their council houses, which turned millions of people into owners and gave them a capital asset, which became very important. Big part of the housing problem we've got now, Rory. Big part of the housing problem we've got now, but incredibly successful politics and and actually incredibly beneficial for many of the families that able to buy their houses. It totally transformed their assets, totally transformed their financial futures, which is why she picks up an enormous number of voters by doing it. And since that time, housing prices have rocketed, more and more people have begun treating their house as an asset, And we're now in a situation in which it is almost impossible and has been for 15, 20 years for a young person to get, as it were, on the housing ladder. And most of the policies that the conservative Governments have pursued since 2010, haven't fixed this. They've done things such as to try to subsidize mortgages, which seem, in many cases, just In normal economic terms, just have driven the prices up further. They tried to address it By building programs that didn't work, they never met their housing targets. There's a lot of nostalgia for Harold Macmillan who built, you know, millions of those, houses back in the fifties. And at the heart of the problem seems to be our planning system. It's very difficult to get planning permission. Development land is very expensive. There's a lot of cases, although the the property development companies deny it, of land banking, in other words, holding back land that they could develop and aren't developing. And this means that particularly young people and people in cities feel that they're never gonna be able to own a house. And The conservative party's been trying since 2010, or factions within it, Gavin Barwell, for example, who was Theresa May chief of staff, was a influential housing minister, Trying to argue that the only way that conservatives will manage to win back younger voters and working class voters is if They start allowing houses to be built, and, certainly, the snibbyism is blocking that. And I I see it's given rise to yet another of these Marvelous names that they give themselves. We've had the European Research Group, which has done so much damage to the to the country and its economy and its standing in the world. And these guys call themselves the, Is it the planning concern group or the housing concern group? Most of these story groups, it seems to me that you have to think of the opposite of what they're saying in that Well, in in that in that case, In in that case, that's Theresa Villiers who, played a very big part in wrecking over Brexit, who's actually essentially Driven a rebellion against the government's attempt to try to bring a bill in that would have made housing easier has led a sort of NIMBY rebellion, and It shows a big fracture again in the conservative party and a big problem for Rishi Sunak's leadership that somebody like Theresa Villiers can do that. And we've also had, both Boris Johnson analyst trusts supporting amendment to try to force a change on the opposition to onshore wind farms as well. Extraordinary. Now here's a question for you. How does a normal person become an MP? Question around normal person is very interesting. So there've been some comments about the fact that there are many more university graduates in that House of Commons And there are in the population as a whole. I think it's sort of nearly 80% of MPC university graduates with less than 50% of the population. But Jessica Coates is coming from a different direction. She says, I've been reflecting on Francois Hollande's observation that increasingly few educated people are choosing political careers. My Cambridge educated friends and I all went straight into private sector careers without much thought. Now having achieved financial security, many of us are considering a career in politics. But without parents involved in the political circuit, it seems difficult. So how does a, inverted commas, normal person, which in her case seems to be, actually, You could call a wealthy educated person, go about becoming an MP. What do you make for that? Well, obviously, when it comes out next year, she'll have to get my book, but what do I do? How to fix politics. You know, we were talking about Johnny Mercer. When he decided to become an MP, he just went and found a seat, and he just sort of went round knocking on doors, and he got He sort of barged his way in. I think Not not well, let let me let me come in on this because he still needed to be approved by his local party. I mean, that's the big choke point. Correct. Yeah. But he sort of he but he didn't find it that difficult. Now listen. I know for most people, it's incredibly difficult. More far more people I know lots of people at the moment who are trying to go for Selection as Labour candidates that are way more want to do it than there are places. It's about who you know. It's about how you get on with them. But I think the other thing you have to do, Jessica, if if you if you want to do this, I'm afraid you do have to kind of you you have to work out the power structures. You have to go and find the people that and then you have to make an impression on them. And even then, you might not win. That's the only thing you have to accept, because a lot of people do want to be MPs. It's just that a lot of them Really, you know, I don't think we're getting the brightest and the best necessarily who want to do it. Although I have been impressed by some of the the new candidates that I've seen and by some of the people. I met a guy last week He's 27, trying to get a seat. And, honestly, if I were the Labour Party, I'd just I'd just move heaven and earth to get him. He's really smart, really bright. I think we need a lot of younger people in there. How do you weigh up this question of, on the one hand, people saying MPs need more qualifications, more Experience the outside world. And how do you balance that against another argument which says that the House of Commons should fully reflect the diversity of the country? In other words, if Less than half the people in the country have a university degree. Less than half MPs should have a university degree. No. I don't I don't buy the idea. I don't I don't worry about whether it sort of Accurately reflects the whole of the country. I think it'd be great if it looked a little bit more like the country than the House of Commons does now. You know, sometimes you look at prime minister's questions and you look at the Tory benches in Ticketing to see these sort of white men in suits, and you see Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Sorry. Let me push back hard on that. Right. The conservatives have had Far more minority ethnic sectaries say. You didn't have a single one when Labour was in, not a single No. We've talked about the cabinet. No. I'm See, I'm saying sometimes that this this may be just the sort of the way that the see the ones who get in to get the seats. Sometimes you look at the Tory benches, and you really struggle to see anything other than why not. Tory front bench, you see it's something that's actually more aggressive. Look. Rory. Rory, I've I have noticed, Rory. Since Boris Johnson departed, You become much more defensive about the conservative party. That's fine. Only only when you say things which are not fully nuanced and reflecting on labor's The flaws in this. Why has Labour so catastrophically failed to get more diversity into its front benches? We can name names. I can point to that wonderful chap from Slough, who's brilliant every time I see him on social media. We can point to David Lammy. We can point to all sorts of people. But the point, Mike, the point we're making on what point was I making, Maria? I forgot. I think you were trying to talk about whether the House The comments was representative. And then for some reason, you decided to choose the conservative party. Yeah. No. I'll tell you what. The the other thing I think we've gotta understand is that so for example, I I got into a ferocious rally the other a day with somebody at a a dinner I was speaking at. Because he was going on about, you know, Trouble is these politicians, they're all the same and the usual stuff that you get fed up of hearing. And I was sort of pushing back on that. He he actually said this, I don't want people like Angela Rayner in in a government. I said, what do you mean people like Angela Rayner? He said, well, you know, the way she speaks. I said, what do you mean what do you mean the way she speaks? And it was like what it was was a sort of, on the one hand, I want politicians to be more normal and more like us. On the other hand, the minute they are, I want to say that they're not fit for the job. And I got really because I thought that was just a sort of basic kind of snobbery. I think there is still snobbery about it. Coming out of my defensive crouch for a moment, the this question of qualifications, experience, diversity is very personal to me. I mean, obviously, I'm the epitome of somebody who's not representative. I'm a old Etonian, middle aged white guy. But I found with constituents that There's a difficult thing to resolve. On the one hand, people felt in Cumbria, what on earth are we doing with this person as RMP because he's not like us? On the other hand, other people thought, well, you know, he's written books, he's worked abroad, he's had some quite interesting experiences, we think he might be quite good at being a minister. Maybe he'd be quite suited to be a foreign minister or a different minister. Maybe he'd manage things. He's run NGOs in difficult places. Maybe he'd be okay running the prison system. So it's a very odd kind of job interview because it it it's not as simple as it would be in another job as saying you're just looking at somebody's qualifications and how good they are at running a department. You're also No. No. Listen. The thing I lament about the state of our we, you know, we talked about on the main podcast about how few politicians now make sort of really big serious speeches. I want at least a good 20% of our MPs to be really smart, really special. People, whether they're Labour or Tory or SMP or Lib Dem green or applied. I don't care. I just want people who I think I really wanna hear what they think. I've got to be honest, Rory. When most of the cabinet Quite a few of the shadow cabinet come on to the television and the radio. I kinda know what they're gonna say before they said it because I've worked out what the government and the opposition lines on something I want people are gonna say interesting things and give me interesting analysis of the world. And what's what what about the other 80%? I'd like them to be competent. I'd like them to have good values. I'd like them to be good local MPs, and and and some of them to develop into to something better. But I just feel I feel we're probably going in the wrong direction. Has to be another question, Rory. The answers are getting too long ago. Okay. Well, we we go well, let's go into the break, and I'll ask you a question straight after The rest is politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And, Rory, we've got you know, one of the one of the benefits, I guess, of being a Popular chart topping podcast is that we get lots of people want to advertise and sponsor and so forth, and We've enjoyed the the benefits of the sponsorship of Airbnb. And quite a few of our listeners have suggested that, actually, they don't see Airbnb He is the force for good that you do. So I'm now going to put you on the spot and say to you, defend them. Well, firstly, what what what is it that's troubling people? I mean, I don't really Tell me firstly what, because I I see Airbnb as a very positive force. I mean, I think it's fantastic way of bringing extra incomes, and remember, we're talking about a housing crisis and difficult for people to Find accommodation. And I think anything that makes it easier for people to use unused rooms or unused property to let other people use them is a good thing. Otherwise, it just Sits empty and unused. I get the the the criticisms that we we seem to be getting is that they're actually having the opposite effect, that they're they're adding to a housing problem. They're adding to difficulties with tourism that are facing some of our coastal and rural Well, so I guess I guess one of the I I mean, obviously, this is relevant to Cumbria where there was a loss of anxiety around 2nd homeowners and holiday homes and holiday cottages. And it's definitely true that 2nd homes, which are empty, unused, are not a contribution to the community and can lead to hollowed out communities. But by definition, Airbnb is putting things to use. There are people in the building, so it's not a question of empty second homes. It's a very good source of secondary income, for example, for farming families. And, in fact, the Labour government had a very good scheme, which I supported, of Giving grants to farming families to set up little accommodation units for holiday lets. And, you know, most Airbnb, it's not true of everyone, but I think Four fifths of them are people renting out properties for something like a couple of days a month. I stayed in one in London recently where the lady Has her family and her children staying in her basement most of the time, but just occasionally will rent it out, which takes pressure off other people. So I I think, Look. A lot of these things, Airbnb, Uber, etcetera, have problems of credit controversy, but the basic idea that technology is being used to open up opportunities Makes sense. And it's it's simply doing more efficiently what's always existed, which is giving people the capacity to rent out their their rooms. Okay. Now we've got quite a lot of questions on partisan policies. Colin Sinfield, as you 2 can hold a civil argument Beg to differ on the details. Why could running the country not be structured like this? That is government in opposition agreeing basic provision for things like health, education, housing, and then establishing the difference in election. At least I got this at the dinner that I was talking about where somebody was rude about Angela Rayner. Somebody saying, you know, why can't we take the politics out of schools and hospitals? And the answer is because they are amongst the most passionate issues that you're going to get in politics. Now I think it's Easy to say, let's be more civil with each other. That shouldn't be too difficult. But what do you think of that? Did you ever think in the house of commons that there there was a less Political way of doing politics. When I felt that. I mean, I did feel during Brexit that we should have locked the MPs in the House of Commons. You know, more than 400 of them claimed that they were in favor of a Soft compromise on Brexit. I would have liked to lock the doors and make them come to a compromise, not let them out again, like cardinals electing a pope Mhmm. Till they'd come up with a solution. I definitely feel on adult social care, which is the big remains the big central shame of British politics tickets. That hasn't been fixed since the 2nd World War, that you should get a cross party coalition. And it's horrible the way that the conservatives, every time that Labour brought a proposal together on trying to fund it would go into death tax attacks, and then labeled in the same to Theresa May when she came up with a good could have been a good cross party proposal on Adult Sushkesh, they did a dementia attack. We're gonna get the same in the next election. I mean, things haven't changed on that, have they? No. And and and it's I mean, the issues have changed, but we're we're gonna get the same. So your bigger question though, I mean, other things are genuinely political. You can't take politics out of things because many issues in British Public life are not simply technocratic. There's not an obvious objective answer. It's about choices and trade offs and lesser evils. You're always sacrificing something. You have always deciding what you want to prioritize. You know, I feel this in a very granular way when I was the flooding minister where there was no Simple engineering solution. You were weighing up the interests of a downstream community against an upstream community of gains. The company that's trying to prevent droughts against the company that's trying to prevent flooding. You're trying to deal with rewilding moves. You're trying to deal with farmers growing crops, and this stuff needs politicians. Here's a here's a question from Clement or Clement. I often hear about whips. What do they do exactly? How does the whip whip? Do Tory whips and labor whips behave in the same way? What does this three line whip mean? The whips love to think they they like people to think that you're not allowed to know how they work, but, actually, it's not that complicated. They're there to instill discipline. They're there to make sure that their parties support their party's positions. And, obviously, that's most important for the government because the government is trying to get legislation through. Yeah. So just just to give people a a a glimpse of who these people are, they are elected MPs, but they choose to enter a very strange unit In the House of Commons. They don't choose royalty. They get a point Oh, they get a point at the end. They they would choose to be in the cabinet, but they're not deemed good enough. For some of them, it's It's a route to promotion. But, anyway, once you've agreed to become a whip, you basically have taken off in a vow of silence. You're not really allowed to speak much in the House of Commons, and Your attention is focused very much on trying to make your own party vote the way that the leader wants. They're the kind of loyal, As it were, dogs of god of the leader who are there to deliver those votes, and they do it in many different ways. You get kind of, But you get sort of smooth ones who try to charm you. You get kind of rough and tough ones who try to physically manhandle you into the lobbies. You get very straightforward people who take you out for on the smoking terrace and have a cigarette and say, I just wish people would be sensible. There are many different TONES, and they actually have resources. I mean, they can also act sometimes as an HR or personnel department. They can Theoretically help MPs who have mental health issues. They, in the past, have helped MPs even with financial issues, which gives them an enormous amount of of leverage and power, But they are central to the basic idea, which is that you vote for a government, and you want that government to deliver its legislation. You don't want too many independent MPs around. I think they're also part of a two way process. They are genuinely there in part to feedback to It's often the chief whip that will give a minister or a prime minister very bad news about the way something is going down, you know, particularly in circumstances where there's a a small majority. But I I I you know? And the the other thing I think people maybe underestimate in In British politics, this may have changed because I I think things have become more polarized. But I think, certainly, when I was both when I was a journalist and when I was Working in for the Labour Party and the Labour government, you tended to have pretty good relations between, certainly, between the chief whips and other op other parts of the whip's operations because a lot of it is about doing deals to get the business of the commons through without us with minimum fuss, and that's what Sometimes, there's a there's a shared interest in doing that. Last question, so we wrap up. What would you like to see your last question? Shola Amaibi, Could we ask Rory why he thinks Southgate can't find a way to utilize Phil Foden? That's a really, really good question. I I've got a lot of questions a few like that, and a Grealish question too. I must say, I'm encouraged by you and by you sending me an amazing piece of Welsh nationalist propaganda around the Welsh team. I did watch Oh, fantastic. Was it the US match. And I must say it was pretty dismal. I mean, I thought America should was awful. But, Rory, I could've told you not to watch that. I should I Could have told you that you should have watched Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia. No. Yeah. That was possibly the worst game in the tournament so far. I strongly recommend that you that you stick with it. And, you know, top tip from you, Gunnar, who we who we supposed to be betting on? I I I think it's between Brazil and France. Very good. Okay. I'm going Brazil. Probably from probably France. I'm going Brazil. You're going France. Let's see, listeners, which one of us is right. Thank you all very much, and see you all next week. All the best.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nWelcome to another episode of The Restless Politics Question Time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And, Rory, I think the single biggest issue that was raised this week was the b word, Brexit, In 2 parts, 1, the effects of Brexit, but also a lot of questions about Labour's position. Nick Simpson, starmer seems to be really doubling down on being against Free movement, single market. Does he really believe this? Why is his position hardened? Is this good politics, or is he going too far?\n\nRichie g, given the raft of evidence emerging about the negative effects of Brexit, when do you think public discourse may move on to the potential for another referendum? Honestly, we had loads of these. Then Adol, first Australia, now Japan, both mirages of trade deals. It just goes on and on and on. And it's all You know, I do really think, Roy, that the public are ahead of the politicians on this.\n\nI really do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there's definitely definitely a big shift going on, isn't it? I mean, we we can now see a more Consistent picture on the opinion polls of people beginning to say that Brexit is a mistake, which wasn't true in the early days. I mean, I I think the Remain campaigners kept hoping in the early days that they could show dramatic examples of people who voted Brexit who changed their mind, but more and more of those examples now emerging. And, of course, as we face 2 types of crisis, one of them an economic crisis and the other the security crisis from Russia, Ukraine, There will be more and more pressure to say that Europe represents the the region we have most in common with, economically, terms of our values, in terms of our security interests, and when you're trying to solve for the 2 big things, the breakdown of the global order and the collapse of the British economy, The European Union seems like a a much stronger answer than it might have seemed for voters in 2016 who lived in a much more complacent era where they thought that trade with China was a pretty uncomplicated growth story and where they didn't have to worry about internal security in Europe.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I mean, I look. The I'm hoping that what Labour are doing, as I said on the main podcast, is just sort of avoiding big traps. But I almost got the feeling over the weekend that you had a sense that the government is beginning to understand that they're going to have to revisit Some of this stuff, they still haven't fixed the Northern Ireland protocol. There are still sort of massive barriers to trade that, they appear to be doing nothing to try to bring down, Whereas Keir's line is very, very hard line.\n\nAnd I think there does come a point where there are some I know that he's you know, this is very much focused on on people who maybe are fed up with the government, but also would be very, very upset if if Labour tried to kind of undo the Brexit situation. But, you know, ultimately, when we're talking about an economy that's getting hit by 4% year on year and I don't know if you saw Jeremy Hunt being interviewed by Beth Quigby on Sky News. And, you know, so I'm often critical of our interviewers because they let the politicians away with murder. She did not let him go. She just pinned him.\n\nAnd eventually, you got very, very, very stroppy about being asked the same question.\n\nSpeaker 1: Beth is a ferocious interviewer. I mean, she was incredibly tough with Boris Johnson. I mean, she was one of the Effective interviews with him. And Cindy, I'm not certain it's 4% year on year. Normally, the calculations are are 4% over an extended time period.\n\nBut Just on on Keir Starmer, one of the things that we did pick up in some of the Twitter questions is the question around his values. Remember, he was Jeremy Corbyn's Shadow Brexit spokesman. And he very much presented himself in the House of Commons at that period as somebody who wouldn't compromise with a soft Theresa May deal because he was pushing, Essentially seen for a kind of single market customs union solution and at the same time probably flirting with people like you by suggesting he was in favour of a 2nd referendum, and that maybe if he could kill Theresa May's deal, he could get a 2nd referendum. And he seems to have abandoned that entirely instead of what I would have thought would be consistent, which is saying I was a passionate remainer. I remain very firmly of the view that Britain's interests lie in being closer to Europe.\n\nI may think we shouldn't have a referendum again, but I definitely will be pushing for a closer diplomatic, economic, political relations with Europe. He's going the other way, and and that is a bit odd, isn't it, given that it was so central to his brand?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think it's but I think it's because he's He's concerned that the conservatives are going to portray him as being determined to take us back into the European Union, come what may. But I I just don't think that flies with the public because I don't think they I think it's such a sort of inside the Westminster bubble point. I mean, how many people really remember what Keir Starmer's Position was on Brexit, not that many outside Westminster. And so I think he's far better to say, look. We are in a complete mess.\n\nOur economy is tanking. The country is going in the wrong direction. I agree with you. He he could say, we are not revisiting the basic question about membership of the European Union, but we have to fix this deal, and we have to get better trading relations with the European Union. He could definitely say that.\n\nInstead of which, it goes back to the point I made in the main podcast about Labour saying what they're not for rather than what they are, Instead of which we're getting, you know, we're not doing the single market. We're not doing customs union. Freedom of movement is a red line. We need more British workers for British jobs, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. The public is way ahead of them on this.\n\nSpeaker 1: In 2018, when people like me were getting very frustrated with Kit Starmer because, you Remember, there was a moment when Theresa May had essentially lost most of the Tory party and, in desperation, reached out to Jeremy Corbyn and Kezsana,\n\nSpeaker 0: Try to\n\nSpeaker 1: get a deal across the line. He set these 6 tests on Brexit. And maybe it's a good way of thinking about Brexit. I mean, these were quite thoughtful ways of thinking about the issue, so he asked, does it ensure a strong and collaborative future relationship with EU? Does it deliver exactly the same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union?\n\nDoes it ensure the fair management of migration? Does it defend rights and protections, prevent prevent a race at the bottom, does it protect national security, does it deliver for all regions and nations in the UK? And you would have thought he could return to those At the very least, there's a way of making argument for a much closer relationship with Europe without necessarily reopening\n\nSpeaker 0: the referendum. I find increasingly few people who are willing to tell me that there's any benefit to what we've done. And yet you've got both main parties essentially saying it can't be revisited. It's it's it's fantasy land, it really is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now quest question for you. I'm conscious you ask a lot of questions, and And as you say, I give 2 long answers. So, Angela Neuburger, I'd assume that it'd be very tough for Labour to win a general election without getting more seats back in Scotland. What's the electoral mess on this? Will Nicholas surgeons threat to turn the next election to vote on independence help Labour or Tories or both?\n\nSo Labour in Scotland, run by Anna Sawa, where do you see their future and their importance for the Labour Party in the next election?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, there are 2 things, I think, to to say about this. The first is that The SMP are still very, very dominant in Scotland. No doubt about that. I think the thing that has stopped a lot of people who might be minded to vote Labour from doing so is because in recent years, they haven't thought there's a hope in hell's chance of Labour actually winning a majority. And therefore, they've been The SMP have been able to corral people essentially to be saying, look, vote for the SMP because that's the way you're gonna get Scotland's voice heard more strongly in Scotland.\n\nI think the more that it seems like Labour might win the majority, then I think you will get moderate SMP supporters. In other words, people who whose defining issue is not necessarily independence, but just the fact that they prefer the SMP to the other parties. I think there's a chance for Labour to bring those over. I do think she's taking a risk in in saying that the next general election is is a referendum on independence because, you know, the fact is that there's a lot, Just there's a lot going wrong in our economy. There's a lot going wrong in in when I say our economy, I mean, the national economy, UK.\n\nThere's a there's a lot going wrong in Scotland in terms of public services and so forth. And, you know, if it looks like she's doing this as a way of avoiding the things that people actually tend to want to to debate and see debated at general election. I can see that playing against her and for Labour.\n\nSpeaker 1: And for for listeners, just to remind people how odd what happened to Labour in Scotland was. So Labour was the 1st party in Scotland almost continuously from the 19 twenties and certainly from the certainly from the late fifties. And it didn't really, from the early sixties, drop below 40 seats out of 71. The the number of seats were reduced later, but Still kept 40 seats out of 59 as late as 2010. So almost every year, every election, 41, 50, 49, even 56 Seats in in the early Tony Blair days.\n\nAnd then suddenly in 2015, in 5 years, went from 41 seats in Scotland to 1 seat. Lost I mean, I I don't know what that is. Lost 90% of their seats. Crept up in 2017 to 7 seats and then collapsed.\n\nSpeaker 0: Why are you reminding me of this? I I I know all this. It's amazing. It's just\n\nSpeaker 1: the most astonishing thing, isn't it? And then collapses again in 2019 to one's one seat.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But listen, how many how many here's one for you. You you sent a very interesting article that'd been written by Sam Friedman about this thing of nimby's and yimby's, not in my backyard, and young people who want things in their backyard, like, you know, houses to live in. When you look at how few seats the conservatives now have in big cities. I mean, is it is isn't it possible that the conservatives, particularly if they carry on with this kind of, you know, nimbyism at the heart of their planning, approach to planning and housing and so forth.\n\nAnd onshore wind farms is the other one that's becoming in now as a great sort of, you know, nimby's v yimbys. I like that one, n b v y n b. Thank you for sending that. But isn't isn't it possible that the conservatives could see something similar happening to them in places where they used to be strong?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the this this is, of course, what what the Conservative Party has been terrified of now for for 10, 15 years. So Margaret Thatcher rebuilt the Conservative Party brand partly by getting people on the housing ladder, partly through this policy of Allowing people to buy their council houses, which turned millions of people into owners and gave them a capital asset, which became very important.\n\nSpeaker 0: Big part of the housing problem we've got now, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Big part of the housing problem we've got now, but incredibly successful politics and and actually incredibly beneficial for many of the families that able to buy their houses. It totally transformed their assets, totally transformed their financial futures, which is why she picks up an enormous number of voters by doing it. And since that time, housing prices have rocketed, more and more people have begun treating their house as an asset, And we're now in a situation in which it is almost impossible and has been for 15, 20 years for a young person to get, as it were, on the housing ladder. And most of the policies that the conservative Governments have pursued since 2010, haven't fixed this. They've done things such as to try to subsidize mortgages, which seem, in many cases, just In normal economic terms, just have driven the prices up further.\n\nThey tried to address it By building programs that didn't work, they never met their housing targets. There's a lot of nostalgia for Harold Macmillan who built, you know, millions of those, houses back in the fifties. And at the heart of the problem seems to be our planning system. It's very difficult to get planning permission. Development land is very expensive.\n\nThere's a lot of cases, although the the property development companies deny it, of land banking, in other words, holding back land that they could develop and aren't developing. And this means that particularly young people and people in cities feel that they're never gonna be able to own a house. And The conservative party's been trying since 2010, or factions within it, Gavin Barwell, for example, who was Theresa May chief of staff, was a influential housing minister, Trying to argue that the only way that conservatives will manage to win back younger voters and working class voters is if They start allowing houses to be built, and, certainly, the snibbyism is blocking that.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I I see it's given rise to yet another of these Marvelous names that they give themselves. We've had the European Research Group, which has done so much damage to the to the country and its economy and its standing in the world. And these guys call themselves the, Is it the planning concern group or the housing concern group? Most of these story groups, it seems to me that you have to think of the opposite of what they're saying in that\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, in in that in that case, In in that case, that's Theresa Villiers who, played a very big part in wrecking over Brexit, who's actually essentially Driven a rebellion against the government's attempt to try to bring a bill in that would have made housing easier has led a sort of NIMBY rebellion, and It shows a big fracture again in the conservative party and a big problem for Rishi Sunak's leadership that somebody like Theresa Villiers can do that.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we've also had, both Boris Johnson analyst trusts supporting amendment to try to force a change on the opposition to onshore wind farms as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Extraordinary. Now here's a question for you. How does a normal person become an MP? Question around normal person is very interesting. So there've been some comments about the fact that there are many more university graduates in that House of Commons And there are in the population as a whole.\n\nI think it's sort of nearly 80% of MPC university graduates with less than 50% of the population. But Jessica Coates is coming from a different direction. She says, I've been reflecting on Francois Hollande's observation that increasingly few educated people are choosing political careers. My Cambridge educated friends and I all went straight into private sector careers without much thought. Now having achieved financial security, many of us are considering a career in politics.\n\nBut without parents involved in the political circuit, it seems difficult. So how does a, inverted commas, normal person, which in her case seems to be, actually, You could call a wealthy educated person, go about becoming an MP. What do you make for that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, obviously, when it comes out next year, she'll have to get my book, but what do I do? How to fix politics. You know, we were talking about Johnny Mercer. When he decided to become an MP, he just went and found a seat, and he just sort of went round knocking on doors, and he got He sort of barged his way in. I think\n\nSpeaker 1: Not not well, let let me let me come in on this because he still needed to be approved by his local party. I mean, that's the big choke\n\nSpeaker 0: point. Correct. Yeah. But he sort of he but he didn't find it that difficult. Now listen.\n\nI know for most people, it's incredibly difficult. More far more people I know lots of people at the moment who are trying to go for Selection as Labour candidates that are way more want to do it than there are places. It's about who you know. It's about how you get on with them. But I think the other thing you have to do, Jessica, if if you if you want to do this, I'm afraid you do have to kind of you you have to work out the power structures.\n\nYou have to go and find the people that and then you have to make an impression on them. And even then, you might not win. That's the only thing you have to accept, because a lot of people do want to be MPs. It's just that a lot of them Really, you know, I don't think we're getting the brightest and the best necessarily who want to do it. Although I have been impressed by some of the the new candidates that I've seen and by some of the people.\n\nI met a guy last week He's 27, trying to get a seat. And, honestly, if I were the Labour Party, I'd just I'd just move heaven and earth to get him. He's really smart, really bright. I think we need a lot of younger people in there.\n\nSpeaker 1: How do you weigh up this question of, on the one hand, people saying MPs need more qualifications, more Experience the outside world. And how do you balance that against another argument which says that the House of Commons should fully reflect the diversity of the country? In other words, if Less than half the people in the country have a university degree. Less than half MPs should have a university degree. No.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't I don't buy the idea. I don't I don't worry about whether it sort of Accurately reflects the whole of the country. I think it'd be great if it looked a little bit more like the country than the House of Commons does now. You know, sometimes you look at prime minister's questions and you look at the Tory benches in Ticketing to see these sort of white men in suits, and you\n\nSpeaker 1: see Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah.\n\nWoah. Woah. Woah. Woah. Sorry.\n\nLet me push back hard on that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. The\n\nSpeaker 1: conservatives have had Far more minority ethnic sectaries say. You didn't have a single one when Labour was in, not a single\n\nSpeaker 0: No. We've talked about the cabinet. No. I'm See, I'm saying sometimes that this this may be just the sort of the way that the see the ones who get in to get the seats. Sometimes you look at the Tory benches, and you really struggle to see anything other\n\nSpeaker 1: than why not. Tory front bench, you see it's something that's actually\n\nSpeaker 0: more aggressive. Look. Rory. Rory, I've I have noticed, Rory. Since Boris Johnson departed, You become much more defensive about the conservative party.\n\nThat's fine. Only only when\n\nSpeaker 1: you say things which are not fully nuanced and reflecting on labor's The flaws in this. Why has Labour so catastrophically failed to get more diversity into its front benches?\n\nSpeaker 0: We can name names. I can point to that wonderful chap from Slough, who's brilliant every time I see him on social media. We can point to David Lammy. We can point to all sorts of people. But the point, Mike, the point we're making on what point was I making, Maria?\n\nI forgot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you were trying to talk about whether the House The comments was representative. And then for some reason, you decided to choose the conservative party. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I'll tell you what. The the other thing I think we've gotta understand is that so for example, I I got into a ferocious rally the other a day with somebody at a a dinner I was speaking at. Because he was going on about, you know, Trouble is these politicians, they're all the same and the usual stuff that you get fed up of hearing. And I was sort of pushing back on that.\n\nHe he actually said this, I don't want people like Angela Rayner in in a government. I said, what do you mean people like Angela Rayner? He said, well, you know, the way she speaks. I said, what do you mean what do you mean the way she speaks? And it was like what it was was a sort of, on the one hand, I want politicians to be more normal and more like us.\n\nOn the other hand, the minute they are, I want to say that they're not fit for the job. And I got really because I thought that was just a sort of basic kind of snobbery. I think there is still snobbery about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Coming out of my defensive crouch for a moment, the this question of qualifications, experience, diversity is very personal to me. I mean, obviously, I'm the epitome of somebody who's not representative. I'm a old Etonian, middle aged white guy. But I found with constituents that There's a difficult thing to resolve. On the one hand, people felt in Cumbria, what on earth are we doing with this person as RMP because he's not like us?\n\nOn the other hand, other people thought, well, you know, he's written books, he's worked abroad, he's had some quite interesting experiences, we think he might be quite good at being a minister. Maybe he'd be quite suited to be a foreign minister or a different minister. Maybe he'd manage things. He's run NGOs in difficult places. Maybe he'd be okay running the prison system.\n\nSo it's a very odd kind of job interview because it it it's not as simple as it would be in another job as saying you're just looking at somebody's qualifications and how good they are at running a department. You're also No.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Listen. The thing I lament about the state of our we, you know, we talked about on the main podcast about how few politicians now make sort of really big serious speeches. I want at least a good 20% of our MPs to be really smart, really special. People, whether they're Labour or Tory or SMP or Lib Dem green or applied.\n\nI don't care. I just want people who I think I really wanna hear what they think. I've got to be honest, Rory. When most of the cabinet Quite a few of the shadow cabinet come on to the television and the radio. I kinda know what they're gonna say before they said it because I've worked out what the government and the opposition lines on something I want people are gonna say interesting things and give me interesting analysis of the world.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what's what what about the other 80%?\n\nSpeaker 0: I'd like them to be competent. I'd like them to have good values. I'd like them to be good local MPs, and and and some of them to develop into to something better. But I just feel I feel we're probably going in the wrong direction. Has to be another question, Rory.\n\nThe answers are getting too long ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, we we go well, let's go into the break, and I'll ask you a question straight after The rest is politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell. And, Rory, we've got you know, one of the one of the benefits, I guess, of being a Popular chart topping podcast is that we get lots of people want to advertise and sponsor and so forth, and We've enjoyed the the benefits of the sponsorship of Airbnb. And quite a few of our listeners have suggested that, actually, they don't see Airbnb He is the force for good that you do. So I'm now going to put you on the spot and say to you, defend them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, firstly, what what what is it that's troubling people? I mean, I don't really Tell me firstly what, because I I see Airbnb as a very positive force. I mean, I think it's fantastic way of bringing extra incomes, and remember, we're talking about a housing crisis and difficult for people to Find accommodation. And I think anything that makes it easier for people to use unused rooms or unused property to let other people use them is a good thing. Otherwise, it just Sits empty and unused.\n\nSpeaker 0: I get the the the criticisms that we we seem to be getting is that they're actually having the opposite effect, that they're they're adding to a housing problem. They're adding to difficulties with tourism that are facing some of our coastal and rural\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so I guess I guess one of the I I mean, obviously, this is relevant to Cumbria where there was a loss of anxiety around 2nd homeowners and holiday homes and holiday cottages. And it's definitely true that 2nd homes, which are empty, unused, are not a contribution to the community and can lead to hollowed out communities. But by definition, Airbnb is putting things to use. There are people in the building, so it's not a question of empty second homes. It's a very good source of secondary income, for example, for farming families.\n\nAnd, in fact, the Labour government had a very good scheme, which I supported, of Giving grants to farming families to set up little accommodation units for holiday lets. And, you know, most Airbnb, it's not true of everyone, but I think Four fifths of them are people renting out properties for something like a couple of days a month. I stayed in one in London recently where the lady Has her family and her children staying in her basement most of the time, but just occasionally will rent it out, which takes pressure off other people. So I I think, Look. A lot of these things, Airbnb, Uber, etcetera, have problems of credit controversy, but the basic idea that technology is being used to open up opportunities Makes sense.\n\nAnd it's it's simply doing more efficiently what's always existed, which is giving people the capacity to rent out their their rooms.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Now we've got quite a lot of questions on partisan policies. Colin Sinfield, as you 2 can hold a civil argument Beg to differ on the details. Why could running the country not be structured like this? That is government in opposition agreeing basic provision for things like health, education, housing, and then establishing the difference in election.\n\nAt least I got this at the dinner that I was talking about where somebody was rude about Angela Rayner. Somebody saying, you know, why can't we take the politics out of schools and hospitals? And the answer is because they are amongst the most passionate issues that you're going to get in politics. Now I think it's Easy to say, let's be more civil with each other. That shouldn't be too difficult.\n\nBut what do you think of that? Did you ever think in the house of commons that there there was a less Political way\n\nSpeaker 1: of doing politics. When I felt that. I mean, I did feel during Brexit that we should have locked the MPs in the House of Commons. You know, more than 400 of them claimed that they were in favor of a Soft compromise on Brexit. I would have liked to lock the doors and make them come to a compromise, not let them out again, like cardinals electing a pope Mhmm.\n\nTill they'd come up with a solution. I definitely feel on adult social care, which is the big remains the big central shame of British politics tickets. That hasn't been fixed since the 2nd World War, that you should get a cross party coalition. And it's horrible the way that the conservatives, every time that Labour brought a proposal together on trying to fund it would go into death tax attacks, and then labeled in the same to Theresa May when she came up with a good could have been a good cross party proposal on Adult Sushkesh, they did a dementia attack.\n\nSpeaker 0: We're gonna get the same in the next election. I mean, things haven't changed on that, have they?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. And and and it's I mean,\n\nSpeaker 0: the issues have changed, but we're we're gonna get the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: So your bigger question though, I mean, other things are genuinely political. You can't take politics out of things because many issues in British Public life are not simply technocratic. There's not an obvious objective answer. It's about choices and trade offs and lesser evils. You're always sacrificing something.\n\nYou have always deciding what you want to prioritize. You know, I feel this in a very granular way when I was the flooding minister where there was no Simple engineering solution. You were weighing up the interests of a downstream community against an upstream community of gains. The company that's trying to prevent droughts against the company that's trying to prevent flooding. You're trying to deal with rewilding moves.\n\nYou're trying to deal with farmers growing crops, and this stuff needs politicians. Here's a here's a question from Clement or Clement. I often hear about whips. What do they do exactly? How does the whip whip?\n\nDo Tory whips and labor whips behave in the same way? What does this three line whip mean?\n\nSpeaker 0: The whips love to think they they like people to think that you're not allowed to know how they work, but, actually, it's not that complicated. They're there to instill discipline. They're there to make sure that their parties support their party's positions. And, obviously, that's most important for the government because the government is trying to get legislation through.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So just just to give people a a a glimpse of who these people are, they are elected MPs, but they choose to enter a very strange unit In the House of\n\nSpeaker 0: Commons. They don't choose royalty. They get a point Oh,\n\nSpeaker 1: they get a point at the\n\nSpeaker 0: end. They they would choose to be in the cabinet, but they're not deemed good enough.\n\nSpeaker 1: For some of them, it's It's a route to promotion. But, anyway, once you've agreed to become a whip, you basically have taken off in a vow of silence. You're not really allowed to speak much in the House of Commons, and Your attention is focused very much on trying to make your own party vote the way that the leader wants. They're the kind of loyal, As it were, dogs of god of the leader who are there to deliver those votes, and they do it in many different ways. You get kind of, But you get sort of smooth ones who try to charm you.\n\nYou get kind of rough and tough ones who try to physically manhandle you into the lobbies. You get very straightforward people who take you out for on the smoking terrace and have a cigarette and say, I just wish people would be sensible. There are many different TONES, and they actually have resources. I mean, they can also act sometimes as an HR or personnel department. They can Theoretically help MPs who have mental health issues.\n\nThey, in the past, have helped MPs even with financial issues, which gives them an enormous amount of of leverage and power, But they are central to the basic idea, which is that you vote for a government, and you want that government to deliver its legislation. You don't want too many independent MPs around.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think they're also part of a two way process. They are genuinely there in part to feedback to It's often the chief whip that will give a minister or a prime minister very bad news about the way something is going down, you know, particularly in circumstances where there's a a small majority. But I I I you know? And the the other thing I think people maybe underestimate in In British politics, this may have changed because I I think things have become more polarized. But I think, certainly, when I was both when I was a journalist and when I was Working in for the Labour Party and the Labour government, you tended to have pretty good relations between, certainly, between the chief whips and other op other parts of the whip's operations because a lot of it is about doing deals to get the business of the commons through without us with minimum fuss, and that's what Sometimes, there's a there's a shared interest in doing that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Last question, so we wrap up. What would you like to see your last question?\n\nSpeaker 0: Shola Amaibi, Could we ask Rory why he thinks Southgate can't find a way to utilize Phil Foden?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's a really, really good question. I I've got a lot of questions a few like that, and a Grealish question too. I must say, I'm encouraged by you and by you sending me an amazing piece of Welsh nationalist propaganda around the Welsh team. I did watch\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, fantastic. Was it\n\nSpeaker 1: the US match. And I must say it was pretty dismal. I mean, I thought America\n\nSpeaker 0: should was awful. But, Rory, I could've told you not to watch that. I should I Could have told you that you should have watched Costa Rica, Saudi Arabia. No. Yeah.\n\nThat was possibly the worst game in the tournament so far. I strongly recommend that you that you stick with it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, you know, top tip from you, Gunnar, who we who we supposed to be betting on?\n\nSpeaker 0: I I I think it's between Brazil and France.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. I'm going Brazil.\n\nSpeaker 0: Probably from probably France.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm going Brazil. You're going France. Let's see, listeners, which one of us is right. Thank you all very much, and see you all next week.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best.",
