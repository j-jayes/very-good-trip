That's the rest is politics .com. Hi there. Alistair Campbell here. And first of all, thank you from me and Rory Stewart for listening to the rest is politics, which is back at number 1, I see. Now in this week's episode, you might remember I made reference to our sister podcast, The Rest is history. We've been discussing George Bush's famous quote about looking into Vladimir Putin's soul. Well, we thought we'd give you the chance to listen to the in full. It's the first of a 4 part series on Russia in the final days of the Soviet Union to today and Putin's violent kleptocracy. If you want to listen to the other episodes, the link is in the episode notes, or just search for the rest is history wherever You get your podcasts. Hope you enjoy it, and hope you come back to us. The rest is politics next Wednesday. All the best. Hello. Welcome to The Rest is History, and, we would like to go over to Crawford, Texas where we are joined by a special guest. I I'll answer the question. I looked a man in the eye. I found it to be very straightforward and trustworthy, We had a very good dialogue. I was able to, get a sense of his soul. A man deeply committed to his country and his best interests of his country, and I appreciate it so very much, the frank dialogue. There was no kind of diplomatic chitchat trying to throw each other off balance. There was a straightforward dialogue, And that's the beginning of a very constructive relationship. I wouldn't have invited him to my ranch if I didn't trust him. That was my brilliant impression of George w Bush. It wasn't actually. No. That was that really was George Bush. That was George that was our 1st presidential guest. And that was the occasion in 2001 of his first meeting with president Vladimir Putin. In light of the current situation, We thought that it would be interesting to look at some of the historical context. We've already done an episode on the history of Ukraine, but we thought that it would be, You know, I mean, essentially, everyone is asking, how did we get here? What is it that's prompted Putin to do what he's doing? You know, what what is the background? What what is there an explanation for it that can be discovered in in history, I suppose, and in his specifically, in his biography? This is a field that you are much, much more familiar with than I am. But I I guess I lived through it, so a lot of it. Yeah. I think, Tom, there's that apocryphal saying by Napoleon, isn't there, that if you know the world if if you've studied the world when a man was 20, You know how his mind works. And, Vladimir Putin, like any Russian of his generation, he's born in 1952, Has lived through the most colossal, almost unimaginable political, economic kind of social changes in the former sov Soviet Union and and Russia. And And if we and it's only by understanding what's happened to him and his country, I think, that you can actually get get into his into his well, attempt to get into his head And to understand why Russia is now as it is. So now it's becoming you know, it appears to be becoming this pariah state, Kind of shuts off behind a new iron curtain of sanctions. How on earth has it got here? And that's what we're going to try and try and Investigate. I mean, Dominic, you're of course, it it's been an absolutely convulsive period of change, but there is also always the historians, question change or continuity. And you could say I mean, people have been saying that actually not that much has changed, The Soviet Union was a a political system founded on lies, founded on A a profound suspicion of the outside, founded on an emphasis on military prowess over everything else. And you could say But Russia today is showing, you know, much the same is the air of that. Yeah. I don't that. Normally, I'm a great determinist in this podcast, but I don't think that's really true, actually. I think that misses you know, obviously, Putin himself is a product of the Soviet system, which we'll go into in a second. But I think When you actually go through the period of change, you see that there were alternative paths that Russia could have taken, and and Russia isn't fated To be this sort of, right, violent, you know, a nationalistic kind of hellhole that that that so many people imagine. You know, what happened In the in the in the USSR in 19 eighties and then in Russia in 19 nineties, there were all kinds of contingencies and twists and and so on, And there were alternative futures for Russia, as we will see. But just before we go to look at, the last decade of the Soviet Union, You talked about the idea that that Russia wasn't fated to become what it is now. But that idea of fate, The idea that Russia has a particular destiny, I mean, that is something that is very strong in Russian culture and actually much older, of course, than communism. Yeah. This sort of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. Well, I mean, there are 2 different things on there, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. But the sort of the idea of Russia having this almost, As you would say, Tom, this almost kind of sacral destiny, you know, the the 3rd Rome, the home of Orthodoxy, kind of on the edge of Europe, Half in Europe, half out. I mean, that is very deeply rooted in Russia's sense of itself, the sense of embattlement, a sense a a distrust of The outside, but also a fascination with it. So, yes, all those things are are are there, but there is a sort of slightly stereotypical way we talk about Russia. We always talk about I mean, even George Bush did it there when he talked about knowing Peter the soul. Yes. The idea of the Russians having a soul that you must understand that is incredibly deep and dark. I I mean, nobody says that about, you know, Belgium. Yeah. Belgium. No. Nobody says that about Belgium. Maybe Bart Van Leeu, our previous guest, I would say that's a I mean, peep today, when you apply the word exceptionalism to countries, it's generally a a pejorative. So people are very sniffy about the idea that there might be British exceptionalism or French exceptionalism. Or Americans. Even though clearly, you know I mean, they are all very exceptional countries. But in Russia, it seems to be something that is pretty fundamental to the way that, not just Russian politicians, but large numbers of people within the country Think of Russia. Yes. Do you think that's fair or am I saying it might be? I think it no. I think it probably is fair. I think that's the way that a lot of Russians are are told to think about themselves, that they have an exceptional, a unique past and a kind of exceptional destiny. And that we do think of Russia typically as having an exceptional outsiders do, and that's all that stuff about the Russian soul and about, you know, Russians are terribly kind of warm people, but they're but they're also That the price of human life is lower and all that sort of thing that you hear so often. Yes. So I think there is a kind of exceptionalism both projected from the outside but also believed Inside. I mean, it was expressed very unsettlingly by Putin, and I may be paraphrasing him here. And I you know, this may be, Disinformation. But didn't he say something to the effect talking with with regard to nuclear weapons? That, a a world Without Russia, wouldn't be a what you know, why should the why should the world exist if if it exists without Russia? Yes. And not only has he said that, by the way, but His kind of mouthpieces on Russian state television have used exactly the same line. So that's, yeah, a World War nine, actually, in the sort of Putinist ideology. Right. Okay. So a bit unsettling Yeah. Coming from people with the largest quantity of nuclear weapons on the face of the planet. But, something that, as we said, can be traced back to the czarist Period. But, obviously, gets a particular refinement under communism where what had been the Russian Empire becomes the Soviet Union. Yeah. And as the Soviet Union is one of 2 superpowers and sees itself charged with a historical destiny. It is the midwife of world communism. That has sustained it throughout decades of transformation and upheaval. By the seventies, when Putin is coming of age, that sense of purpose and of destiny, perhaps, is starting to fade. It's The age of Brezhnev, a man with kind of insanely huge eyebrows And you do and a kind of rigor mortis starts, isn't it? I mean, they're all kinda basically dead. They are constantly getting colds, But keep them in their beds for 5 years. They wear nothing but overcoats. They wear things under the overcoats, Tom. Did they? I've never seen any evidence for that. Yeah. You're right. So that's what we're doing. So what's going on? So so Putin is born in Leningrad, Saint Petersburg in 1952, and he's from a working class family. His parents work in a factory, and he goes to Leningrad State University in 1970, I think, and he's there for 5 years. And so so he comes of age in the Brezhnev era, as you say, and it's an age of It's it is not an age of revolutionary zeal at all. So you mentioned communism and and and, a sort of sense of of communist zeal, but that really isn't What typifies the Brezhnev regime? The Brezhnev regime is all about stability, and there's a kind of ordinariness to it. So for most people who are alive in the Soviet Union at that point, Soviet Union is all they've ever known, and everybody in the world, you know, in America, in Britain, in Western Europe, and in the The Soviet Union thinks the Soviet Union is going to probably be around forever. You know, it's, as you say, one of the 2 superpowers. It's sclerotic. The economy is producing enough to keep people happy, so they're fed. They've actually got more consumer goods than ever before. You know, Robert Service in his history of Russia says, one I think he uses the phrase most Russian workers had never had it so good as they had it In the 19 seventies. They got fridges. They go on holiday there. You know, life's okay. But relatively relatively, they've never had it. I mean, they've never had it so good, Relative to the capitalist west? Of course, it's falling Economically, they're starting to fall behind. For for and The the prosperity the apparent prosperity of the seventies is based on a fiction. So it's based on a sclerotic, incredibly complicated top down, sort of system, you know, the the sort of parodies of sort of state planning and tractor statistics and all that stuff, they're all they're all rooted in truth. But it's also rooted in high oil prices. So high world that this they're almost living a bit of a a bit of an illusion because when the oil price falls in the 19 eighties, That's gonna pull the rug out from the from the system. And Brezhnev, as you say, I mean, he's not Stalin. You know, he's nothing like Stalin. He's not. It's still a very autocratic system. It's one that represses distance and shoves them into psychiatric hospitals, but it doesn't kill lots of people. So life kind of, you know, goes on. And for a young man like Putin, his ambition is to join the KGB. Supposedly, he applies to join and they say to him, you don't apply. You know? We contact you. But they kinda make note of him because they know that he's loyal and hardworking and all this sort of stuff. So for him, he thinks he's going to be he thinks he's joining the intelligence service of one of of of Of the actually, the world's great power because the 19 seventies is a terrible decade for the kind of the United States. It's the decade of Nixon and Carter and Vietnam and This sort of introspection. And the Soviet Union, there's a sort of sense that the Soviet Union might even be winning the Cold War. Burying them. Burying them as, yes, as Christophe said to said to Nixon. So there's this sort of false false Image, I think, that people have about their own society in the seventies. And there are some people at the top of the Soviet regime. So in particular, the man who's going to succeed Brezhnev, who's a man called Yuri Andropov, who is the head of the KGB, there are some people who know that there are deep problems, that Russia has, Yeah. When I say Russia, the Soviet Union has huge problems with alcoholism, with absenteeism, that its birth rate is is struggling, that's, you know, high rates of corruption, all these kinds of things. But Putin doesn't see this as a young man, I wouldn't have said. Well, 2 questions. 1st of all, Putin, is he a committed communist as a young man, or is he a committed nationalist? What's the balance there? If you read sort of his semi official biography, it says that he reads you know, he enjoys reading Marxist Leninist books when he's at he's at school. I mean, I think It's a bit like Christianity, Tom. Is it? You it is in this sense in this sense. There's a difference between being a Christian in the 2nd century AD And being a Christian in the 16th century when everybody's a Christian, and, you know, you're not a radical. You're not a rebel. You're not in Well, you might be in the 16th century. Yeah. But you might not be you might not you might be a good Christian, but none of those things. You might just be an apparatchik, and, I think He's a communist in the sense that he's listened to everything he's been told, and that provides his framework. But I don't think he's a I don't think he burns with the zeal of social justice or or with Revolutionary enthusiasts. Alright. I don't actually, Tom, I don't think I think a lot of the people who are running the show don't burn with revolutionary zeal. Okay. That was my other question. But, I think before I ask that, let's take a quick break. Welcome back to The Rest is History. You were just saying, before the break But, a lot of the people at the top of the Soviet Union are not burning with kind of revolutionary communist zeal. And The question I asked you was on Andropov. He's the guy who who notoriously has the cold. It lasts for, what, kind of 4 year, 3 years or something? I mean, he's in, I mean, basically, he's incapacitated for the whole period of his term of general secretary. Yes. And then he's succeeded by Chonenko, who is Kind of, in many ways, even more moribund. Are these are these guys people who, you know so Andropov is a very smart guy. He recognizes the Soviet Union has huge problems. Is he a believer, though? He he doesn't question the system. He just thinks that the system needs a bit of tinkering. You know, apply the spanner here, a bit of oil there, and it will tick along fine. He doesn't question the mission, I suppose, is what I would say. So, yeah, I mean, Chvenenko, he's a hack. He's just a party hack. Andropov is is clever. He was the Soviet ambassador, I think, in, Hungary during the Budapest uprising. So he he has taken from that a belief that you have to be you have to be strong. You know? You have to suppress dissent. You can't let things. But he also has taken a belief that, You have to get in ahead. So, you know, you can't let yourself get in a situation where thousands of people are in the streets. You have to keep changing the system To make it work. So I don't think Andropov is in he's very severe. He's very strict. He's very anti corruption, and he's clever, And he has read forbidden books, and he as Soviets, sort of the the top brass, are allowed to do, they're expected to do, to inform themselves. And he surrounded himself with aids who are relatively free thinking, but he's still I mean, everybody there believes in them that their model must triumph, And they believe they're in a global competition with this with the United States. Absolutely. Yeah. And so he is you know, said he was head of the KGB. He's General secretary during the kind of the coldest days of the of the cold war in the early eighties. Yes. So he he is the guy who's in charge when Reagan is lambasting the Soviet Union as evil as ever. Yeah. And it's 99 red balloons and 2 tribes Which is very frightening, by the way, for the Soviet leadership. They they think the Americans are going to attack them. I mean, we did a podcast about this with Taylor Downing, about nuclear war. They absolutely are terrified that the Americans are going to attack them first. But, yeah, Sondropov takes over. Brezhnev dies. I mean, Brezhnev basically died multiple times, and was literally brought back from the dead. You know, he's sort of resuscitated and dragged around as this sort of embalmed figure in the late 19 seventies. Andrew Pop succeeds in November 82 and is there till February 84. And as you said, He's basically ill the whole time. I mean, they're literally you know, the on one side of his bed, there'll be the man with the nuclear briefcase. The other side of his bed will be the nurses keeping him alive. Mhmm. And then he dies. Now the person he wants to succeed him is the crucial figure in this podcast, and for Putin, a figure of of utter ignominy And shame in Russian history as an a deed he is for a lot of Russians, and that man is Mikhail Gorbachev. That's the man that Andropov wants to take over, but he doesn't. He's too young. So the other people in the Politburo, they they bypass him, and they get this old hack, Charnenko, who is another sort of I mean, he's dying when he takes over, And he's there from February 84 to the spring of 85. So what was it about Gorbachev that Andropov had seen? That's a that's a That's a really good question. So Gorbachev is a generation younger. He's the youngest guy, I think, pretty much on the, Politburo. He joins in 1918. He's 49, which is incredibly young by the standards of the Soviet leadership. And he has glamorous wife. He does raise a very clever wife who's a very important I'm a hugely important figure for him, his chief adviser. I mean, his real, his real soulmate. So Gorbachev is from a place called Stavropol. He's from a little village called what's it called? Pribilnoir, I think it's called. And he's from Peasant Stock. He's bright. He's He's super bright. He's gone to Moscow State University, and I think he's read law. He's got a birthmark on his, forehead. He doesn't need He's traveled, so he's been abroad. He even went on a 3 week driving holiday in France with RASA, and they sort of drove around France and they said and said, God, you know, this place is so much better than the Soviet Union. You know, this is the sort of classic thing that often happens when people are posted to the West. He actually one of his chief aids one of his chief advisers is a man called Alexander Yakovlev, who'd been ambassador to Canada and and basically had exactly the same kind of Crisis of confidence. You know, you got to Canada, and they're like, oh my god. This place is great. But when Gorbachev becomes general secretary. Yeah. He he's still a believer. I mean, he just because he's he's got nice camembert in France, it doesn't mean that he says Tom. Absolutely. He's a believer. He is He is idealistic, and this is one of the great problems with Gorbachev. Now Gorbachev is a fascinating character because, of course, everybody listening to this, by and large, will think, oh, Gorby, nice guy, You know, Nobel Peace Prize winner, top man. Of course, in Russia, he is regarded with absolute contempt. And I have to say, when you when you start to dig into the story and you think about Gorbachev in a in a slightly more detached way, I mean, we've done a lot of weak and failed leaders on this podcast. Although it pains me to say it because he's an admirable man in so many ways. I mean but when he leaves office, he's only in there for 6 years. And when he leaves, His his country has completely and utterly fallen apart. Now some people would say that's because the problems are too great, but I think Gorbachev, I think almost all historians actually who really work on this, people like, Robert Service or Vladislav Zubok, who writes a brilliant book called Collapse, that came out last year at the Ford of the Soviet Union. They would just say Gorbachev is a complete and utter disaster. Why? He's idealistic, Tom. He's he's bright. He and Raisa have have spent loads of time talking about the future of the Soviet Union. They like talking to other kind of intellectually kind of people. Gorbachev is also very canny, so he's been able to get up the kind of greasy pole. He's powerful patrons like Andropov, think a lot of him. He says to Raisin when he rejoins the I think it's when he joined the politburo, he said, we can't live like this any longer, and he's determined to fix the system. But he goes about fixing it in such a politically incompetent I mean, again, it slightly pains me to say it, but he he fixes it in such an inept way that absolutely everything gets worse. He does too much, too quickly, too many different areas, and and everything falls apart. And you said, was he a believer? He's absolutely a believer. So, Vladislav Zubat brings this out really well in his book. He says, you know, Gorbachev is obsessed with Lenin. I mean, this is so much like that. You're parallel with your Christianity stuff about people who, you know, people who would kind of Oliver Cromwell or somebody reading the bible to guide them. Gorbachev has Lenin's sort of works on his desk, and he will sort of dip into them in the way that people sometimes dip into the bible. He will dip into them to try and get inspiration for what he needs to do. And he becomes convinced he is convinced that The Soviet Union has taken a wrong turn since the 19 twenties, and it needs to get back to Lenin's vision. He idealizes Lenin, and he thinks Lenin had a vision It's a more democratic, free, open, creative. And if I can get back to that, we'll establish true communism and and then We'll turn this sort of sinking ship around if you can turn the sinking ship around. So that's that's quite a kind of abstract sense of mission. But I maybe I've got this wrong, But I thought that he was also focused on a very specific problem, which was that, the Soviet economy was massively distorted by defense spending. So Yeah. They they're spending, what, 20, 25%? No. It's probably not that's actually been exaggerated. It's about 15%, I think, is the latest estimate. Quite a lot. It is, but it's If he's going to if they're going to, you know, guns to butter Yeah. Then they need to make things up with the West. So he does that very effectively. I mean, he's very good at that. Yes. He he he definitely kinda removes the chill from the cold war very effectively, so which is why people in the west, You know, rate him so highly. But as someone who is ideologically committed to Marxist Leninism, I I mean, isn't it a definition of the job that kind of trying to construct an economy that will provide Soviet citizens with all the kind of consumer durables and gizmos that you get in the west is bound to fail. I mean, it's there's just no way it can be done. No. I don't agree with that. I don't actually don't agree with either of those things. So first of all, the defense spending, that has become a very comforting myth that the West tells itself about the Soviet Union Particularly in America, that we crippled we won the Cold War by increasing defense spending so much that they couldn't keep up. But most historians, I think, would now say they could keep up. I mean, they had With defense spending. Yeah. They've done it since the forties. They could they could have carried on doing it. I mean, That defense spending is not what brings the Soviet Union down. 2nd point, I forgot what your second point was, Tom. As consumer durables, Well, there is a very good example of a communist country that has, you know, embraced a consumer economy, and that's China. And the Chinese I mean, Deng Xiaoping supposedly said Something looked to the effect of he somebody his son asked him what he thought of Gorbachev, and he said, I think Gorbachev's a complete idiot. Yes. But this is communism with Chinese characteristics, Which basically means a kind of freedom to ignore aspects of communism that don't gel with with making money. But but Leninism absolutely did. I mean, Leninism was all about Kind of collectivization. But Tom, what about suppression of private enterprise? But I think most historians would say well, first of all, that's not what Gorbachev himself thinks. He thinks Lenin's new economic policy in the 19 Twenties after the Russian civil war did allow some space for limited private enterprise and that they can move towards a mixed economy. I think there one of the big problems with the Soviet Union is It's become so reliant on imports paid for with oil revenue, and it's completely failed to develop its own kind of consumer industries. So So it's like Saudi Arabia with snow, a bit. Is that what the Saudi what do they do? Do they spend their raw money on snow? No. But, I mean, it's The Saudi you know, notoriously, economies that have lots of oil tend to be dysfunctional. Well, yes, Iran is a good example from the seventies. We talked about Iran a lot in previous podcasts. And I think, yes, it's incredibly dysfunctional. I mean, it's unbelievably complicated economy. No one I mean, when Gorbachev is given, They're they're talking about this thing called the law of state enterprise, which is going to be this law that's gonna allow a little bit of more freedom for factories keep their money and to invest it and that sort of thing. Gorbachev says at one point, you know, I basically don't understand this, and and nobody really understands. Well, I I I feel sympathy. I mean, basically, he's trying to he's trying to amend a a machine for which there is no instruction manual. I think there's a there's a degree of that, but But I think he's also you see, the thing is he's trying to mend this machine, which has incredibly complicated kind of supply chain networks, and And it has this weird cashless system that enterprises use with each other, whereas citizens use cash and you can't change one to the other. I mean, it's completely mad, But that's the way it's a bit like any massive sclerotic institution. Once you start to fiddle with it, it becomes very difficult to stop it from falling apart. But the other thing is He combines this with a peer so he has the perestroika, which is restructuring, which kind of has political and economic developments. He combines it with glasnost, which has been opened, and that's in the wake of Chernobyl. So Chernobyl the explosion at Chernobyl is in April 1986. And after that, Gorbachev thinks, well, I need to I need to increase the speed. We need to have more newspapers. We need to have more discussion. And why is it why why does Chernobyl have that effect Because I think he's shocked by the incompetence, by the cover ups, by the ineptitude of the managers, by the way the atomic industry has been run, by their lies, all of that kind of stuff. You know, Gorbachev, Of course, he's complicit in covering it up a bit because he's the general secretary, and he kinda feels like he has to. But he still thinks, okay, we need to, You know, we just need to be more open, and we need to be more creative. Crucially, one of the things he does now one of the things we haven't talked about at all, which is very important for understanding Putin, It's the Soviet Union, and I know we have a lot of very, kind of, to to us, young listeners. The Soviet Union is not anything like a nation state, And it doesn't even really see itself as an empire. So it's got 15 republics, going all the way from Estonia I mean, it's a mad States in many ways has existed, you know, one form or another since the twenties, but it's got going all the way from Estonia to kind of Tajikistan. And the Russians are about roughly about 50% of that, you know, the Russian population. And There has always been the issue of nationalism. You know, there's always been tensions in the Caucasus in Central Asia and the Baltics and so on. And Gorbachev has this idea that by basically devolving a lot of power to the republics I mean, devolution, Tom, what could possibly go wrong? Devolving power to the republics, that will invigorate the system, you know, but at the same time, He wants to open everything up so people can debate things more freely. So that will obviously give nationalism more room to sort of to flourish. But he also, look, combines that with an attack on what he sees as the corruption of the old elites. So The old elites are embattled. People are talking about new ideas, but they're also being given more power. The the whole thing, it's a sort of He he creates unwittingly a kind of breeding ground for all these kind of nationalistic movements to thrive, and you see it as early as 1986. You see it in Kazakhstan and the Baltics and the Ukraine, movements calling for new language rights and, you know, opposing power stations and all these kinds of So the seeds of trouble are there even after he's only been there a year. And, Dominic, do we know what Putin is doing Yes. During this time? So this is Is it Saint Petersburg's deli? No. Now this is the interesting thing. He's not. So around about the point where, Chernenko gave way to Gorbachev, like Gorbachev came into power, Vladimir Putin has has been he's been working for the KGB since the late seventies, and he has now been posted to Dresden, East Germany. Of course, he has. Yes. Of Of course. So what he's doing, and he's doing sort of slightly it seems there are different stories. Some people say he's just compiling information about dissidents. Some people say, actually, he's trying to sort of Forge links with the sort of remnants of the Red Army faction, the Baader Meinhof gang in West Germany. We don't know because, of course, it's secret. But what we know is he's watching all this from outside. So he has left a state that he thinks is powerful, You know, strong, respected in the world, high status, and he sees this guy trying to reform it, to change things. And that's really important, I think, that Putin is watching it from outside, and he's watching it, frankly, with horror. And he's in East Germany, Yeah. It has a higher standard of living relative to the Soviet Union. It does indeed. Yes. So he is alert to, presumably, some of the problems that The Soviet economy faces. Yes. I I don't think you asked if Putin was a communist. He's certainly not a communist now and has not been since the fall of the USSR, but what he is is a believer in the Russian world in the Russian sphere of influence. And I think that's what's going to trouble him as we get into the late eighties and early nineties that that starts to fragments and 4 apart. Well, I think that's enough for today. So that's the end of today's episode. Please join us tomorrow to hear about when things really start imploding for Gorbachev In the late eighties and in due course for the Soviet Union itself. We will see you tomorrow. So that was the first of Four episodes in our miniseries on the Soviet Union, Russia, and Vladimir Putin. And in the next 3 episodes, we go from the fall of the USSR to Mikhail Gorbachev. We look at the economic nightmare and basket case that was Russia in the 19 nineties under Boris Yeltsin, and we tell the story of the rise of Vladimir Putin And the consolidation of his power since the turn of the millennium.

Now in this week's episode, you might remember I made reference to our sister podcast, The Rest is history. We've been discussing George Bush's famous quote about looking into Vladimir Putin's soul.\n\nWell, we thought we'd give you the chance to listen to the in full. It's the first of a 4 part series on Russia in the final days of the Soviet Union to today and Putin's violent kleptocracy. If you want to listen to the other episodes, the link is in the episode notes, or just search for the rest is history wherever You get your podcasts. Hope you enjoy it, and hope you come back to us. The rest is politics next Wednesday.\n\nAll the best.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hello. Welcome to The Rest is History, and, we would like to go over to Crawford, Texas where we are joined by a special guest.\n\nSpeaker 2: I I'll answer the question. I looked a man in the eye. I found it to be very straightforward and trustworthy, We had a very good dialogue. I was able to, get a sense of his soul. A man deeply committed to his country and his best interests of his country, and I appreciate it so very much, the frank dialogue.\n\nThere was no kind of diplomatic chitchat trying to throw each other off balance. There was a straightforward dialogue, And that's the beginning of a very constructive relationship. I wouldn't have invited him to my ranch if I didn't trust him.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was my brilliant impression of George w Bush. It wasn't actually. No. That was that really was George Bush.\n\nSpeaker 3: That was George that was our 1st presidential guest.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that was the occasion in 2001 of his first meeting with president Vladimir Putin. In light of the current situation, We thought that it would be interesting to look at some of the historical context. We've already done an episode on the history of Ukraine, but we thought that it would be, You know, I mean, essentially, everyone is asking, how did we get here? What is it that's prompted Putin to do what he's doing? You know, what what is the background?\n\nWhat what is there an explanation for it that can be discovered in in history, I suppose, and in his specifically, in his biography? This is a field that you are much, much more familiar with than I am. But I I guess I lived through it, so a lot of it.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. I think, Tom, there's that apocryphal saying by Napoleon, isn't there, that if you know the world if if you've studied the world when a man was 20, You know how his mind works. And, Vladimir Putin, like any Russian of his generation, he's born in 1952, Has lived through the most colossal, almost unimaginable political, economic kind of social changes in the former sov Soviet Union and and Russia. And And if we and it's only by understanding what's happened to him and his country, I think, that you can actually get get into his into his well, attempt to get into his head And to understand why Russia is now as it is. So now it's becoming you know, it appears to be becoming this pariah state, Kind of shuts off behind a new iron curtain of sanctions.\n\nHow on earth has it got here? And that's what we're going to try and try and Investigate.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, Dominic, you're of course, it it's been an absolutely convulsive period of change, but there is also always the historians, question change or continuity. And you could say I mean, people have been saying that actually not that much has changed, The Soviet Union was a a political system founded on lies, founded on A a profound suspicion of the outside, founded on an emphasis on military prowess over everything else. And you could say But Russia today is showing, you know, much the same\n\nSpeaker 3: is the air of that. Yeah. I don't that. Normally, I'm a great determinist in this podcast, but I don't think that's really true, actually. I think that misses you know, obviously, Putin himself is a product of the Soviet system, which we'll go into in a second.\n\nBut I think When you actually go through the period of change, you see that there were alternative paths that Russia could have taken, and and Russia isn't fated To be this sort of, right, violent, you know, a nationalistic kind of hellhole that that that so many people imagine. You know, what happened In the in the in the USSR in 19 eighties and then in Russia in 19 nineties, there were all kinds of contingencies and twists and and so on, And there were alternative futures for Russia, as we will see.\n\nSpeaker 1: But just before we go to look at, the last decade of the Soviet Union, You talked about the idea that that Russia wasn't fated to become what it is now. But that idea of fate, The idea that Russia has a particular destiny, I mean, that is something that is very strong in Russian culture and actually much older, of course, than communism.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. This sort of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. Well, I mean, there are 2 different things on there, Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. But the sort of the idea of Russia having this almost, As you would say, Tom, this almost kind of sacral destiny, you know, the the 3rd Rome, the home of Orthodoxy, kind of on the edge of Europe, Half in Europe, half out. I mean, that is very deeply rooted in Russia's sense of itself, the sense of embattlement, a sense a a distrust of The outside, but also a fascination with it.\n\nSo, yes, all those things are are are there, but there is a sort of slightly stereotypical way we talk about Russia. We always talk about I mean, even George Bush did it there when he talked about knowing Peter the soul. Yes. The idea of the Russians having a soul that you must understand that is incredibly deep and dark. I I mean, nobody says that about, you know,\n\nSpeaker 1: Belgium.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Belgium. No. Nobody says that about Belgium. Maybe Bart Van Leeu, our previous guest, I would say that's a\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, peep today, when you apply the word exceptionalism to countries, it's generally a a pejorative. So people are very sniffy about the idea that there might be British exceptionalism or French exceptionalism.\n\nSpeaker 3: Or Americans.\n\nSpeaker 1: Even though clearly, you know I mean, they are all very exceptional countries. But in Russia, it seems to be something that is pretty fundamental to the way that, not just Russian politicians, but large numbers of people within the country Think of Russia. Yes. Do you\n\nSpeaker 3: think that's fair or am\n\nSpeaker 1: I saying it might be?\n\nSpeaker 3: I think it no. I think it probably is fair. I think that's the way that a lot of Russians are are told to think about themselves, that they have an exceptional, a unique past and a kind of exceptional destiny. And that we do think of Russia typically as having an exceptional outsiders do, and that's all that stuff about the Russian soul and about, you know, Russians are terribly kind of warm people, but they're but they're also That the price of human life is lower and all that sort of thing that you hear so often. Yes.\n\nSo I think there is a kind of exceptionalism both projected from the outside but also believed Inside.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, it was expressed very unsettlingly by Putin, and I may be paraphrasing him here. And I you know, this may be, Disinformation. But didn't he say something to the effect talking with with regard to nuclear weapons? That, a a world Without Russia, wouldn't be a what you know, why should the why should the world exist if if it exists without Russia?\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. And not only has he said that, by the way, but His kind of mouthpieces on Russian state television have used exactly the same line. So that's, yeah, a World War nine, actually, in the sort of Putinist ideology.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Okay. So a bit unsettling Yeah. Coming from people with the largest quantity of nuclear weapons on the face of the planet. But, something that, as we said, can be traced back to the czarist Period.\n\nBut, obviously, gets a particular refinement under communism where what had been the Russian Empire becomes the Soviet Union. Yeah. And as the Soviet Union is one of 2 superpowers and sees itself charged with a historical destiny. It is the midwife of world communism. That has sustained it throughout decades of transformation and upheaval.\n\nBy the seventies, when Putin is coming of age, that sense of purpose and of destiny, perhaps, is starting to fade. It's The age of Brezhnev, a man with kind of insanely huge eyebrows\n\nSpeaker 3: And you do and a\n\nSpeaker 1: kind of rigor mortis starts, isn't it? I mean, they're all kinda basically dead. They are constantly getting colds, But keep them in their beds for 5 years. They wear nothing but overcoats.\n\nSpeaker 3: They wear things under the overcoats, Tom.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did they? I've never seen any evidence\n\nSpeaker 3: for that. Yeah. You're right. So that's what we're doing.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what's going on?\n\nSpeaker 3: So so Putin is born in Leningrad, Saint Petersburg in 1952, and he's from a working class family. His parents work in a factory, and he goes to Leningrad State University in 1970, I think, and he's there for 5 years. And so so he comes of age in the Brezhnev era, as you say, and it's an age of It's it is not an age of revolutionary zeal at all. So you mentioned communism and and and, a sort of sense of of communist zeal, but that really isn't What typifies the Brezhnev regime? The Brezhnev regime is all about stability, and there's a kind of ordinariness to it.\n\nSo for most people who are alive in the Soviet Union at that point, Soviet Union is all they've ever known, and everybody in the world, you know, in America, in Britain, in Western Europe, and in the The Soviet Union thinks the Soviet Union is going to probably be around forever. You know, it's, as you say, one of the 2 superpowers. It's sclerotic. The economy is producing enough to keep people happy, so they're fed. They've actually got more consumer goods than ever before.\n\nYou know, Robert Service in his history of Russia says, one I think he uses the phrase most Russian workers had never had it so good as they had it In the 19 seventies. They got fridges. They go on holiday there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, life's okay. But relatively relatively, they've never had it. I mean, they've never had it so good, Relative to the capitalist west?\n\nSpeaker 3: Of course, it's falling\n\nSpeaker 1: Economically, they're starting to fall behind.\n\nSpeaker 3: For for and The the prosperity the apparent prosperity of the seventies is based on a fiction. So it's based on a sclerotic, incredibly complicated top down, sort of system, you know, the the sort of parodies of sort of state planning and tractor statistics and all that stuff, they're all they're all rooted in truth. But it's also rooted in high oil prices. So high world that this they're almost living a bit of a a bit of an illusion because when the oil price falls in the 19 eighties, That's gonna pull the rug out from the from the system. And Brezhnev, as you say, I mean, he's not Stalin.\n\nYou know, he's nothing like Stalin. He's not. It's still a very autocratic system. It's one that represses distance and shoves them into psychiatric hospitals, but it doesn't kill lots of people. So life kind of, you know, goes on.\n\nAnd for a young man like Putin, his ambition is to join the KGB. Supposedly, he applies to join and they say to him, you don't apply. You know? We contact you. But they kinda make note of him because they know that he's loyal and hardworking and all this sort of stuff.\n\nSo for him, he thinks he's going to be he thinks he's joining the intelligence service of one of of of Of the actually, the world's great power because the 19 seventies is a terrible decade for the kind of the United States. It's the decade of Nixon and Carter and Vietnam and This sort of introspection. And the Soviet Union, there's a sort of sense that the Soviet Union might even be winning the Cold War. Burying them. Burying them as, yes, as Christophe said to said to Nixon.\n\nSo there's this sort of false false Image, I think, that people have about their own society in the seventies. And there are some people at the top of the Soviet regime. So in particular, the man who's going to succeed Brezhnev, who's a man called Yuri Andropov, who is the head of the KGB, there are some people who know that there are deep problems, that Russia has, Yeah. When I say Russia, the Soviet Union has huge problems with alcoholism, with absenteeism, that its birth rate is is struggling, that's, you know, high rates of corruption, all these kinds of things. But Putin doesn't see this as a young man, I wouldn't have said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, 2 questions. 1st of all, Putin, is he a committed communist as a young man, or is he a committed nationalist? What's the balance there?\n\nSpeaker 3: If you read sort of his semi official biography, it says that he reads you know, he enjoys reading Marxist Leninist books when he's at he's at school. I mean, I think It's a bit like Christianity, Tom.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it?\n\nSpeaker 3: You it is in this sense in this sense. There's a difference between being a Christian in the 2nd century AD And being a Christian in the 16th century when everybody's a Christian, and, you know, you're not a radical. You're not a rebel. You're not in Well,\n\nSpeaker 1: you might be in the 16th century.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. But you might not be you might not you might be a good Christian, but none of those things. You might just be an apparatchik, and, I think He's a communist in the sense that he's listened to everything he's been told, and that provides his framework. But I don't think he's a I don't think he burns with the zeal of social justice or or with Revolutionary enthusiasts. Alright.\n\nI don't actually, Tom, I don't think I think a lot of the people who are running the show don't burn with revolutionary zeal.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That was my other question. But, I think before I ask that, let's take a quick break.\n\nSpeaker 3: Welcome back to The Rest is History.\n\nSpeaker 1: You were just saying, before the break But, a lot of the people at the top of the Soviet Union are not burning with kind of revolutionary communist zeal. And The question I asked you was on Andropov. He's the guy who who notoriously has the cold. It lasts for, what, kind of 4 year, 3 years or something? I mean, he's in, I mean, basically, he's incapacitated for the whole period of his term of general\n\nSpeaker 3: secretary. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then he's succeeded by Chonenko, who is Kind of, in many ways, even more moribund. Are these are these guys people who, you know so Andropov is a very smart guy. He recognizes the Soviet Union has huge problems. Is he a believer, though? He he doesn't question the system.\n\nHe just thinks that the system needs a bit of tinkering. You know, apply the spanner here, a bit of oil there, and it will tick along fine.\n\nSpeaker 3: He doesn't question the mission, I suppose, is what I would say. So, yeah, I mean, Chvenenko, he's a hack. He's just a party hack. Andropov is is clever. He was the Soviet ambassador, I think, in, Hungary during the Budapest uprising.\n\nSo he he has taken from that a belief that you have to be you have to be strong. You know? You have to suppress dissent. You can't let things. But he also has taken a belief that, You have to get in ahead.\n\nSo, you know, you can't let yourself get in a situation where thousands of people are in the streets. You have to keep changing the system To make it work. So I don't think Andropov is in he's very severe. He's very strict. He's very anti corruption, and he's clever, And he has read forbidden books, and he as Soviets, sort of the the top brass, are allowed to do, they're expected to do, to inform themselves.\n\nAnd he surrounded himself with aids who are relatively free thinking, but he's still I mean, everybody there believes in them that their model must triumph, And they believe they're in a global competition with this with the United States. Absolutely.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And so he is you know, said he was head of the KGB. He's General secretary during the kind of the coldest days of the of the cold war in the early eighties. Yes. So he he is the guy who's in charge when Reagan is lambasting the Soviet Union as evil as ever.\n\nYeah. And it's 99 red balloons and 2 tribes Which is very frightening,\n\nSpeaker 3: by the way, for the Soviet leadership. They they think the Americans are going to attack them. I mean, we did a podcast about this with Taylor Downing, about nuclear war. They absolutely are terrified that the Americans are going to attack them first. But, yeah, Sondropov takes over.\n\nBrezhnev dies. I mean, Brezhnev basically died multiple times, and was literally brought back from the dead. You know, he's sort of resuscitated and dragged around as this sort of embalmed figure in the late 19 seventies. Andrew Pop succeeds in November 82 and is there till February 84. And as you said, He's basically ill the whole time.\n\nI mean, they're literally you know, the on one side of his bed, there'll be the man with the nuclear briefcase. The other side of his bed will be the nurses keeping him alive. Mhmm. And then he dies. Now the person he wants to succeed him is the crucial figure in this podcast, and for Putin, a figure of of utter ignominy And shame in Russian history as an a deed he is for a lot of Russians, and that man is Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nThat's the man that Andropov wants to take over, but he doesn't. He's too young. So the other people in the Politburo, they they bypass him, and they get this old hack, Charnenko, who is another sort of I mean, he's dying when he takes over, And he's there from February 84 to the spring of 85.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what was it about Gorbachev that Andropov had seen?\n\nSpeaker 3: That's a that's a That's a really good question. So Gorbachev is a generation younger. He's the youngest guy, I think, pretty much on the, Politburo. He joins in 1918. He's 49, which is incredibly young by the standards of the Soviet leadership.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he has glamorous wife.\n\nSpeaker 3: He does raise a very clever wife who's a very important I'm a hugely important figure for him, his chief adviser. I mean, his real, his real soulmate. So Gorbachev is from a place called Stavropol. He's from a little village called what's it called? Pribilnoir, I think it's called.\n\nAnd he's from Peasant Stock. He's bright. He's He's super bright. He's gone to Moscow State University, and I think he's read law.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's got a birthmark on his, forehead.\n\nSpeaker 3: He doesn't need He's traveled, so he's been abroad. He even went on a 3 week driving holiday in France with RASA, and they sort of drove around France\n\nSpeaker 1: and they\n\nSpeaker 3: said and said, God, you know, this place is so much better than the Soviet Union. You know, this is the sort of classic thing that often happens when people are posted to the West. He actually one of his chief aids one of his chief advisers is a man called Alexander Yakovlev, who'd been ambassador to Canada and and basically had exactly the same kind of Crisis of confidence. You know, you got to Canada, and they're like, oh my god. This place is great.\n\nSpeaker 1: But when Gorbachev becomes general secretary. Yeah. He he's still a believer. I mean, he just because he's he's got nice camembert in France, it doesn't mean that he says Tom.\n\nSpeaker 3: Absolutely. He's a believer. He is He is idealistic, and this is one of the great problems with Gorbachev. Now Gorbachev is a fascinating character because, of course, everybody listening to this, by and large, will think, oh, Gorby, nice guy, You know, Nobel Peace Prize winner, top man. Of course, in Russia, he is regarded with absolute contempt.\n\nAnd I have to say, when you when you start to dig into the story and you think about Gorbachev in a in a slightly more detached way, I mean, we've done a lot of weak and failed leaders on this podcast. Although it pains me to say it because he's an admirable man in so many ways. I mean but when he leaves office, he's only in there for 6 years. And when he leaves, His his country has completely and utterly fallen apart. Now some people would say that's because the problems are too great, but I think Gorbachev, I think almost all historians actually who really work on this, people like, Robert Service or Vladislav Zubok, who writes a brilliant book called Collapse, that came out last year at the Ford of the Soviet Union.\n\nThey would just say Gorbachev is a complete and utter disaster. Why? He's idealistic, Tom. He's he's bright. He and Raisa have have spent loads of time talking about the future of the Soviet Union.\n\nThey like talking to other kind of intellectually kind of people. Gorbachev is also very canny, so he's been able to get up the kind of greasy pole. He's powerful patrons like Andropov, think a lot of him. He says to Raisin when he rejoins the I think it's when he joined the politburo, he said, we can't live like this any longer, and he's determined to fix the system. But he goes about fixing it in such a politically incompetent I mean, again, it slightly pains me to say it, but he he fixes it in such an inept way that absolutely everything gets worse.\n\nHe does too much, too quickly, too many different areas, and and everything falls apart. And you said, was he a believer? He's absolutely a believer. So, Vladislav Zubat brings this out really well in his book. He says, you know, Gorbachev is obsessed with Lenin.\n\nI mean, this is so much like that. You're parallel with your Christianity stuff about people who, you know, people who would kind of Oliver Cromwell or somebody reading the bible to guide them. Gorbachev has Lenin's sort of works on his desk, and he will sort of dip into them in the way that people sometimes dip into the bible. He will dip into them to try and get inspiration for what he needs to do. And he becomes convinced he is convinced that The Soviet Union has taken a wrong turn since the 19 twenties, and it needs to get back to Lenin's vision.\n\nHe idealizes Lenin, and he thinks Lenin had a vision It's a more democratic, free, open, creative. And if I can get back to that, we'll establish true communism and and then We'll turn this sort of sinking ship around if you can turn the sinking ship around.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that's that's quite a kind of abstract sense of mission. But I maybe I've got this wrong, But I thought that he was also focused on a very specific problem, which was that, the Soviet economy was massively distorted by defense spending. So Yeah. They they're spending, what, 20, 25%? No.\n\nSpeaker 3: It's probably not that's actually been exaggerated. It's about 15%, I think, is the\n\nSpeaker 1: latest estimate. Quite a lot. It is, but it's If he's going to if they're going to, you know, guns to butter Yeah. Then they need to make things up with the West. So he does that very effectively.\n\nI mean, he's very good at that. Yes. He he he definitely kinda removes the chill from the cold war very effectively, so which is why people in the west, You know, rate him so highly. But as someone who is ideologically committed to Marxist Leninism, I I mean, isn't it a definition of the job that kind of trying to construct an economy that will provide Soviet citizens with all the kind of consumer durables and gizmos that you get in the west is bound to fail. I mean, it's there's just no way it can be done.\n\nSpeaker 3: No. I don't agree with that. I don't actually don't agree with either of those things. So first of all, the defense spending, that has become a very comforting myth that the West tells itself about the Soviet Union Particularly in America, that we crippled we won the Cold War by increasing defense spending so much that they couldn't keep up. But most historians, I think, would now say they could keep up.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, they had With defense spending.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. They've done it since the forties. They could they could have carried on doing it. I mean, That defense spending is not what brings the Soviet Union down. 2nd point, I forgot what your second point was, Tom.\n\nAs consumer durables, Well, there is a very good example of a communist country that has, you know, embraced a consumer economy, and that's China. And the Chinese I mean, Deng Xiaoping supposedly said Something looked to the effect of he somebody his son asked him what he thought of Gorbachev, and he said, I think Gorbachev's a complete idiot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. But this is communism with Chinese characteristics, Which basically means a kind of freedom to ignore aspects of communism that don't gel with with making money. But but Leninism absolutely did. I mean, Leninism was all about Kind of collectivization. But Tom, what about suppression of private enterprise?\n\nSpeaker 3: But I think most historians would say well, first of all, that's not what Gorbachev himself thinks. He thinks Lenin's new economic policy in the 19 Twenties after the Russian civil war did allow some space for limited private enterprise and that they can move towards a mixed economy. I think there one of the big problems with the Soviet Union is It's become so reliant on imports paid for with oil revenue, and it's completely failed to develop its own kind of consumer industries.\n\nSpeaker 1: So So it's like Saudi Arabia with snow, a bit.\n\nSpeaker 3: Is that what the Saudi what do they do? Do they spend their raw money on snow?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. But, I mean, it's The Saudi you know, notoriously, economies that have lots of oil tend to be dysfunctional. Well, yes, Iran is\n\nSpeaker 3: a good example from the seventies. We talked about Iran a lot in previous podcasts. And I think, yes, it's incredibly dysfunctional. I mean, it's unbelievably complicated economy. No one I mean, when Gorbachev is given, They're they're talking about this thing called the law of state enterprise, which is going to be this law that's gonna allow a little bit of more freedom for factories keep their money and to invest it and that sort of thing.\n\nGorbachev says at one point, you know, I basically don't understand this, and and\n\nSpeaker 1: nobody really understands. Well, I I I feel sympathy. I mean, basically, he's trying to he's trying to amend a a machine for which there is no instruction manual.\n\nSpeaker 3: I think there's a there's a degree of that,\n\nSpeaker 0: but\n\nSpeaker 3: But I think he's also you see, the thing is he's trying to mend this machine, which has incredibly complicated kind of supply chain networks, and And it has this weird cashless system that enterprises use with each other, whereas citizens use cash and you can't change one to the other. I mean, it's completely mad, But that's the way it's a bit like any massive sclerotic institution. Once you start to fiddle with it, it becomes very difficult to stop it from falling apart. But the other thing is He combines this with a peer so he has the perestroika, which is restructuring, which kind of has political and economic developments. He combines it with glasnost, which has been opened, and that's in the wake of Chernobyl.\n\nSo Chernobyl the explosion at Chernobyl is in April 1986. And after that, Gorbachev thinks, well, I need to I need to increase the speed. We need to have more newspapers. We need to have more discussion.\n\nSpeaker 1: And why is it why why does Chernobyl have that effect\n\nSpeaker 3: Because I think he's shocked by the incompetence, by the cover ups, by the ineptitude of the managers, by the way the atomic industry has been run, by their lies, all of that kind of stuff. You know, Gorbachev, Of course, he's complicit in covering it up a bit because he's the general secretary, and he kinda feels like he has to. But he still thinks, okay, we need to, You know, we just need to be more open, and we need to be more creative. Crucially, one of the things he does now one of the things we haven't talked about at all, which is very important for understanding Putin, It's the Soviet Union, and I know we have a lot of very, kind of, to to us, young listeners. The Soviet Union is not anything like a nation state, And it doesn't even really see itself as an empire.\n\nSo it's got 15 republics, going all the way from Estonia I mean, it's a mad States in many ways has existed, you know, one form or another since the twenties, but it's got going all the way from Estonia to kind of Tajikistan. And the Russians are about roughly about 50% of that, you know, the Russian population. And There has always been the issue of nationalism. You know, there's always been tensions in the Caucasus in Central Asia and the Baltics and so on. And Gorbachev has this idea that by basically devolving a lot of power to the republics I mean, devolution, Tom, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nDevolving power to the republics, that will invigorate the system, you know, but at the same time, He wants to open everything up so people can debate things more freely. So that will obviously give nationalism more room to sort of to flourish. But he also, look, combines that with an attack on what he sees as the corruption of the old elites. So The old elites are embattled. People are talking about new ideas, but they're also being given more power.\n\nThe the whole thing, it's a sort of He he creates unwittingly a kind of breeding ground for all these kind of nationalistic movements to thrive, and you see it as early as 1986. You see it in Kazakhstan and the Baltics and the Ukraine, movements calling for new language rights and, you know, opposing power stations and all these kinds of So the seeds of trouble are there even after he's only been there\n\nSpeaker 1: a year. And, Dominic, do we know what Putin is doing Yes. During this time? So this is Is it Saint Petersburg's deli?\n\nSpeaker 0: No.\n\nSpeaker 3: Now this is the interesting thing. He's not. So around about the point where, Chernenko gave way to Gorbachev, like Gorbachev came into power, Vladimir Putin has has been he's been working for the KGB since the late seventies, and he has now been posted to Dresden, East Germany.\n\nSpeaker 1: Of course, he has. Yes. Of Of course.\n\nSpeaker 3: So what he's doing, and he's doing sort of slightly it seems there are different stories. Some people say he's just compiling information about dissidents. Some people say, actually, he's trying to sort of Forge links with the sort of remnants of the Red Army faction, the Baader Meinhof gang in West Germany. We don't know because, of course, it's secret. But what we know is he's watching all this from outside.\n\nSo he has left a state that he thinks is powerful, You know, strong, respected in the world, high status, and he sees this guy trying to reform it, to change things. And that's really important, I think, that Putin is watching it from outside, and he's watching it, frankly, with horror.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he's in East Germany, Yeah. It has a higher standard of living relative to the Soviet Union. It\n\nSpeaker 3: does indeed. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So he is alert to, presumably, some of the problems that The Soviet economy faces.\n\nSpeaker 3: Yes. I I don't think you asked if Putin was a communist. He's certainly not a communist now and has not been since the fall of the USSR, but what he is is a believer in the Russian world in the Russian sphere of influence. And I think that's what's going to trouble him as we get into the late eighties and early nineties that that starts to fragments and 4 apart.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think that's enough for today. So that's the end of today's episode. Please join us tomorrow to hear about when things really start imploding for Gorbachev In the late eighties and in due course for the Soviet Union itself. We will see you tomorrow.\n\nSpeaker 3: So that was the first of Four episodes in our miniseries on the Soviet Union, Russia, and Vladimir Putin. And in the next 3 episodes, we go from the fall of the USSR to Mikhail Gorbachev. We look at the economic nightmare and basket case that was Russia in the 19 nineties under Boris Yeltsin, and we tell the story of the rise of Vladimir Putin And the consolidation of his power since the turn of the millennium.
