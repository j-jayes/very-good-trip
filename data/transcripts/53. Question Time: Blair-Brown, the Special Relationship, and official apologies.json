That is also where you can find how to buy the remaining tickets for our live show in Blackpool on October 8th, although the posh sheets have all now sold out. Now, Rory, I said, on the main podcast, I wanted to kick off with education, which is quite interesting how many questions there were this week. Richard Westcott, why is there so little focus on education in the political debate? People obsess about the health service, but there's next to nothing on funding for state schools, which are struggling. Martin Brader, you'll like this one. We've had 9 secretaries of state for education in 12 years. How can that be considered a priority? How long do you need in a job to get on top of the get on top of things and make a difference? Dord says schools asking parents for money To fund basics, is this not incremental privatization? And, Tim Roche, I'd like to know your thoughts on lifting a grammar school moratorium. Will it increase inequality? Well, I can answer that one very, very briefly. Yes. It would. So, Rory, what do you think? It's true, isn't it? We don't hear you know, when when When I was working with Tony Blair, priority education, education, education, I think we did focus on that, but it doesn't really get into the debate in a way that it used to. It's difficult, isn't it? Very difficult, very tough. And I don't don't know what's going on there because everybody gets that, fundamentally, if we're ready to transform our economy, get our growth going, We need much, much higher quality education, and Britain is, very sadly, behind In a loss of the international metrics and league tables, even on very basic stuff like like literacy and maths, and That's not good. And we you know, all the drives of various governments to get STEM subjects off the ground haven't paid off as much as people had hoped. We're not getting as many people into Science, technology, engineering, maths as we'd hoped, compared to, you know, we were talking on this in the podcast, the incredible figures that are being achieved in China in terms of Engineering graduates. So, no, we've got to talk about it more. But maybe it's just another example of something that people struggle to get stories out of because A lot of it is so detailed. It's to do with everything from how you fund teachers' pensions to how you deal with Students with special needs, how you deal with school exclusions, how you deal with curriculum, how you deal with decaying school buildings, and maybe this stuff is just difficult to communicate. I think the other thing sorry to get onto one of my regular hobby horses, but, you know, 7% of the country use private education. But if you get the figure for, for example, the cabinet, which is one of the most privately educated we've ever had, If you get the figure for seed leading editors and commentators, many of them use private schools for their own children. And I think that the state system, is not treated with the respect that it needs within the national debate. I think that is one of the reasons that Those who control the terms of national debate, too many of them, either have their own experience in private education or experience with their children. And, certainly, large parts of the media, in my view, cover state schools either not at all or as a basket case, when, actually, If we all came together, and this is this is the lesson from Canada and from Finland and from those countries that are always right up near the top of the p's and e tables is that where there is a societal commitment to state education, then the state education is a lot stronger. Yeah. And I think I'm sure you're right that people report well thoughtfully about things they understand. And if All these dominant voices in the media and politics are privately educated that simply don't understand what they're talking about. Really cheeky question here, but I thought it was I thought it was I was cheeky, but but it it was it was maybe worth worth having a go at you on. So Rupert Carlton Jones, I've just listened to Alastair's interview with Stephen Mangan On his Confessions Show, where Alastair confessed to never having done anything practical in his life, including never having cooked a meal. 1, was Rory aware of this? 2, is Fiona an actual saint? 3, if he tells us he has never changed to nappy, I think I may have to stop Listening. Well, Rory, I told you last week, we were getting comments from people that they felt that Question Time Was not as serious as the main podcast, and most of our listeners, I think, wanted to stay serious. Yeah. Tell me Tell me this is you've become a politician you're trying to avoid. Tell me this is serious. Tell me. I'm happy to answer it. This is terrific. I'm happy to answer it. Want to hear something else. That's exactly channels. Those Tory politicians here. I don't think they want them. I think the listeners want to know what lies wants to hear about is my views on what's happening in Azerbaijan. That's right. Look. It's true that I it's not strictly true that I've never cooked a meal. I've cooked 1 meal in my life. It was a tuna and potato souffle. Oh my goodness. In the it was in the early days of my and Fiona's courtship 42, 43 years ago. And and and we can we can conclude we can conclude it did not Very well. If that's okay. It was okay, although she did have to help me. I I am not proud of my lack of practicality. I'm not proud of the fact that I don't know how to change a plug. I don't know how to change a tire. I'm not proud of it, but it's just I'm I think I'm good at some things, and I'm not good at other things. Is Fiona a saint? I think probably. Yeah. I think she's pretty close. And what was the 3rd part of this? It it so he said if he tells us he's never changed a nappy Oh, I changed loads of nappies. Okay. I changed loads of nappies. I think that I think Fiona would say that even though I had a very, very, very, very busy job for much of their childhood, I was very good at being a dad, But I was probably only good at the things that she I didn't do things like you know, I like taking them out. I like playing with them. I like going on and playing football with the boys. But, No. I'm not proud of it, Rory. I'm very, very impractical. But shall we move on to something a bit less? John here. Can I give some more suggestions? Sorry about that. Yeah. Let's go for Let's go for Biden trust. Paul Harrison, I get the sense that the Biden administration is fed up with the UK. How is the special relationship holding up? Ruth Wilkinson, is the Biden snub to trust, this was Biden not seeing trust in the margins of the funeral, significant? Is this about him signalling his priority for Northern Ireland, and is that relevant to the trade deal? And Jeremy Huer, how important do you think Biden's Irish heritage is in relation to his dealings with the UK. So I do think it's, you know, I I think it would have been pretty extraordinary If it had been any previous prime minister, if there'd been a president in town and there was no meeting, I think that was pretty I do think that was pretty big. Really a bit odd. And she could have got to the airport Seen and done almost anything. It's very, very strange. I I do think that it's certainly true that Biden began his presidency with a lot of reservations about Britain. And, I remember when we were dealing with him over Iraq, we're now going back to 2005, 2006, a friend of mine went into a meeting with then vice president Biden And tried to explain the situation between Sunni and Shia. And he said, I get it. I get it. They don't like each other. It's like me and the Brits. I'm Irish. So That that there is definitely a background there of him making jokes about not liking British people. Is that being public? Is that is that is that a known fact? Don't know don't know whether people have been talking much about that, but definitely he's I've heard him I've heard him make similar comments about his mother Right. But not about himself. Not about himself. Yeah. So but I think since he's come in, he's been, practical. And like many American presidents, he understands special relationship matters a lot to Britain. It's worth bearing in mind the special relationship point that somebody tried to track how many times the United States uses variants on special relationship, and they use it for Something like 9 or 10 different countries. Obviously, they, you know, they would do it in a particular way in relation to Israel. They'd do it in a particular way in relation to to, you know, many, many other places their partner with Canada, etcetera. But I think he's okay in his relationship to Britain. I definitely don't think he's gonna put up with something that might lead to The breaking of the Northern Ireland protocol there. But that's what he fears is on the cards, and that's possibly why he has been indicating. And we've said before, I I think at some point, I really do hope he comes up and says in black and white why it would be so dangerous to the so called special relationship. I my sense of the Americans on a special relationship is that they they only say it in reference to Britain when when the British media around. I don't think they kind of feel it in the way that we maybe feel it. Here's a good question, Tim Bell. He's a very smart professor, teaches at London, Does a lot on Twitter worth following people who are political geeks, but he just asked us. The government has basically written a huge blank check worth at least a £100,000,000,000. If you ran the country and could write such a big blank check, what single thing would you spend the money on? I guess he's talking about the fact that the choice was to spend a 150,000,000,000 probably On capping energy prices, is that what you would have done, or would you have done something else for the money? Oh my god. A 150,000,000,000. I mean, you can do a lot with a 150,000,000,000. You have to bear in mind, though, it's being borrowed. Yep. So it's not as it were. It's not that you've got a 150,000,000,000 in the bank. How do you spend it? It's a huge amount. Right? Sort of it's probably about 20% of government expenditure in a normal year. I'll tell you I'll tell you what. This probably sounds a bit crazy Yep. Given that one of my sort of Actions in life is the the utter revolution of an in our approach to mental health understanding and services. My god. If you had a £150,000,000,000 to invest in the mental health of the nation, we would be able to fix an awful lot of things. I'd I'd spend it on adult social care. So it the the real shame that I always felt as an MP, and it hasn't been dealt with at all, is the poor elderly Currently get about 15 minutes of care a day. It's not enough really to wash them, let alone feed them. And it's the great unfinished revolution. The NHS never really extended to care for the frail elderly. We should be using it to provide free care to the frail elderly. Good. Here's a good one. Rob Lenzi. Just watched Jacinda Ardern on the BBC. Listen to Mark Drakeford on the rest of his politics. They both communicate so much more clearly than the leaders we see in Westminster. Why do you think that is? I did think about Mark Drakeford last week. I I listened back to it a couple of times. I I I really like the fact that he just answered the questions. Yeah. He he sort of does, doesn't he? I mean, he he He sometimes answers the missing out bits. I mean, he's still a politician. Right? I mean, it's not No. Rory, I think you're being very harsh on him. I I think you're finding it very difficult. Fiona I'm gonna pass on a point that Fiona made. She came back from walking the dog, having listened to the podcast, and she said, Rory doesn't like admitting that Labour politicians are very effective. I don't like committing any politicians are very effective, I think, if you were honest. I think she I think Fiona needs to needs to No. I I don't know. I think you'd be I think you'd be unfair. I think he answered the questions very, very clearly, and I think he answered them In a way that I I I had a lot of reactions like that. We had a lot of reactions, to the to the podcast on from people saying they found it really refreshing that he he basically listened to the question, then he answered it, and then he started a a debate around it. So So you don't agree with the premise? I don't quite agree. I found I found I mean, I had stiffer one. We we should come back to this. I still found him a little bit on the boring side, but maybe this isn't isn't the time to be having this discussion. Okay. Now, there was a good question I thought, which was, which goes to the heart of stuff that you know and that people are very interested in. So, Seb Elson, Watching the funeral queen Elizabeth, noticed Jordan Brown, Shri Blair talking while seated next to each other. What's the relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown now? He goes on to say, would you say they're friends? He finds the dynamic between XPMs fascinating, particularly when you see Johnson May, Cameron Brown, Blair and Major altogether. Are they friends? Are they close friends? Or is that not the right way of putting it? I think I think they were there was a time in their Relationship in opposition when they were very, very, very close friends, politically and personally. I think that the strains and stresses of government Meant that due there were periods during our time in in office when it well, this is no secret. You know? There are 8 volumes of it, when things became quite strained. But I'd say they are. I think that their relationship is is a lot better. I think there's a I think there's a A real mutual respect, that they both have. But equally, they've gone on to do they're both still very active and very You've been very involved, but they, you know, they they don't, as it were, do stuff together in the way that for most of their their careers, they did. I've I've found that that we talked in on the main podcast about how interesting it was with all the body all the the sort of People watching that you could do at the funeral. I did find that, you know, because we've had so many prime ministers in these last 12 years of conservative failure, Rory, austerity, Brexit, conservatives devaluation disaster. We now have more former prime ministers than we've ever had in our history. One of my favorite moments of the entire funeral service was when the archbishop of Canterbury, he he was definitely looking at Boris Johnson when he said the line about people who really serve will be remembered long after those who sought to cling on to power and privilege. I I thought that was a that was a very, very, very good line. It's also a good line from an archbishop. I guess it's something we really wanna. Was that the main sermon, wasn't it? I thought it was really good. It was it was short. It was punchy. It's also for for kinda historical geeks. It's amazing the role of, clergymen giving speeches in these royal contexts. A lot of what was going on In Shakespeare's plays is responding to the other great dramatic moments in Elizabeth and early Jack B in England, which were about Priests challenging the queen and the king in their Sunday sermons, and this went all the way back to Henry the 8th. The queens and kings had to sit there and listen to sometimes quite radical preachers who pop up on a Sunday, An hour and a half, 2 hours seminar lecturing them on the sins of the kings and all this kind of thing. John Knox, of course, is a great one at doing this to to James first of Scotland. I I thought what I liked about the archbishop's, contribution, I I thought there was a there was a personality to it. I didn't think the readings were very good. I wasn't that moved by the hymns, and I I do like a I do like a nice hymn. You didn't you didn't like the lord's my shepherd. That's alright. Oh, yeah. That was fine. That was fine. But that's Kind of, you know, that that is but but I just felt the the readings could have maybe been a had a bit more personal and personality in them. And here we are back again with the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Andrew Kitching wants to know I don't know if you've been to state funerals, Rory. What's your most memorable state funeral from your days in government. Mine actually is very, very close to where you're sitting right now. It was king Hussein. There was a very sad point of your of your mother's death. Was that the same event you had witnessed in the No. No. No. My I would no. No. No. It wasn't. I was I was that was separate. I was in Jordan when my mother died. But, no, the King Hussein's funeral, which which was What what what do you remember about it? I just remember the elements of chaos. I remember when we were reading about the build up to The queen's funeral, and there was the whole thing about the the the leaders would have to go on a bus. And Biden's people say there's no way he's gonna get a bus, And then the other leaders say, well, why do cannot why do I have to go to bus if he's not on a bus? And all that stuff. And there was there was everyone was taken to this kind of Vast I I I in my diary, I call it a holding palace. Every sort of bundled into this palace. And so what you had was these Literally hundreds of of dignitaries from different parts of the world bumping into each other. Remember, Chirac and Clinton having what they Clinton was joking. It was one of the sort of, you know, one of the best bilaterals he'd ever had, and it was literally on a staircase, while across the way, There was another bilateral going on between, you know, the the Israeli and the Jordanian, and then down the stairs, Tony Blair had bumped into the German chancellor. And they were just It was the it was like this kind of and, of course, people were being respectful, but there were no cameras in there. So it was literally it was like a political bazaar. People were thinking, right. I can get. I remember on the walk down, they would then have to walk down to the to the burial. And it was like you could See the leaders who were desperately trying to get in the shot behind Clinton. There's all this Right. Right. Right. Right. Going on. And people who were Just wanting to I remember Clinton turning to Sherrack at one point and saying, hey, Jack. How many bilaterals? You know, I done 30 down the staircase. I did 12 in that little room with the coffee. And it was just it was just chaos. It was but it was something wonderful about it. No. Now we we had a we had a question from somebody About apologies. Lewis Thomas asked, could you please give some insight on why there are many historic wrongs the governments acknowledge but don't apologize for? An example being the Amritsar massacre. And so that's an interesting one. So I think the queen laid a wreath at Amritsar. Amritsar was where General Dyer opened fire on a crowd in Amritsar. It's a very, very big scene in the film Gandhi that people will will remember. Queen Lady wreath in 97. David Cameron said it was deeply shameful in 2013. 2019, Theresa May said, we deeply regret what happened and the suffering and calls. She called it a shameful scar in British Indian history, but she didn't apologize. What's going on that they say all these things, but they just somehow Full sort of apologizing. I don't know in relation to that one. You probably know more about it than I do. I there is something strange about the extent to which Politicians and governments don't like to apologize, and yet some of the most powerful moments come from apology. Was it Kevin Rudd who was prime minister Australia when he apologized for the treatment of the indigenous population? Right. I people often say that one of David Cameron's finest moments was his response to the bloody Sunday inquiry. And I guess what that says is that sometimes it's easier to for things that have happened that were not, as it were, directly your fault, your responsibility. And and that's definitely true with the Emirates Massacre. I mean, why why wouldn't you do it? I mean, if you're gonna say it's deeply shameful, it's an indelible scar on Britain's reputation, I mean, you basically have apologized. So why not just say, And we profoundly apologize. I don't know is the answer on that. I don't know why you wouldn't do that. I imagine at the time, there would have been Political pressures possibly from other parts of Indian politics, other parts of the region's politics. I just don't know. Or or what maybe people are saying with when it comes to British empire that it's not quite clear where you'd ever stop. And, you know, are you gonna be how Far back, are you gonna go with your apologies? Are you gonna apologize for what happened 300 years ago, 400 years ago, etcetera? Well, I I saw I saw in the in the The build up of The Queen's Funeral, the interview with a member of the Greek establishment and was onto the theme of the Elgin Marbles. And, I've often wondered about that, whether it's because it's it's a kind of where do you draw the line? Once you've conceded a principle, about where something rightfully belongs. What then is the next one? I don't know, but it's a I I I think there is because in that we know in our own lives But, actually, apology often can be very healing and very strengthening. I actually think that the public are far more Tolerant to people apologizing, although you might you may remember Nick Clegg where he apologized for tuition fees. I mean, that do you remember? And he's The he he he was immediately sort of lampooned by some of the best memes that were ever made. One one of the questions on your that education question that you read right at the beginning of this episode commented on ministers turning over so quickly. And Yeah. Clearly, that is very, very, very fundamental to our entire problems in governance. I mean, we talked about that. We've had, you know, 6 France actually is in whatever it is, 8 years compared to 6 24 years. But 9 education sectors in 12 years, that's pretty extraordinary, isn't it? Absolutely unbelievable. But if you, You know, in my my ministerial career, I was in my 1st job for just under 12 months as environment minister. I was then Middle East, Asian minister for, I think, Another 12 months, African minister for probably 7 months, prisons minister for 14 months. I mean, it's completely mad. And so we've got this odd situation where on the one hand, we pretend that ministers run things. So we've got a sort of slightly headless chicken situation where our entire constitution It's based on this idea that civil servants advise ministers decide. And if there aren't strong ministers in place, often there's real inertia, and it's very difficult for stuff to get done. But on the other hand, the civil service are very, very aware that the ministers are going to be swapped over every year or at most every 2 years. And so if a minister comes in with very Strong views wants to do something. They will be very aware that their successor may well not want to do that, and there's no point going down that path. I mean, I felt this again and again. I would try to ThinkAI was being bold, doing something really big on and then doubling different spend on environment and climate change, and I couldn't understand the resistance. But now I realize that, of course, they're thinking, Well, if we go right over the top and make a 2,000,000,000 commitment for this guy, the next woman or man coming in is is likely to traverse it. So why would we do it? We've had all those jobs, Roy. I'm about to give you another job, Hobbit king. If you could work, asking us both, if you could work for any prime minister in history, who would it be and why? For for me, I would definitely work for William Gladstone. What would your job be? Blimey. I'd do anything from my carrier's bag. I'd be his chief of Staff, I I I don't understand. What I love about him is the sense that he got so much more radical as he got older. I love people who start as It's kind of rigid conservatives as he did. He started as the defender of the slave trade and finished as one of our most liberal prime ministers ever trying to Solve the problems in Ireland. In fact, if he'd got his home rule bill through, he may well have been able to save such untold misery. And and the older he got, the more radical he got. And I I there's there's a lovely interview which I'm completely obsessed with with Samuel Beckett towards the end of his life where A French interviewer is asking him, does you know, he's in his eighties. Do you miss your youth? And Beckett says, not with the fire that's in me now. That's interesting because I was utterly obsessed by Samuel Beckett when I was at university, including making pilgrimages to Paris to try and track him down in cafes. Did you find him? No. I found him once, and it was very done. And very unsatisfying. I think I'd go for Atlee. Uh-huh. What would you do for him? I just would have liked to have observed him because he's I I do think he's one of those prime ministers that Genuinely changed the country for the better. And, obviously, that era was very, very special in our history. I was probably I probably would've I'd like to I think that would have been quite an interesting job. You definitely would have been a bit more oomph. His speeches were phenomenally boring, so could have could have done with you. Although Adly had these Incredibly dominating charismatic figures in his cabinet, Bevan Bevan and others. I mean, I I and that's slightly what I worry Labour's lacking at the moment. I'm we're lacking these Huge big beast that that was the secret for these team of rivals. Here's a question not for today, but to put us on our metal For us to answer next week Mhmm. Because I don't think we can do it. We'll humiliate ourselves if we try now. But Fabiana Lopez da Silvera, I'm an enthusiastic yet slightly frustrated Brazilian listener of your podcast. As you constantly namedrop Bolsonaro as a token example of the rise of Mainly right wing populism across the globe, but never actually talk about him or Brazil in general. So here is my challenge. The both of you spend at least 5 straight minutes commenting on Brazilian politics, including former president Lula, Who's leading all the polls even though Bolsonaro insists that it's all a lie? Well, actually, Roy, I would be very happy to spend 5 minutes talking about that right now, but, however, I have to be in the dentist chair in a few minutes. So but I'm happy I'm happy. I think she I think Fabian is right. I think we given that Brazil is such an enormous country, given the Bolsonaro is such a controversial figure, and Lula is a very controversial figure too. We probably have been a little bit remiss in not talking more about the Brazilian election. So, yeah, let's do that let's do that next week. I really think that thing about the dentist is a bit cheeky. I don't think most of our listeners believe that you can do 5 minutes nonstop on Brazilian politics. I well, I can, and I will do with the dentist today. And I will if you like, I will film myself I will film myself in the dentist chair. Share. No. Go on. Do it next to the do it. I believe you do it Brazil. Let's why why don't why don't we close on on something a little bit lighter? It's perfectly obvious to me from responses just walking around the place and on social media that, Peter Morgan's film, The Queen, was obviously played at some point on television in recent days, because there were quite a lot of questions of it about it. Sam Galloway asks me how frustrating was it to be portrayed as a caricature in queen. Ed, did you like your portrayal in The Thick of It? Rory, who would you like to play you if a film was made of your life? And lots of questions just asking, what did I think of the movie The Queen, and what do I think of the New Labour portrayals and the actors who have played me? So let's do you first. Who would you like to? I know you said Danny DeVito the last time we were asked this, but what's a serious answer? Who would you like to play it? Yeah. Just play me. It has to be one of those posh boy actors, wouldn't it? Damon Lewis, Benedict Cumberbatch, one of the Italian Hirovians. Well, I'm a huge, huge fan of Eddie Redmayne. And in certain lights Yeah. He looks like you. Much better looking version myself. So maybe that maybe that would be the way to go. Have you seen Private Eye this week? No. I didn't see Private Eye this week. You are in Private Eye. Please don't get scared. You are in prime eye as the you know, the thing where they do, are they, by any chance, related? And it's you And Abraham Lincoln. And the caption says, don't let anybody be fooled by Lincoln's beard. And you do have that Eddie Redmayne sort of lined face look, both of you. So let's go with Eddie Redmayne, playing Rory Stewart, Abraham Lincoln. Cool. And what's what's your answer to those questions here? I saw The Queen was an extraordinary film because it didn't portray the Queen or Tony Blair as caricatures, ticket tours, but it did play it did portray the other characters, me, Duke of Edinburgh, Cheri Blair. I think we were caricatured, but that maybe that's just because they don't have, you You know, the the central story was the relationship between the queen and the prime minister, and I thought they were very well portrayed. I I've been played by quite a lot of actors in quite a lot of different films.

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nHello, and welcome to the rest of politics question time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: Many thanks to those of you who've signed up to the rest is politics plus and are enjoying the early release Of these question time episodes, if you want to sign up and haven't already, just go to the rest is politics.com. That is also where you can find how to buy the remaining tickets for our live show in Blackpool on October 8th, although the posh sheets have all now sold out. Now, Rory, I said, on the main podcast, I wanted to kick off with education, which is quite interesting how many questions there were this week. Richard Westcott, why is there so little focus on education in the political debate? People obsess about the health service, but there's next to nothing on funding for state schools, which are struggling.\n\nMartin Brader, you'll like this one. We've had 9 secretaries of state for education in 12 years. How can that be considered a priority? How long do you need in a job to get on top of the get on top of things and make a difference? Dord says schools asking parents for money To fund basics, is this not incremental privatization?\n\nAnd, Tim Roche, I'd like to know your thoughts on lifting a grammar school moratorium. Will it increase inequality? Well, I can answer that one very, very briefly. Yes. It would.\n\nSo, Rory, what do you think? It's true, isn't it? We don't hear you know, when when When I was working with Tony Blair, priority education, education, education, I think we did focus on that, but it doesn't really get into the debate in a way that it used to. It's\n\nSpeaker 1: difficult, isn't it? Very difficult, very tough. And I don't don't know what's going on there because everybody gets that, fundamentally, if we're ready to transform our economy, get our growth going, We need much, much higher quality education, and Britain is, very sadly, behind In a loss of the international metrics and league tables, even on very basic stuff like like literacy and maths, and That's not good. And we you know, all the drives of various governments to get STEM subjects off the ground haven't paid off as much as people had hoped. We're not getting as many people into Science, technology, engineering, maths as we'd hoped, compared to, you know, we were talking on this in the podcast, the incredible figures that are being achieved in China in terms of Engineering graduates.\n\nSo, no, we've got to talk about it more. But maybe it's just another example of something that people struggle to get stories out of because A lot of it is so detailed. It's to do with everything from how you fund teachers' pensions to how you deal with Students with special needs, how you deal with school exclusions, how you deal with curriculum, how you deal with decaying school buildings, and maybe this stuff is just difficult to communicate.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the other thing sorry to get onto one of my regular hobby horses, but, you know, 7% of the country use private education. But if you get the figure for, for example, the cabinet, which is one of the most privately educated we've ever had, If you get the figure for seed leading editors and commentators, many of them use private schools for their own children. And I think that the state system, is not treated with the respect that it needs within the national debate. I think that is one of the reasons that Those who control the terms of national debate, too many of them, either have their own experience in private education or experience with their children. And, certainly, large parts of the media, in my view, cover state schools either not at all or as a basket case, when, actually, If we all came together, and this is this is the lesson from Canada and from Finland and from those countries that are always right up near the top of the p's and e tables is that where there is a societal commitment to state education, then the state education is a lot stronger.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And I think I'm sure you're right that people report well thoughtfully about things they understand. And if All these dominant voices in the media and politics are privately educated that simply don't understand what they're talking about. Really cheeky question here, but I thought it was I thought it was I was cheeky, but but it it was it was maybe worth worth having a go at you on. So Rupert Carlton Jones, I've just listened to Alastair's interview with Stephen Mangan On his Confessions Show, where Alastair confessed to never having done anything practical in his life, including never having cooked a meal.\n\n1, was Rory aware of this? 2, is Fiona an actual saint? 3, if he tells us he has never changed to nappy, I think I may have to stop Listening.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Rory, I told you last week, we were getting comments from people that they felt that Question Time Was not as serious as the main podcast, and most of our listeners, I think, wanted to stay serious. Yeah. Tell me Tell me this is\n\nSpeaker 1: you've become a politician you're trying to avoid. Tell me this\n\nSpeaker 0: is serious. Tell me. I'm happy to answer it.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is terrific. I'm happy to answer it. Want to hear something else. That's exactly channels. Those Tory politicians here.\n\nI don't think they want them. I think the listeners want to know what\n\nSpeaker 0: lies wants to hear about is my views on what's happening in Azerbaijan. That's right. Look. It's true that I it's not strictly true that I've never cooked a meal. I've cooked 1 meal in my life.\n\nIt was a tuna and potato souffle.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh my goodness.\n\nSpeaker 0: In the it was in the early days of my and Fiona's courtship 42, 43 years ago.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and and we can we can conclude we can conclude it did not Very well.\n\nSpeaker 0: If that's okay. It was okay, although she did have to help me. I I am not proud of my lack of practicality. I'm not proud of the fact that I don't know how to change a plug. I don't know how to change a tire.\n\nI'm not proud of it, but it's just I'm I think I'm good at some things, and I'm not good at other things. Is Fiona a saint? I think probably. Yeah. I think she's pretty close.\n\nAnd what was the 3rd part of this?\n\nSpeaker 1: It it so he said if he tells us he's never changed a nappy\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I changed loads of nappies.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I changed\n\nSpeaker 0: loads of nappies. I think that I think Fiona would say that even though I had a very, very, very, very busy job for much of their childhood, I was very good at being a dad, But I was probably only good at the things that she I didn't do things like you know, I like taking them out. I like playing with them. I like going on and playing football with the boys. But, No.\n\nI'm not proud of it, Rory. I'm very, very impractical. But shall we move on to something a bit less?\n\nSpeaker 1: John here. Can I give some more suggestions? Sorry about that. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's go for Let's go for Biden trust. Paul Harrison, I get the sense that the Biden administration is fed up with the UK. How is the special relationship holding up? Ruth Wilkinson, is the Biden snub to trust, this was Biden not seeing trust in the margins of the funeral, significant? Is this about him signalling his priority for Northern Ireland, and is that relevant to the trade deal?\n\nAnd Jeremy Huer, how important do you think Biden's Irish heritage is in relation to his dealings with the UK. So I do think it's, you know, I I think it would have been pretty extraordinary If it had been any previous prime minister, if there'd been a president in town and there was no meeting, I think that was pretty I do think that was pretty big.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really a bit odd. And she could have got to the airport Seen and done almost anything. It's very, very strange. I I do think that it's certainly true that Biden began his presidency with a lot of reservations about Britain. And, I remember when we were dealing with him over Iraq, we're now going back to 2005, 2006, a friend of mine went into a meeting with then vice president Biden And tried to explain the situation between Sunni and Shia.\n\nAnd he said, I get it. I get it. They don't like each other. It's like me and the Brits. I'm Irish.\n\nSo That that there is definitely a background there of him making jokes about not liking British people.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is that being public? Is that is that is that a known fact?\n\nSpeaker 1: Don't know don't know whether people have been talking much about that, but definitely he's\n\nSpeaker 0: I've heard him I've heard him make similar comments about his mother\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. But not about himself. Not about himself. Yeah. So but I think since he's come in, he's been, practical.\n\nAnd like many American presidents, he understands special relationship matters a lot to Britain. It's worth bearing in mind the special relationship point that somebody tried to track how many times the United States uses variants on special relationship, and they use it for Something like 9 or 10 different countries. Obviously, they, you know, they would do it in a particular way in relation to Israel. They'd do it in a particular way in relation to to, you know, many, many other places their partner with Canada, etcetera. But I think he's okay in his relationship to Britain.\n\nI definitely don't think he's gonna put up with something that might lead to The breaking of the Northern Ireland protocol there.\n\nSpeaker 0: But that's what he fears is on the cards, and that's possibly why he has been indicating. And we've said before, I I think at some point, I really do hope he comes up and says in black and white why it would be so dangerous to the so called special relationship. I my sense of the Americans on a special relationship is that they they only say it in reference to Britain when when the British media around. I don't think they kind of feel it in the way that we maybe feel it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's a good question, Tim Bell. He's a very smart professor, teaches at London, Does a lot on Twitter worth following people who are political geeks, but he just asked us. The government has basically written a huge blank check worth at least a £100,000,000,000. If you ran the country and could write such a big blank check, what single thing would you spend the money on? I guess he's talking about the fact that the choice was to spend a 150,000,000,000 probably On capping energy prices, is that what you would have done, or would you have done something else for the money?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh my god. A 150,000,000,000. I mean, you can do a lot with a 150,000,000,000. You have to bear in mind, though, it's being borrowed. Yep.\n\nSo it's not as it were. It's not that you've got a 150,000,000,000 in the bank. How do you spend it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a huge amount. Right? Sort of it's probably about 20% of government expenditure in a normal year.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll tell you I'll tell you what. This probably sounds a bit crazy Yep. Given that one of my sort of Actions in life is the the utter revolution of an in our approach to mental health understanding and services. My god. If you had a £150,000,000,000 to invest in the mental health of the nation, we would be able to fix an awful lot of things.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd I'd spend it on adult social care. So it the the real shame that I always felt as an MP, and it hasn't been dealt with at all, is the poor elderly Currently get about 15 minutes of care a day. It's not enough really to wash them, let alone feed them. And it's the great unfinished revolution. The NHS never really extended to care for the frail elderly.\n\nWe should be using it to provide free care to the frail elderly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Good. Here's a good one. Rob Lenzi. Just watched Jacinda Ardern on the BBC. Listen to Mark Drakeford on the rest of his politics.\n\nThey both communicate so much more clearly than the leaders we see in Westminster. Why do you think that is? I did think about Mark Drakeford last week. I I listened back to it a couple of times. I I I really like the fact that he just answered the questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. He he sort of does, doesn't he? I mean, he he He sometimes answers the missing out bits. I mean, he's still a politician. Right?\n\nI mean, it's not No.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory, I think you're being very harsh on him. I I think you're finding it very difficult. Fiona I'm gonna pass on a point that Fiona made. She came back from walking the dog, having listened to the podcast, and she said, Rory doesn't like admitting that Labour politicians are very effective.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't like committing any politicians are very effective, I think, if you were honest. I think she I think Fiona needs to needs to No.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I don't know. I think you'd be I think you'd be unfair. I think he answered the questions very, very clearly, and I think he answered them In a way that I I I had a lot of reactions like that. We had a lot of reactions, to the to the podcast on from people saying they found it really refreshing that he he basically listened to the question, then he answered it, and then he started a a debate around it. So So you don't agree with the premise?\n\nI don't quite agree.\n\nSpeaker 1: I found I found I mean, I had stiffer one. We we should come back to this. I still found him a little bit on the boring side, but maybe this isn't isn't the time to be having this discussion. Okay. Now, there was a good question I thought, which was, which goes to the heart of stuff that you know and that people are very interested in.\n\nSo, Seb Elson, Watching the funeral queen Elizabeth, noticed Jordan Brown, Shri Blair talking while seated next to each other. What's the relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown now? He goes on to say, would you say they're friends? He finds the dynamic between XPMs fascinating, particularly when you see Johnson May, Cameron Brown, Blair and Major altogether. Are they friends?\n\nAre they close friends? Or is that not the right way of putting it?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think I think they were there was a time in their Relationship in opposition when they were very, very, very close friends, politically and personally. I think that the strains and stresses of government Meant that due there were periods during our time in in office when it well, this is no secret. You know? There are 8 volumes of it, when things became quite strained. But I'd say they are.\n\nI think that their relationship is is a lot better. I think there's a I think there's a A real mutual respect, that they both have. But equally, they've gone on to do they're both still very active and very You've been very involved, but they, you know, they they don't, as it were, do stuff together in the way that for most of their their careers, they did. I've I've found that that we talked in on the main podcast about how interesting it was with all the body all the the sort of People watching that you could do at the funeral. I did find that, you know, because we've had so many prime ministers in these last 12 years of conservative failure, Rory, austerity, Brexit, conservatives devaluation disaster.\n\nWe now have more former prime ministers than we've ever had in our history. One of my favorite moments of the entire funeral service was when the archbishop of Canterbury, he he was definitely looking at Boris Johnson when he said the line about people who really serve will be remembered long after those who sought to cling on to power and privilege. I I thought that was a that was a very, very, very good line.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's also a good line from an archbishop. I guess it's something we really wanna.\n\nSpeaker 0: Was that the main sermon, wasn't it? I thought it was really good. It was it was short. It was punchy.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's also for for kinda historical geeks. It's amazing the role of, clergymen giving speeches in these royal contexts. A lot of what was going on In Shakespeare's plays is responding to the other great dramatic moments in Elizabeth and early Jack B in England, which were about Priests challenging the queen and the king in their Sunday sermons, and this went all the way back to Henry the 8th. The queens and kings had to sit there and listen to sometimes quite radical preachers who pop up on a Sunday, An hour and a half, 2 hours seminar lecturing them on the sins of the kings and all this kind of thing. John Knox, of course, is a great one at doing this to to James first of Scotland.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I thought what I liked about the archbishop's, contribution, I I thought there was a there was a personality to it. I didn't think the readings were very good. I wasn't that moved by the hymns, and I I do like a I do like a nice hymn.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't you didn't like the lord's my shepherd. That's alright.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah. That was fine. That was fine. But that's Kind of, you know, that that is but but I just felt the the readings could have maybe been a had a bit more personal and personality in them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And here we are back again with the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell. Andrew Kitching wants to know I don't know if you've been to state funerals, Rory. What's your most memorable state funeral from your days in government. Mine actually is very, very close to where you're sitting right now. It was king Hussein.\n\nSpeaker 1: There was a very sad point of your of your mother's death. Was that the same event you had\n\nSpeaker 0: witnessed in the No. No. No. My I would no. No.\n\nNo. It wasn't. I was I was that was separate. I was in Jordan when my mother died. But, no, the King Hussein's funeral, which which was\n\nSpeaker 1: What what what do you remember about it?\n\nSpeaker 0: I just remember the elements of chaos. I remember when we were reading about the build up to The queen's funeral, and there was the whole thing about the the the leaders would have to go on a bus. And Biden's people say there's no way he's gonna get a bus, And then the other leaders say, well, why do cannot why do I have to go to bus if he's not on a bus? And all that stuff. And there was there was everyone was taken to this kind of Vast I I I in my diary, I call it a holding palace.\n\nEvery sort of bundled into this palace. And so what you had was these Literally hundreds of of dignitaries from different parts of the world bumping into each other. Remember, Chirac and Clinton having what they Clinton was joking. It was one of the sort of, you know, one of the best bilaterals he'd ever had, and it was literally on a staircase, while across the way, There was another bilateral going on between, you know, the the Israeli and the Jordanian, and then down the stairs, Tony Blair had bumped into the German chancellor. And they were just It was the it was like this kind of and, of course, people were being respectful, but there were no cameras in there.\n\nSo it was literally it was like a political bazaar. People were thinking, right. I can get. I remember on the walk down, they would then have to walk down to the to the burial. And it was like you could See the leaders who were desperately trying to get in the shot behind Clinton.\n\nThere's all this Right. Right. Right. Right. Going on.\n\nAnd people who were Just wanting to I remember Clinton turning to Sherrack at one point and saying, hey, Jack. How many bilaterals? You know, I done 30 down the staircase. I did 12 in that little room with the coffee. And it was just it was just chaos.\n\nIt was but it was something wonderful about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Now we we had a we had a question from somebody About apologies. Lewis Thomas asked, could you please give some insight on why there are many historic wrongs the governments acknowledge but don't apologize for? An example being the Amritsar massacre. And so that's an interesting one.\n\nSo I think the queen laid a wreath at Amritsar. Amritsar was where General Dyer opened fire on a crowd in Amritsar. It's a very, very big scene in the film Gandhi that people will will remember. Queen Lady wreath in 97. David Cameron said it was deeply shameful in 2013.\n\n2019, Theresa May said, we deeply regret what happened and the suffering and calls. She called it a shameful scar in British Indian history, but she didn't apologize. What's going on that they say all these things, but they just somehow Full sort of apologizing.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't know in relation to that one. You probably know more about it than I do. I there is something strange about the extent to which Politicians and governments don't like to apologize, and yet some of the most powerful moments come from apology. Was it Kevin Rudd who was prime minister Australia when he apologized for the treatment of the indigenous population? Right.\n\nI people often say that one of David Cameron's finest moments was his response to the bloody Sunday inquiry. And I guess what that says is that sometimes it's easier to for things that have happened that were not, as it were, directly your fault, your responsibility.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and that's definitely true with the Emirates Massacre. I mean, why why wouldn't you do it? I mean, if you're gonna say it's deeply shameful, it's an indelible scar on Britain's reputation, I mean, you basically have apologized. So why not just say, And we profoundly apologize.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't know is the answer on that. I don't know why you wouldn't do that. I imagine at the time, there would have been Political pressures possibly from other parts of Indian politics, other parts of the region's politics. I just don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or or what maybe people are saying with when it comes to British empire that it's not quite clear where you'd ever stop. And, you know, are you gonna be how Far back, are you gonna go with your apologies? Are you gonna apologize for what happened 300 years ago, 400 years ago, etcetera?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I saw I saw in the in the The build up of The Queen's Funeral, the interview with a member of the Greek establishment and was onto the theme of the Elgin Marbles. And, I've often wondered about that, whether it's because it's it's a kind of where do you draw the line? Once you've conceded a principle, about where something rightfully belongs. What then is the next one? I don't know, but it's a I I I think there is because in that we know in our own lives But, actually, apology often can be very healing and very strengthening.\n\nI actually think that the public are far more Tolerant to people apologizing, although you might you may remember Nick Clegg where he apologized for tuition fees. I mean, that do you remember? And he's The he he he was immediately sort of lampooned by some of the best memes that were ever made.\n\nSpeaker 1: One one of the questions on your that education question that you read right at the beginning of this episode commented on ministers turning over so quickly. And Yeah. Clearly, that is very, very, very fundamental to our entire problems in governance. I mean, we talked about that. We've had, you know, 6 France actually is in whatever it is, 8 years compared to 6 24 years.\n\nSpeaker 0: But 9 education sectors in 12 years, that's pretty extraordinary, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely unbelievable. But if you, You know, in my my ministerial career, I was in my 1st job for just under 12 months as environment minister. I was then Middle East, Asian minister for, I think, Another 12 months, African minister for probably 7 months, prisons minister for 14 months. I mean, it's completely mad. And so we've got this odd situation where on the one hand, we pretend that ministers run things.\n\nSo we've got a sort of slightly headless chicken situation where our entire constitution It's based on this idea that civil servants advise ministers decide. And if there aren't strong ministers in place, often there's real inertia, and it's very difficult for stuff to get done. But on the other hand, the civil service are very, very aware that the ministers are going to be swapped over every year or at most every 2 years. And so if a minister comes in with very Strong views wants to do something. They will be very aware that their successor may well not want to do that, and there's no point going down that path.\n\nI mean, I felt this again and again. I would try to ThinkAI was being bold, doing something really big on and then doubling different spend on environment and climate change, and I couldn't understand the resistance. But now I realize that, of course, they're thinking, Well, if we go right over the top and make a 2,000,000,000 commitment for this guy, the next woman or man coming in is is likely to traverse it. So why would we do it?\n\nSpeaker 0: We've had all those jobs, Roy. I'm about to give you another job, Hobbit king. If you could work, asking us both, if you could work for any prime minister in history, who would it be and why?\n\nSpeaker 1: For for me, I would definitely work for William Gladstone.\n\nSpeaker 0: What would your job be?\n\nSpeaker 1: Blimey. I'd do anything from my carrier's bag. I'd be his chief of Staff, I I I don't understand. What I love about him is the sense that he got so much more radical as he got older. I love people who start as It's kind of rigid conservatives as he did.\n\nHe started as the defender of the slave trade and finished as one of our most liberal prime ministers ever trying to Solve the problems in Ireland. In fact, if he'd got his home rule bill through, he may well have been able to save such untold misery. And and the older he got, the more radical he got. And I I there's there's a lovely interview which I'm completely obsessed with with Samuel Beckett towards the end of his life where A French interviewer is asking him, does you know, he's in his eighties. Do you miss your youth?\n\nAnd Beckett says, not with the fire that's in me now.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's interesting because I was utterly obsessed by Samuel Beckett when I was at university, including making pilgrimages to Paris to try and track him down in cafes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you find him? No.\n\nSpeaker 0: I found him once, and it was very done. And very unsatisfying. I think I'd go for Atlee.\n\nSpeaker 1: Uh-huh. What would you do for him?\n\nSpeaker 0: I just would have liked to have observed him because he's I I do think he's one of those prime ministers that Genuinely changed the country for the better. And, obviously, that era was very, very special in our history. I was probably I probably would've I'd like to I think that would have been quite an interesting job.\n\nSpeaker 1: You definitely would have been a bit more oomph. His speeches were phenomenally boring, so could have could have done with you. Although Adly had these Incredibly dominating charismatic figures in his cabinet, Bevan Bevan and others. I mean, I I and that's slightly what I worry Labour's lacking at the moment. I'm we're lacking these Huge big beast that that was the secret for these team of rivals.\n\nHere's a question not for today, but to put us on our metal For us to answer next week Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't think we can do it. We'll humiliate ourselves if we try now. But Fabiana Lopez da Silvera, I'm an enthusiastic yet slightly frustrated Brazilian listener of your podcast. As you constantly namedrop Bolsonaro as a token example of the rise of Mainly right wing populism across the globe, but never actually talk about him or Brazil in general. So here is my challenge.\n\nThe both of you spend at least 5 straight minutes commenting on Brazilian politics, including former president Lula, Who's leading all the polls even though Bolsonaro insists that it's all a lie?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, actually, Roy, I would be very happy to spend 5 minutes talking about that right now, but, however, I have to be in the dentist chair in a few minutes. So but I'm happy I'm happy. I think she I think Fabian is right. I think we given that Brazil is such an enormous country, given the Bolsonaro is such a controversial figure, and Lula is a very controversial figure too. We probably have been a little bit remiss in not talking more about the Brazilian election.\n\nSo, yeah, let's do that let's do that next week.\n\nSpeaker 1: I really think that thing about the dentist is a bit cheeky. I don't think most of our listeners believe that you can do 5 minutes nonstop on Brazilian politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: I well, I can, and I will do with the\n\nSpeaker 1: dentist today. And I will\n\nSpeaker 0: if you like, I will film myself I will film myself in the dentist chair. Share. No. Go on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do it next\n\nSpeaker 0: to the do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: I believe you do it Brazil.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's why why don't why don't we close on on something a little bit lighter? It's perfectly obvious to me from responses just walking around the place and on social media that, Peter Morgan's film, The Queen, was obviously played at some point on television in recent days, because there were quite a lot of questions of it about it. Sam Galloway asks me how frustrating was it to be portrayed as a caricature in queen. Ed, did you like your portrayal in The Thick of It? Rory, who would you like to play you if a film was made of your life?\n\nAnd lots of questions just asking, what did I think of the movie The Queen, and what do I think of the New Labour portrayals and the actors who have played me? So let's do you first. Who would you like to? I know you said Danny DeVito the last time we were asked this, but what's a serious answer? Who would you like to play it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Just play me.\n\nSpeaker 0: It has to be one of those posh boy actors, wouldn't it? Damon Lewis, Benedict Cumberbatch, one of the Italian Hirovians.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm a huge, huge fan of Eddie Redmayne. And in certain lights\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. He looks like you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Much better looking version myself. So maybe that maybe that would be the way to go.\n\nSpeaker 0: Have you seen Private Eye this week?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I didn't see Private Eye this week.\n\nSpeaker 0: You are in Private Eye. Please don't get scared. You are in prime eye as the you know, the thing where they do, are they, by any chance, related? And it's you And Abraham Lincoln. And the caption says, don't let anybody be fooled by Lincoln's beard.\n\nAnd you do have that Eddie Redmayne sort of lined face look, both of you. So let's go with Eddie Redmayne, playing Rory Stewart, Abraham Lincoln.\n\nSpeaker 1: Cool. And what's what's your answer to those questions here?\n\nSpeaker 0: I saw The Queen was an extraordinary film because it didn't portray the Queen or Tony Blair as caricatures, ticket tours, but it did play it did portray the other characters, me, Duke of Edinburgh, Cheri Blair. I think we were caricatured, but that maybe that's just because they don't have, you You know, the the central story was the relationship between the queen and the prime minister, and I thought they were very well portrayed. I I've been played by quite a lot of actors in quite a lot of different films. The best one, I think, was the guy who played me, I don't like The subject matter, but I hats off to the guy who played me, was was the the film about Davy Kelly. I think it was called Death of a Government Inspector.\n\nI was Ian Duncan Smith's son is an actor, and he played me\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, well, there we are. That's a thing.\n\nSpeaker 0: In a play at some some point. Now I never saw the play, but people tell me that he was, he was quite good. So I\n\nSpeaker 1: my my great moment of glory is there was a play about me at the, Hampstead Theatre, and I got played by an actor who'd acted as a Quidditch captain in Harry Potter. There we are. Now then, final final question going. Emily Dreyston, does either of you have a favorite Scots word or phrase? She says hers are out with and scumnered.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mine is Glakit. My mom used that a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Tell us about Glakit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Glakit basically means gormless.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. My fellow liked Skunnered. He loved saying So you need to be Oh, yeah. Yeah. Wished.\n\nYeah. And Scottish politics, as you know, they love the word as a way of getting at each other. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.\n\nThanks. Enjoy the dentist. I\n\nSpeaker 0: will try.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we look forward to your both scenario. Crowd. It's\n\nSpeaker 0: a cray it it's very relevant. It's a crowd, and the weekend will be good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Crown just opens for a good your your own crown. Alright. Lots of love. See you soon.\n\nSpeaker 0: Best. Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.",
