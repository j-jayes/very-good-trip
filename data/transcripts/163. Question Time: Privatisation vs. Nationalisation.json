To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show Just go to the rest is politics.com. That's the rest is politics.com. Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Very good. And, Alastair, you have a very, very splendid shirt on. I have my what you call my Penrith Veth shirts on, but you have something which looks more like sort of Saturday Night Live. It's a car driving across my chest. That's very good. I'm already into cars. Fiona has this sort of desire, I think, for me to be a man that I'm not. Oh. So she regularly will go out and buy me shirts like this? Well, it's interesting because you definitely have a desire for me to be a man that I'm not. So I I I think that you're obviously passing on. Rory, I I have no desire over you. You do have a perpetual desire for me to be a football loving, beer drinking dude? Can you remember the name of the Bulgarian detached law footballer? No. Sadly not. Come on. What's his name again? Kostadidov. Listen. Let's get a a couple of quick easy ones out of the way to start with. Okay? I'm going to reward some perseverance. Michael Rees, question attempt number 18. And I've checked. He has asked this question 18 times. So stop whinging all you people who say I've asked Question 8 times, 9 times, 10 times. Michael Rees' question is quite simple, Rory. Will we go to Cardiff to do a show in 2024? Wales is the only nation in the UK that we've not hosted a show yet. We'll definitely go to Wales, and Cardiff sounds like a good spot. Right? Yeah. Well, there doesn't have to be Cardiff. I think we've gotta be, you know, I, by the way, Michael, have been to Wales at least 3 times in the last few months. And here's another very quick snappy one we can do, Roy. Cheeong Ra MP. Few people have got in touch to say on a recent podcast, you couldn't think of any MPs with a scientific background, so I thought I'd send you a link to the BBC's live Scientific episode That Coven Mine. So there you go. We'll put that in the, in the newsletter. I'd like to pay tribute to Chee. So Chee Did a lot with me in the early days on mobile coverage and broadband. And absolutely she is a person with a serious scientific background in parliament, As, of course, as I've pointed out, is Therese Coffey, who's got a doctorate in strange bits of biochemistry. And who whose name keeps appearing in stories about the pending reshuffle. Hey ho. Now let's have a couple here on education, even though the first one from Kate Grant is only the 8th time that she's asked it. Kate from Buxton, over 20% of secondary age young people have been persistently absent from school this year, and the suspension rate is 49% higher in 2020 2, that in 2017, is the education system in England fundamentally broken? If so, how can it be fixed? Kath, given the growing rates of absences in our schools, is our education system fit for purpose anymore? And should educators rather than politicians not be at the forefront of a front of a complete overhaul. Why aren't labor being bolder in their education policy as currently, it seems to be more of the same? So what what do you think accounts for the growing absences from school? What's What's going on there? I think a lot of it is COVID. I think it's children who got used to not going to school and then found it hard to go back. But, actually, if I can Plug an excellent piece, which answers partly answers both questions from somebody I think you probably miss her actually, Rory, somebody called Fiona Miller, who's a a writer and a journalist specializing in education and parenting issues. Yeah. That's right. Fiona Miller. Yes. You've heard of Fiona Miller? Yes. I've heard of her. Yes. Yeah. I've I know her very, very well. Well, she's a mother of my 3 children. Yes, exactly. Anyway, we should put in the newsletter a piece she wrote in The Guardian which does try to answer this question. And I think the final point is Partly because of some of the things that Michael Gove, in his wisdom, undid that the Labour government had put in place. A lot of the support that's there for teachers has gone, And a lot of the outside school support has gone. I saw your friend Jillian Keegan recently said that teachers should sort of you know, if kids aren't turning up, the Schools should go and find them and all of them back in. But, of course, the schools are pretty overwhelmed as it is. So I think there's a whole load of things that were taken away that have not been replaced, and the the schools are operating at full pelt, and they're just not able to keep up with some of these kids who are not there. Gosh. I was also reading, actually, the US Department of Education struggling with the same thing. They've got about 16% absenteeism, and they're people with non native English much more likely to be absent, people with disabilities much more like be absent. I mean, it is such a problem. Shoshanna taught in very difficult schools, both in Harlem and in Boston, And there, they they did literally go to people's homes to try to find children and bring them in. And as you say, it's incredibly time consuming. I mean, it it it's sort of half broke. The teacher's trying to stay on top of that. And I do think the point of of labor and we talked in the main podcast about the government being behind on on the NHS. I do think that education. I really like Bridget Phillips, And I think she'd be a terrific secretary of state. But I think within the public debate, partly, I think, because the current education secretary, Gillian Keegan, is, I think, pretty low profile and doesn't Say much about education is it's just vanished from the debate. It's not at the center of our debate about what sort of future we want as a country. And, of course, we're going in, you know, in the next couple of weeks, we're gonna get a levels. We're gonna get GCSE results. And we're going to get them at a point Where you've had kids who've had the whole COVID experience is bad enough, and then now you also you've had the teacher strikes as some of the marking issues have not been resolved. You're gonna have all sorts of kids not getting downgraded because of some of the changes that have been made in the marketing systems. And I just think these are things that because they're not if I may revisit one of my my central scenes, because so many of our leading journalists and editors use private schools. I don't think they focus on education nearly as much as they should. And I think that that is another reason why the politicians don't focus on it as much as they should either. So here's a couple of questions, I think. Sam Calvert Smith, a while ago, you pledged to do a good news only episode. I realize it's almost impossible at the moment, but wondered if between you, you could find any good news that we are asked to come with some good news for us. Well, look, one person's the definition of news that was one of the greatest definitions of of news ever, news is something that somebody, somewhere doesn't want to see printed. Right? So I would argue that it's good news that Donald Trump has been indicted again. Right? But it's bad news for Donald Trump. But I you know, we talked the other day about there's a serious point to this because we talked recently about the the the Canadian legislation where they're changing The the arrangements with Meta and Google and what have you. And when we were looking into that, I came across this piece on The Conversation, which had some figures. I think it for the UK, it was 46 ticks. Percent of people who now deliberately avoid the news, and that's massive. But it's it's unbelievable, and it's it's fatal for politics because Yeah. Politics are the center of the news, And obviously democracy depends on informed citizens and holding people accountable. And once almost half your population is actively refusing to visit these. How on earth are you supposed to hold politicians accountable? Yeah. So here's a good bit of news for you. Scientists have found a naturally occurring strain of bacteria which can Stop transmission malaria. That is good news. That's quite exciting. So they went and looked at the 2014 experiment, Went back and looked at it again, and they think that this may be a real breakthrough. And, of course, malaria still kills 600,000 people Every year. So there we are. There's something a little bit of good news for you. Generally, if you go on the BBC, BBC's got uplifting news, but most of it tends to be about Teddy bears stuck on the top of mountains or rescuing dolphins and dogs. Or No. Listen. I try to defend the BBC. The BBC's online top Ten stories is becoming absurd and ridiculous at times. The BBC is a serious news organization. Can they please focus on serious news? Thank you very much. Over and out. Right. Dan Taylor, I'm enjoying reading Rory's book about the Scottish Borders' walks with his dad. I love the reference to his dad saying, Archimedes, every time tea is poured. Why is this Rory? And then he follows up. For Alastair, if you've been brought up by Rory's father, can you imagine how your worldview might differ? And do you think you would gravitated to being a Tory? Okay. Let me try Archimedes, and then we'll throw this thing. So my father was completely I I think you would have enjoyed meeting him. He was born in 1920 To he fought in the war, he became an intelligence officer. He was trained to land in small submarines off the coast of Borneo during confrontation with Sukarno. He was A passionate Scott. He was very close to his brother, which is 2 little boys. Their father was in India. My grandfather was in India. And these 2 little boys, Grew up in Kirimira and Angus and then went off to war together, and his brother, who was just a year old and him, was killed fighting with the Black Watch in Sicily. And my father never really, I think, Develop close male friends again after that. Oh wow. Is that why you joined the Black Watch, by the way? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. My father, my uncle, my grandfather, my great grandfather, yeah. My father was so proud of being Scottish and kind of petulantly and childishly anti English at almost every opportunity he was given. Would he want Australia to beat England in the world the Women's World Cup semifinal tomorrow? Well, I think he'd be quite amused by that sort of thing. But his sort of Scottishness was much more about he loved trying to improve his Gaelic, he Love playing his chanter. He was very interested in Scottish music, Scottish place names he was very interested in. I mean, he'd wear tartan trues in Vietnam to To give a sort of sense of kind of how what a sort of campaigning Scotty was. Anyway, the Archimedes' point is that he was terrified about the fact that when you pour a teapot, He worried that the lids are going to fall off the teapot, and Archimedes was some sort of way of him talking about the leverage problems. He actually basically felt the entire family were really messy and And all we were ever gonna do was pour tea all over the place. And as a result, his mother-in-law was so terrified by him that every time he came to visit her, she'd just pour tea everywhere. Right. The bid for me, if I had been brought up by your father, can I imagine that my worldview might differ? Yes. Do I think I would therefore have gravitated to being a Tory. Definitely not. Absolutely not. It would have made me even more labor. I I must tell you, Roy, I wasn't gonna tell you this until I saw you face to face, but I am carrying with me, because you have a significant birthday coming up Oh, yes. A book written by the man in the foreign service who followed your dad in Hanoi. Oh. But unlike your dad, He traveled with a really, really high quality camera and took some amazing photographs and has published a rather beautiful book about his time in Hanoi there just after your dad left. So there you go. So I've got a copy of that book for you, which I shall be presenting to you from my friend, John Ramsden, tickers. On your significant birthday, there you are. Freddie Jewett, what is your view on Dominic Cummings' start up t, brackets, c sub stack, brackets. Where is he right wrong? On the problems with the status quo party and white hall setups, focus on media rather than voters, Systems thinking approach to policies and government, lack of, I imagine, and the key problems and policy areas for the UK. Now I I haven't read Dominic Cubbing's Peace on Substack. But if he's saying that there should be a new start up party or that if there is one, it should focus on the problems with the status quo party, white all setups, focus on media, not voters, systems thinking approach, etcetera. And I know these are things that he's banged on about for some time. And I think although I come at it from a very, very different political perspective to his. I do think there is something fundamentally wrong with our politics, and I think it's partly what gave us Brexit. I think it's partly what's given us this succession of, I think, pretty useless prime ministers. And it's partly what's making people frustrated that the Labour Party is not sort of coming in with that sense of real change and radical change that the country's crying out for. Yeah. So Cummings and Cummings are really interesting character. I think he's a he has actually done a lot of harm. I think him endorsing and getting behind Boris Johnson was Terrible, because I think Boris Johnson was a terrible, terrible prime minister, and Dominic Cummings enabled him and should bear responsibility for that. And it's no good him them saying, Now that he's left, the guy's like a shopping trolley careering around. He should've known that in advance, and he shouldn't have enabled that. But, of course, what he is good at is the negative critique bit. I don't think He's actually very good at positively running the country, but his critique, which he put in a substack, I think you'd agree with a lot of. He says that Rishi Sunak is diligent, but is mostly dealing with second order issues. And this then is his criticism. He says there's no grip of power. He says the Cabinet Office is a dumpster fire. There's no governing plan for the NHS, crime, the war, productivity, growth, r and d, or anything else. No message, no serious polling communications or political machine, no political strategy worth spit, a humiliating Awful level of argument on every major issue reduced to defending idiot MPs and political disintegration. So as with a lot of these people, I think he's got Clear eyed analysis of what's wrong, but I don't think that means that I want Dominic Cummings in running the country again. Here we are. Question on Ecuador from Louise Barrett. Interested to hear more on your thoughts of what's gone on in Ecuador. Hadn't realized how fractious it was there. Any insight is welcome. So very quickly on that one for listeners. Ecuador has had a horrible, horrifying explosion of drug violence. In fact, one of the things that's been happening across Central Latin America has been an explosion from old centers in Colombia and Mexico, partly to do with the disintegration of Venezuela, of criminal drug gangs right the way across the continent. And this has resulted in Ecuador in these moments of political violence. And the leading anti corruption campaigner in the presidential election being killed, and now another major local politician being assassinated in the lead up to the election. And now even as we're speaking, a third, somebody called Pedro Brillonis, who was an organizer for citizen revolution, that's literally just been announced. So, I mean, it does sort of bring home as well that there are parts of the world I mean, we've had political assassinations, Joe Cox, David Amess. But I think for people to be out on the campaign stump as they are now and, clearly, The sense is that the 1st guy who was murdered, Fernando Villavista Vicencio, he has been very, very vocal Speaking out against corruption, against the drug gangs, and and so forth. And, you know, the suspicion is that they're the ones who wiped him out. So it's a classic kind of, you know, mafia style silencing operation. And a reminder how quickly things can change in the modern world because Ecuador, you would have said a decade ago Yeah. Was A pretty stable, peaceful place and it's just in the last 5 years that it's basically become like Colombia in the 90s. And there are whole bits So the country now controlled by these criminal drug gangs. So it's a real reminder of how fragile countries and politics can be that the kind of assumptions that you would have had 5, 6 years ago can be turned on their heads so rapidly the way these international criminal gangs can just destroy a state. And I didn't I'm I can't claim to you on this. But you may know more than I do. But is it not the case that Ecuador doesn't have its own drug trade as such, but it's sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, and therefore is essential to their kinda roots, the trafficking groups. Next question. Tony Blair Institute, a force for good. Ralfi, is the Blair Institute for Global Change, a force Good. Hugo Almond, having read the news about Tony Blair and his Saudi connections, wouldn't it be wise for Keir Starmer to keep as much distance as possible From this heavily tainted predecessor, that's a slightly unfair question to you because, obviously, Tony Blair is somebody you admire immensely. Somebody somebody you admire immensely as well, Rory. I'd also like Tony Blair very much. But there's been some very interesting reporting, which I think would be fair for us to report on, which has Been getting into the funding and the way in which it's funded by Larry Ellison and some of the different ways in which the money is generated. There was a Really interesting detailed article written by Tom McTague. Tom McTague is a a really interesting long form journalist who did some really good reporting on Long Island, Did a very interesting profile of Boris Johnson, was a correspondent with The Atlantic and has spent the last few weeks getting into real detail on the on the funding of the Tony Blair Institute. So I think it's it's worth reading. I mean, it's a very interesting account. I don't think I came out of it feeling that Tony Blair was guilty of great wrongdoing, But it it is an interesting example of some of the perils of how you fund yourself and what happens when you have to try to raise tens of 1,000,000 of dollars a year, often in his case for good tickets. He's using this money to do a lot of support for governance work and delivery work in developing countries around the world, but an interesting long form piece. Well, I've not read it. I was vaguely aware of the stories because I was getting phone calls from journalists asking if I wanted to say anything about them, and and I didn't. But as you raise as you raise on the podcast, I will. No. I I think that Tony left office in 2007. And I think he struggled for a while to establish exactly how he was going to kind of operate. I think he has now found his feet, and he runs this organization, which I think is a force for good. I think it's a force for good in the way that it contributes It's a public policy debate. I think it's a force for good as you say in some of the work that it does in some of the poorest parts of the world. I mean, Tony's Institute is operating in dozens of countries now and doing it in a way that I think is, You know, he he he with some of the work he's done in Africa has won a lot of praise from some of the organizations. He said that even some of the big charities were pulling out to some of the poorest places in the world. And I think what happened in the in the early years is that he he stopped being a politician in a way. He stopped explaining who he was and what he did, which which is part of what a modern politician has to do. And I think he's doing that more now, and I think it is giving people a better sense of of what he does. Now I don't know what canations he has with Mohammed bin Salman. I don't know what canations he has with with Saudis in terms of any financing. I just don't know. But I do know That he raises a lot of money in part to fund these projects and also in part to hire the people that he work that work for him. And he's now hiring Several 100 people, including people I keep saying to saying to people in around Giers Tharman, never mind Giers having a relationship with them. Hire some of these people because you've got some of the smartest people currently working in policy work going. Clare McCord, would love to hear your thoughts on the PSNI, Police service law null and data breach, particularly as I feel the seriousness of this may not be quite understood in the rest of the UK. Yep. In an age of constant breach that leaks people data. So Take it back then to end of February. John Caldwell, he's a detective chief inspector, is coaching some kids. He's leaning into the back of his car to put his footballs away And he is then shot from behind by 2 gunmen and ends up in hospital. And it's a reminder of the risk. And off the back of this, there's now been a data leak where the names and the stations of, I think almost every police officer in the police service in Northern Ireland. Under roles, crucially. So for example, you've got people who's, you know, role liaison with the security service, for example. You know, there's some pretty serious stuff there. And and the PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne, who's a very fine man, he has Been open about the fact, he says, they're now confident that dissident Republicans do have possession of this stuff. So, I mean, it's really, really alarming and really quite scary for a lot of people, this. And a reminder for all of us, I mean, it's incredibly, unfortunately, easy for this to happen, and we are so dependent, obviously, on data and IT, and it's complicated. I mean, I'm running a big charity at the moment where we're dealing with data in 14 different countries, and Every time you upgrade or move to a new system, there are going to be other forms of cyber challenges and backdoors. And Staying on top of this stuff is vital, particularly though for governments and particularly for something as sensitive as the police service in Northern Ireland. So I can't really understand how this happened, but I think it's Reminder for anyone listening that this stuff can happen so easily and does. And also, I don't think most people, when we're, You know? And I'm as bad I'm as guilty as anybody. But when when we're sort of, you know, just working on our computer and you're sitting there and it says accept this, decline that, Agree to this, not agree to that. I don't think we really think through what we're doing with that stuff, but this is clearly some sort of cyberattack. But the document had the names of around 10,000 office and staff. It had their surname, first initial, rank or grade, where they were based and the unit they work in and the responsibilities that they had. So that's a lot of information. And as you said earlier, John Caldwell, You know, they they obviously had the intelligence. They knew that that's what he did in his spare time. He coached kids' football. Now That's the sort of thing that you can probably find out anyway. But if you if you are wanting to target police officers, then having the information that they now have is It's pretty alarming. And terrifying obviously if you are a police officer in Orlando. I mean if you every time you go coaching football and are leaning into the back of your car to put the footballs away, you think 2 people are going to come up and shoot from behind. Your life becomes impossible. So here's a question for you. Jonah Woodward, what are your thoughts on the recent UFO congressional hearing in the US? I didn't know there was 1. Did you know there was 1? I I did, actually. I've been following I mean, it's it's the sort of thing that gets people very excited on social media. This is probably going to make every conspiracy theorist in the world think that I just don't like conspiracy theories, and I go over the top. But every time I see anything to do with UFOs and congressional inquiries. Am I wrong just to sort of turn off? I think you're absolutely right. There's been some wonderful graphs Almost all the UFOs spotted in the world have been spotted from the United States or Britain because clearly aliens are English speaking people. But then there's a town called which I I think maybe I talked about it before. There's a town called Bonnybridge, which is in the central belt in Scotland. Anyway, it's right next to Falkirk, so it's called the Falkirk Triangle. My friends Luke and Will went down there because they were really excited because they had 300 UFO Opting for the year, and they were really, really excited to go down there and see a UFO. And then a bit disappointed to discover that I think out of the 300 sightings, 298 have been made by the same man. So you have close friends who believe all this stuff? No. I don't I I don't know whether Will and Luke really believed it. I think Maybe their idea of a their sense of humor going down. But I have to say, Falkirk played a very, very important part in my life. Oh, yeah? Because it was there in 1986 at the Falkirk Labour Club that I was drunk for the last time in my life. Oh, very good. Very good. Very good. Well, that's true. That's prom one of the many, many reasons to love the Labour Party, Roy. But why why was that the last Time in your life, you behaved so badly that that was a turning point for you? That was when I about 3 hours later, I was arrested, and then I was locked And then I was taken to hospital, and then I was advised that, you know, this drinking at this level wasn't really very good for you. So good old Falkirk, I said. Well done, Falkirk. So, Anaset, let's take a break. I had one for you. You be you've been throwing questions at me deliberately provocative. Yeah. Matt, Rory spoke very highly of Alec's Chalk when he took over as justice secretary. What did he make there for of Alex Chalk's defense of Lee Anderson's comments on migrants? Well, obviously makes me a little bit uncomfortable. I think Alex Chalk, Cheltenham MP, he's very bright. He was a stalwart On Brexit, he he really worked hard to try to get a decent compromised Brexit deal together with me. He Push for customs union, I'm very proud he's justice secretary. I'm obviously disappointed by that. I think it's worth though bearing in mind, as somebody who It's been through the mill on this, and as you have too, that one of the problems is that you end up defending your party right or wrong, and it's very difficult for outsiders You quite appreciate the pressures that you're always under in a government to defend your colleagues, and I think, You know, I would try to find a way of sort of defending a little bit half heartedly and not getting out there, but it it's a tribal game, isn't it? It's a very tribal game. Let's say it had been you. You're the minister being sent out by Downing Street's spin doctors to defend everything the government says and does. Surely you, a civilized, reasonable, rational, well educated man, cannot possibly defend the comments of Lee Anderson. They're all over the papers this morning, which he told these poor bedraggle people getting on the Bibby Stockholm to fuck off back to France if they don't like it. Well, I Al Simon, thank you for the, the the the compliments towards what a civilized man I am. Obviously, I Wouldn't use that kinda language, but there is a serious issue here, which is the issue around whether or not France is a safe country. Okay. You wouldn't use that language? He was wrong to say that. Definitely not the language that I would use. No. You're talking about yourself. I'm asking you, madam, mister Anderson. Would you please, for the benefit of our listeners, condemn What mister Anderson said. So I think you've done it beautifully. You've explained exactly what the issue is, right, and and exactly what the problem facing Chalkers, which is you bug it if you do and you bug it if you don't. If you go out there and say, He's a racist pig, You've just laid into, the vice chairman of your own party, and you turn and so it's no. It's it's tough. And I think when Labour's in government, they'll find themselves stuck in Same situation. Well, hope hopefully, Keir Starmer won't appoint a Lee Anderson person. You know, it really upsets me. People say Lee Anderson's like Dennis Skinner. Dennis Skinner was a giant compared to Lee Anderson. Well, Lee Anderson's listen, very weird, isn't he? Because he was a big labor counselor. Yes. He was. Yeah. He ran the Constituency office of Gloria del Piero is quite a moderate Labour MP. It's kind of really weird that he's now Flip to being not just a conservative, but a kind of far right conservatives. Converse, Rory. They're often the worst. Now listen. We also it's not just ministers tickers who have to kinda watch what they say, particularly now in in the world of artificial intelligence. Steve the chemist. I think, quotes, amazing, close quotes, is the most banal, overused Oh, what an amazing question. It's an amazing question. It's the most balan and overused word in the English language. So to stop me reporting on the rest is politics 2023 Weekly usage of it, AC 51. Rory Stewart, 127. What single word do you wordsmiths both detest currently and why? Okay. My my big complaint, which I get to a lot when we're doing, international Stuff that are working, particularly in countries in Africa is the way that jargon replaces any description of what's actually going on in a country. So I went through the South Sudan development report and there's no mention of anything real, no mention of any of the names of the warring groups Or issues over oxen or guns or anything like that. Instead, the word governance appears a 150 times. Sustainability You can't like the word governance. Sustainability, 175 times civil society. I mean, and so I actually have developed a real sort of An allergy to to to words like governance, not because I, you know, obviously I like governance, but I think they are amazing how we use those words To say nothing and create create plans for countries which don't allow you to really grip the local particular Real issues on the ground, but just cloak it in words like governance, sustainability, which nobody can disagree with without specifying what they mean. I mean, sustainability can mean Five different things. Mhmm. My, mine is in a similar place. It's stakeholder. Stakeholder. Yeah. Stand that word. Yeah. Stakeholder engagement. And and and then there are certain phrases, getting round the table. Yep. So Priti Patel, when she was my boss, was always using the phrase rolling the pitch. I can never quite work out what she meant, but she would come into every meeting, and she'd say, We're gonna have to roll the pitch here. Oh, and I know what you mean by that. What do you mean by that, Anne? She's she means get the ground ready to do what it is she wants to do. Very good. So for example, it's a cricketing thing where you roll the pitch. Good. Thank you. Well, listen. Talking of sport, Lewis Lampard, No relation to Frank. Do you know who Frank Lampard is, Roy? Yeah. He's a footballer, ain't he? He was. He was. Yeah. He's he's now a sacked manager. Great question this, though. Should there be a referee with VAR in place with power to pause, to fact check statements made by ministers and MPs in parliament and on any news media outlet. Clarity, transparency, better politics, better decisions. The penalty, microphone to the other side for 3 minutes. That's a great idea. Very good. Isn't it? It's fun. I like the microphone to the other side for 3 minutes too. So where can we go? So final question for me. Sign of the times, privatization, good or bad? What are the best examples? What are the worst? So here's obviously, we're in a world which is very, very, sceptical of privatization. We've talked a lot about problems with water privatization, And I I went through with David Gorton, my colleague in the Ministry of Justice, we had to renationalize the privatized probation industry. It was a catastrophic attempt to privatise probation, but there are times when I I could see the point of privatisation. And perhaps the most Striking example for me every day in the House of Commons was the House of Commons coffee shop. So in in the, in podcast house, And and I'm, you know, I'm really sorry for the people working in the coffee shop who are gonna be listening to this and hate me, but you would queue for about 12 minutes to get A really bad cup of coffee, and it was costing, when I looked at the accounts, the House of Commons, an unbelievable amount to run it. The salaries were quite high, and I could totally believe that if Costa or Cafe Nero or Starbucks came in, They would produce a cup of coffee much more quickly. It would be a much better cup of coffee, and they'd probably pay the House of Commons the privilege rather than us losing money on it. I'm not sure that was the kind of privatization that the questioner had in mind. Oh, well, where was there an alternate answer of why privatization can work? Oh, I see where it could work. Yeah. Yeah. Which let's go through the the ones the big ones thus far. Which ones do you think have have worked the least well? Ongoing water. So I think the definition of bad privatization is where there's a natural monopoly, so you can't really get competition, and the obvious ones on that are are rail, Where you just have the rail tracks laid down and water where the costs of creating new water pipes doesn't work. I think it it can work. I think it did work with BT. I think the days when you waited, famous, you know, 9 days to get your telephone installed and was crazy. I think the British automobile industry being run by the government was mad and led to crazy subsidies and crazy forms of Politicians getting jobs, running, all these things. I mean, one of the weird things is that British Leyland and British Coal and British Gas What all became sinocures for retired politicians who were pushed in there by Labour or conservatives putting their cronies in. So I think there were things that That made sense to privatise, but I think it's all about competition firstly and strong regulation. I mean, there's never strong Strong enough regulation to actually make sure these people are doing what they've undertaken to do. Rhonda, my final question. I can't decide between the one about a modern political tickle musical Oh. From Kate Leslie or the one from James Pickering about what do we think about King Charles getting a forty five percent pay rise during a cost of living crisis. So what do you think of the kid getting a 45% pay rise? And how did I predict that? That was absolutely astonishing. I've read that. Well, okay. So, what that really is is that in 2012, I think it was, The government decided that instead of the royal family being paid with votes in parliament from taxation money, Instead, what they were gonna do is say that the royal family could take money from its traditional crown estates And get back to the days when, you know, it wasn't a constitutional monarchy, but monarchs ruled the whole country. There's obviously Huge land holdings that the monarchs had. And so the agreement was that the government would, I think, split the income From the crown estates with the monarchy, the idea of that was to deplest size. It means that you didn't have to have an argument in parliament About exactly how much they were getting every year. But what's happened is that the value of the crown of states has gone up. That means the government's getting more revenue from them, but it also means the royal family's getting more revenue from them. And it's been a particularly good year for the Crown Estates because there's been, a lot of construction, I think, on some of the off tour sites that they own. I thought you were going to say that this is what I'm going to say Yep. Is that, you know, he's had a massive promotion. He's gone from being, you know, a mere prince of Wales to being the king. So he's bound to get a pay rise. Also, Roy, I have to tell you, did you know I mean, you know the guy a lot better than I do, but did you know that he actually identifies as a Burnley fan? He does not. He's a Burnley fan. He does. He's a he and I can send you and we should put in the newsletter. I can send you the picture of him holding a Burnley shirt, and it's because The Prince's Trust has done an awful lot of stuff up in what's known as the Weavers' Triangle in Burnley. So he does identify as a Burnley fan. Well, so here's here's the actual way that this all works. So there's something called the sovereign grant, and it is 15% of the income account net surplus of the crown estate for the financial a year that began 2 years previously. That was quick word by the Buckingham Palace press office. How did they get that just straight away? Pretty pretty quick. And it and it goes up and down. So, you know, some years it drops, some years it goes up. And at the moment it's higher because they got A concession to take 25% for a limited period for renovation and repairs to Buckingham Palace. But it is still much, much, much cheaper than, presidents around the world. So almost every time people try to measure this, Work out how much a head of state costs. Generally, the British monarchy is considered a bit of a bargain. Although, of course, it does, I understand sometimes frustrates some of our listeners. I I am obviously largely a conservative because I am a huge admirer of the king I'm a great believer in the British monarchy, but part of that is an emotional, romantic nostalgia. We we we know that. Well, I do I do like the fact that he that he identifies as a Burnley fan. And, also, Rory, I'm sure you have some friends, and I have some friends who Send you messages literally about every single episode. Do you have friends like that? Yeah. One of the one of the ones that does that to me is Malcolm McKay, He's the manager of Ross County. And amid his message this week was a picture of himself with the king at the Port of Nig. Very good. You know where the Port of Nig is? It's one of Scotland's most important energy industry facilities, and there was the king up there, meeting the people, including the manager of Ross County. Just to finish on, so I one of the things that is amazing is how Incredible I found it in Cumbria that when David Cameron would come to visit, almost nobody would come out in the streets to meet him. But when, and I'm afraid probably the same would be true of Keir Starmer, but when the king or then the prince of Wales turned up in which was a town of about 5,000 people. There must have been 7,000 people in the streets in driving Cumbrian rain for an hour and a half, Standing there waiting. And he really took the time to go around talking to a very, very large number of those people. And he's doing sort of, I mean, I don't really still notice this. In those days, in Cumbria, he would do, I think, 11 meetings in a day, wouldn't stop for lunch. He probably would meet, I don't know. Thousands of people have a conversation with them. I don't know how he found the energy to do that. I think he genuinely enjoys it. He really likes Meeting people. But it was a reminder of the fact that politicians don't have that level of enthusiasm or support in the way that I felt that he did, at least in Cumbria. You know, maybe they one of the functions of the royal family is to have that because I mentioned the Arnold Schwarzenegger documentary series that I watched. Funny enough, when he was out and about, he he did get that sort of turnout in different places that he went to, and I guess Trump does. We We mentioned Zimbabwe in the main podcast. Honestly, looking at the size of some of the rallies, absolutely unbelievable. You know, 200,000 people turning out. So I think it depends. I think it's part of the British sort of, oh god, here they come sort of mood that attaches itself to politicians. Rory, next time we go to Scotland together, though, we're going to you know, we've got several 1,000 coming to see us. Yep. Yep. Absolutely. And the Albert Hall Yeah. All ended this year. Looking forward to that very much. Exactly. And as Unlike unlike Yovil No Harari, who we're just gonna plug as we come to the end because we've got a second interview with him, He has managed to do what we have not done, which is sell out the o two. Oh, we haven't tried. Oh, there we are. And, also, we did sell it. We sold it out for Anthony Joshua, which we we all join to Joshua, and the rest is politics leading. And lo and behold, even though he wasn't even fighting the guy he was meant to be fighting, o two packed out. Any anyone interested in finding out why a young, Israeli historian, scientist and philosopher Can pack out the entire o two arena, listen to our leading podcast, out this week, 2nd podcast interview on the life, the universe, and everything with Yovelle Noah Harari. Alright, Roy. That's it for this week. Speak to you very, very soon. Speak soon.",

And, Alastair, you have a very, very splendid shirt on. I have my what you call my Penrith Veth shirts on, but you have something which looks more like sort of Saturday Night Live.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's a car driving across my chest.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm already into cars. Fiona has this sort of desire, I think, for me to be a man that I'm not. Oh. So she regularly will go out and buy me shirts like this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's interesting because you definitely have a desire for me to be a man that I'm not. So I I I think that you're obviously passing on.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory, I I have no desire over you. You do have a perpetual\n\nSpeaker 1: desire for me to be a football loving, beer drinking dude?\n\nSpeaker 0: Can you remember the name of the Bulgarian detached law footballer?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Sadly not. Come on. What's his name again?\n\nSpeaker 0: Kostadidov. Listen. Let's get a a couple of quick easy ones out of the way to start with. Okay? I'm going to reward some perseverance.\n\nMichael Rees, question attempt number 18. And I've checked. He has asked this question 18 times. So stop whinging all you people who say I've asked Question 8 times, 9 times, 10 times. Michael Rees' question is quite simple, Rory.\n\nWill we go to Cardiff to do a show in 2024? Wales is the only nation in the UK that we've not hosted a show yet.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll definitely go to Wales, and Cardiff sounds like a good spot. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, there doesn't have to be Cardiff. I think we've gotta be, you know, I, by the way, Michael, have been to Wales at least 3 times in the last few months. And here's another very quick snappy one we can do, Roy. Cheeong Ra MP.\n\nFew people have got in touch to say on a recent podcast, you couldn't think of any MPs with a scientific background, so I thought I'd send you a link to the BBC's live Scientific episode That Coven Mine. So there you go. We'll put that in the, in the newsletter.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like to pay tribute to Chee. So Chee Did a lot with me in the early days on mobile coverage and broadband. And absolutely she is a person with a serious scientific background in parliament, As, of course, as I've pointed out, is Therese Coffey, who's got a doctorate in strange bits of biochemistry.\n\nSpeaker 0: And who whose name keeps appearing in stories about the pending reshuffle. Hey ho. Now let's have a couple here on education, even though the first one from Kate Grant is only the 8th time that she's asked it. Kate from Buxton, over 20% of secondary age young people have been persistently absent from school this year, and the suspension rate is 49% higher in 2020 2, that in 2017, is the education system in England fundamentally broken? If so, how can it be fixed?\n\nKath, given the growing rates of absences in our schools, is our education system fit for purpose anymore? And should educators rather than politicians not be at the forefront of a front of a complete overhaul. Why aren't labor being bolder in their education policy as currently, it seems to be more of the same?\n\nSpeaker 1: So what what do you think accounts for the growing absences from school? What's What's going on there?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think a lot of it is COVID. I think it's children who got used to not going to school and then found it hard to go back. But, actually, if I can Plug an excellent piece, which answers partly answers both questions from somebody I think you probably miss her actually, Rory, somebody called Fiona Miller, who's a a writer and a journalist specializing in education and parenting issues.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's right. Fiona Miller. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: You've heard of Fiona Miller? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've heard of her. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I've I know her very, very well. Well, she's a mother of my 3 children.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes, exactly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Anyway, we should put in the newsletter a piece she wrote in The Guardian which does try to answer this question. And I think the final point is Partly because of some of the things that Michael Gove, in his wisdom, undid that the Labour government had put in place. A lot of the support that's there for teachers has gone, And a lot of the outside school support has gone. I saw your friend Jillian Keegan recently said that teachers should sort of you know, if kids aren't turning up, the Schools should go and find them and all of them back in. But, of course, the schools are pretty overwhelmed as it is.\n\nSo I think there's a whole load of things that were taken away that have not been replaced, and the the schools are operating at full pelt, and they're just not able to keep up with some of these kids who are not there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gosh. I was also reading, actually, the US Department of Education struggling with the same thing. They've got about 16% absenteeism, and they're people with non native English much more likely to be absent, people with disabilities much more like be absent. I mean, it is such a problem. Shoshanna taught in very difficult schools, both in Harlem and in Boston, And there, they they did literally go to people's homes to try to find children and bring them in.\n\nAnd as you say, it's incredibly time consuming. I mean, it it it's sort of half broke. The teacher's trying to stay on top of that.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I do think the point of of labor and we talked in the main podcast about the government being behind on on the NHS. I do think that education. I really like Bridget Phillips, And I think she'd be a terrific secretary of state. But I think within the public debate, partly, I think, because the current education secretary, Gillian Keegan, is, I think, pretty low profile and doesn't Say much about education is it's just vanished from the debate. It's not at the center of our debate about what sort of future we want as a country.\n\nAnd, of course, we're going in, you know, in the next couple of weeks, we're gonna get a levels. We're gonna get GCSE results. And we're going to get them at a point Where you've had kids who've had the whole COVID experience is bad enough, and then now you also you've had the teacher strikes as some of the marking issues have not been resolved. You're gonna have all sorts of kids not getting downgraded because of some of the changes that have been made in the marketing systems. And I just think these are things that because they're not if I may revisit one of my my central scenes, because so many of our leading journalists and editors use private schools.\n\nI don't think they focus on education nearly as much as they should. And I think that that is another reason why the politicians don't focus on it as much as they should either.\n\nSpeaker 1: So here's a couple of questions, I think. Sam Calvert Smith, a while ago, you pledged to do a good news only episode. I realize it's almost impossible at the moment, but wondered if between you, you could find any good news that we are asked to come with some good news for us.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, look, one person's the definition of news that was one of the greatest definitions of of news ever, news is something that somebody, somewhere doesn't want to see printed. Right? So I would argue that it's good news that Donald Trump has been indicted again. Right? But it's bad news for Donald Trump.\n\nBut I you know, we talked the other day about there's a serious point to this because we talked recently about the the the Canadian legislation where they're changing The the arrangements with Meta and Google and what have you. And when we were looking into that, I came across this piece on The Conversation, which had some figures. I think it for the UK, it was 46 ticks. Percent of people who now deliberately avoid the news, and that's massive.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's it's unbelievable, and it's it's fatal for politics because Yeah. Politics are the center of the news, And obviously democracy depends on informed citizens and holding people accountable. And once almost half your population is actively refusing to visit these. How on earth are you supposed to hold politicians accountable? Yeah.\n\nSo here's a good bit of news for you. Scientists have found a naturally occurring strain of bacteria which can Stop transmission malaria.\n\nSpeaker 0: That is good news.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's quite exciting. So they went and looked at the 2014 experiment, Went back and looked at it again, and they think that this may be a real breakthrough. And, of course, malaria still kills 600,000 people Every year. So there we are. There's something a little bit of good news for you.\n\nGenerally, if you go on the BBC, BBC's got uplifting news, but most of it tends to be about Teddy bears stuck on the top of mountains or rescuing dolphins and dogs. Or\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Listen. I try to defend the BBC. The BBC's online top Ten stories is becoming absurd and ridiculous at times. The BBC is a serious news organization.\n\nCan they please focus on serious news? Thank you very much. Over and out. Right. Dan Taylor, I'm enjoying reading Rory's book about the Scottish Borders' walks with his dad.\n\nI love the reference to his dad saying, Archimedes, every time tea is poured. Why is this Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: And then he follows up. For Alastair, if you've been brought up by Rory's father, can you imagine how your worldview might differ? And do you think you would gravitated to being a Tory? Okay. Let me try Archimedes, and then we'll throw this thing.\n\nSo my father was completely I I think you would have enjoyed meeting him. He was born in 1920 To he fought in the war, he became an intelligence officer. He was trained to land in small submarines off the coast of Borneo during confrontation with Sukarno. He was A passionate Scott. He was very close to his brother, which is 2 little boys.\n\nTheir father was in India. My grandfather was in India. And these 2 little boys, Grew up in Kirimira and Angus and then went off to war together, and his brother, who was just a year old and him, was killed fighting with the Black Watch in Sicily. And my father never really, I think, Develop close male friends again after that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh wow. Is that why you joined the Black Watch, by the way?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. My father, my uncle, my grandfather, my great grandfather, yeah. My father was so proud of being Scottish and kind of petulantly and childishly anti English at almost every opportunity he was given.\n\nSpeaker 0: Would he want Australia to beat England in the world the Women's World Cup semifinal tomorrow?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think he'd be quite amused by that sort of thing. But his sort of Scottishness was much more about he loved trying to improve his Gaelic, he Love playing his chanter. He was very interested in Scottish music, Scottish place names he was very interested in. I mean, he'd wear tartan trues in Vietnam to To give a sort of sense of kind of how what a sort of campaigning Scotty was. Anyway, the Archimedes' point is that he was terrified about the fact that when you pour a teapot, He worried that the lids are going to fall off the teapot, and Archimedes was some sort of way of him talking about the leverage problems.\n\nHe actually basically felt the entire family were really messy and And all we were ever gonna do was pour tea all over the place. And as a result, his mother-in-law was so terrified by him that every time he came to visit her, she'd just pour tea everywhere.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. The bid for me, if I had been brought up by your father, can I imagine that my worldview might differ? Yes. Do I think I would therefore have gravitated to being a Tory. Definitely not.\n\nAbsolutely not. It would have made me even more labor. I I must tell you, Roy, I wasn't gonna tell you this until I saw you face to face, but I am carrying with me, because you have a significant birthday coming up\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: A book written by the man in the foreign service who followed your dad in Hanoi. Oh. But unlike your dad, He traveled with a really, really high quality camera and took some amazing photographs and has published a rather beautiful book about his time in Hanoi there just after your dad left. So there you go. So I've got a copy of that book for you, which I shall be presenting to you from my friend, John Ramsden, tickers.\n\nOn your significant birthday, there you are. Freddie Jewett, what is your view on Dominic Cummings' start up t, brackets, c sub stack, brackets. Where is he right wrong? On the problems with the status quo party and white hall setups, focus on media rather than voters, Systems thinking approach to policies and government, lack of, I imagine, and the key problems and policy areas for the UK. Now I I haven't read Dominic Cubbing's Peace on Substack.\n\nBut if he's saying that there should be a new start up party or that if there is one, it should focus on the problems with the status quo party, white all setups, focus on media, not voters, systems thinking approach, etcetera. And I know these are things that he's banged on about for some time. And I think although I come at it from a very, very different political perspective to his. I do think there is something fundamentally wrong with our politics, and I think it's partly what gave us Brexit. I think it's partly what's given us this succession of, I think, pretty useless prime ministers.\n\nAnd it's partly what's making people frustrated that the Labour Party is not sort of coming in with that sense of real change and radical change that the country's crying out for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So Cummings and Cummings are really interesting character. I think he's a he has actually done a lot of harm. I think him endorsing and getting behind Boris Johnson was Terrible, because I think Boris Johnson was a terrible, terrible prime minister, and Dominic Cummings enabled him and should bear responsibility for that. And it's no good him them saying, Now that he's left, the guy's like a shopping trolley careering around.\n\nHe should've known that in advance, and he shouldn't have enabled that. But, of course, what he is good at is the negative critique bit. I don't think He's actually very good at positively running the country, but his critique, which he put in a substack, I think you'd agree with a lot of. He says that Rishi Sunak is diligent, but is mostly dealing with second order issues. And this then is his criticism.\n\nHe says there's no grip of power. He says the Cabinet Office is a dumpster fire. There's no governing plan for the NHS, crime, the war, productivity, growth, r and d, or anything else. No message, no serious polling communications or political machine, no political strategy worth spit, a humiliating Awful level of argument on every major issue reduced to defending idiot MPs and political disintegration. So as with a lot of these people, I think he's got Clear eyed analysis of what's wrong, but I don't think that means that I want Dominic Cummings in running the country again.\n\nHere we are. Question on Ecuador from Louise Barrett. Interested to hear more on your thoughts of what's gone on in Ecuador. Hadn't realized how fractious it was there. Any insight is welcome.\n\nSo very quickly on that one for listeners. Ecuador has had a horrible, horrifying explosion of drug violence. In fact, one of the things that's been happening across Central Latin America has been an explosion from old centers in Colombia and Mexico, partly to do with the disintegration of Venezuela, of criminal drug gangs right the way across the continent. And this has resulted in Ecuador in these moments of political violence. And the leading anti corruption campaigner in the presidential election being killed, and now another major local politician being assassinated in the lead up to the election.\n\nSpeaker 0: And now even as we're speaking, a third, somebody called Pedro Brillonis, who was an organizer for citizen revolution, that's literally just been announced. So, I mean, it does sort of bring home as well that there are parts of the world I mean, we've had political assassinations, Joe Cox, David Amess. But I think for people to be out on the campaign stump as they are now and, clearly, The sense is that the 1st guy who was murdered, Fernando Villavista Vicencio, he has been very, very vocal Speaking out against corruption, against the drug gangs, and and so forth. And, you know, the suspicion is that they're the ones who wiped him out. So it's a classic kind of, you know, mafia style silencing operation.\n\nSpeaker 1: And a reminder how quickly things can change in the modern world because Ecuador, you would have said a decade ago Yeah. Was A pretty stable, peaceful place and it's just in the last 5 years that it's basically become like Colombia in the 90s. And there are whole bits So the country now controlled by these criminal drug gangs. So it's a real reminder of how fragile countries and politics can be that the kind of assumptions that you would have had 5, 6 years ago can be turned on their heads so rapidly the way these international criminal gangs can just destroy a state.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I didn't I'm I can't claim to you on this. But you may know more than I do. But is it not the case that Ecuador doesn't have its own drug trade as such, but it's sandwiched between Colombia and Peru, and therefore is essential to their kinda roots, the trafficking groups.\n\nSpeaker 1: Next question. Tony Blair Institute, a force for good. Ralfi, is the Blair Institute for Global Change, a force Good. Hugo Almond, having read the news about Tony Blair and his Saudi connections, wouldn't it be wise for Keir Starmer to keep as much distance as possible From this heavily tainted predecessor, that's a slightly unfair question to you because, obviously, Tony Blair is somebody you admire immensely.\n\nSpeaker 0: Somebody somebody you admire immensely as well, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd also like Tony Blair very much. But there's been some very interesting reporting, which I think would be fair for us to report on, which has Been getting into the funding and the way in which it's funded by Larry Ellison and some of the different ways in which the money is generated. There was a Really interesting detailed article written by Tom McTague. Tom McTague is a a really interesting long form journalist who did some really good reporting on Long Island, Did a very interesting profile of Boris Johnson, was a correspondent with The Atlantic and has spent the last few weeks getting into real detail on the on the funding of the Tony Blair Institute. So I think it's it's worth reading.\n\nI mean, it's a very interesting account. I don't think I came out of it feeling that Tony Blair was guilty of great wrongdoing, But it it is an interesting example of some of the perils of how you fund yourself and what happens when you have to try to raise tens of 1,000,000 of dollars a year, often in his case for good tickets. He's using this money to do a lot of support for governance work and delivery work in developing countries around the world, but an interesting long form piece.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I've not read it. I was vaguely aware of the stories because I was getting phone calls from journalists asking if I wanted to say anything about them, and and I didn't. But as you raise as you raise on the podcast, I will. No. I I think that Tony left office in 2007.\n\nAnd I think he struggled for a while to establish exactly how he was going to kind of operate. I think he has now found his feet, and he runs this organization, which I think is a force for good. I think it's a force for good in the way that it contributes It's a public policy debate. I think it's a force for good as you say in some of the work that it does in some of the poorest parts of the world. I mean, Tony's Institute is operating in dozens of countries now and doing it in a way that I think is, You know, he he he with some of the work he's done in Africa has won a lot of praise from some of the organizations.\n\nHe said that even some of the big charities were pulling out to some of the poorest places in the world. And I think what happened in the in the early years is that he he stopped being a politician in a way. He stopped explaining who he was and what he did, which which is part of what a modern politician has to do. And I think he's doing that more now, and I think it is giving people a better sense of of what he does. Now I don't know what canations he has with Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nI don't know what canations he has with with Saudis in terms of any financing. I just don't know. But I do know That he raises a lot of money in part to fund these projects and also in part to hire the people that he work that work for him. And he's now hiring Several 100 people, including people I keep saying to saying to people in around Giers Tharman, never mind Giers having a relationship with them. Hire some of these people because you've got some of the smartest people currently working in policy work going.\n\nSpeaker 1: Clare McCord, would love to hear your thoughts on the PSNI, Police service law null and data breach, particularly as I feel the seriousness of this may not be quite understood in the rest of the UK. Yep. In an age of constant breach that leaks people data. So Take it back then to end of February. John Caldwell, he's a detective chief inspector, is coaching some kids.\n\nHe's leaning into the back of his car to put his footballs away And he is then shot from behind by 2 gunmen and ends up in hospital. And it's a reminder of the risk. And off the back of this, there's now been a data leak where the names and the stations of, I think almost every police officer in the police service in Northern Ireland.\n\nSpeaker 0: Under roles, crucially. So for example, you've got people who's, you know, role liaison with the security service, for example. You know, there's some pretty serious stuff there. And and the PSNI chief constable Simon Byrne, who's a very fine man, he has Been open about the fact, he says, they're now confident that dissident Republicans do have possession of this stuff. So, I mean, it's really, really alarming and really quite scary for a lot of people, this.\n\nSpeaker 1: And a reminder for all of us, I mean, it's incredibly, unfortunately, easy for this to happen, and we are so dependent, obviously, on data and IT, and it's complicated. I mean, I'm running a big charity at the moment where we're dealing with data in 14 different countries, and Every time you upgrade or move to a new system, there are going to be other forms of cyber challenges and backdoors. And Staying on top of this stuff is vital, particularly though for governments and particularly for something as sensitive as the police service in Northern Ireland. So I can't really understand how this happened, but I think it's Reminder for anyone listening that this stuff can happen so easily and does.\n\nSpeaker 0: And also, I don't think most people, when we're, You know? And I'm as bad I'm as guilty as anybody. But when when we're sort of, you know, just working on our computer and you're sitting there and it says accept this, decline that, Agree to this, not agree to that. I don't think we really think through what we're doing with that stuff, but this is clearly some sort of cyberattack. But the document had the names of around 10,000 office and staff.\n\nIt had their surname, first initial, rank or grade, where they were based and the unit they work in and the responsibilities that they had. So that's a lot of information. And as you said earlier, John Caldwell, You know, they they obviously had the intelligence. They knew that that's what he did in his spare time. He coached kids' football.\n\nNow That's the sort of thing that you can probably find out anyway. But if you if you are wanting to target police officers, then having the information that they now have is It's pretty alarming.\n\nSpeaker 1: And terrifying obviously if you are a police officer in Orlando. I mean if you every time you go coaching football and are leaning into the back of your car to put the footballs away, you think 2 people are going to come up and shoot from behind. Your life becomes impossible. So here's a question for you. Jonah Woodward, what are your thoughts on the recent UFO congressional hearing in the US?\n\nSpeaker 0: I didn't know there was 1. Did you know there was 1?\n\nSpeaker 1: I I did, actually. I've been following I mean, it's it's the sort of thing that gets people very excited on social media.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is probably going to make every conspiracy theorist in the world think that I just don't like conspiracy theories, and I go over the top. But every time I see anything to do with UFOs and congressional inquiries. Am I wrong just to sort of turn off?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you're absolutely right. There's been some wonderful graphs Almost all the UFOs spotted in the world have been spotted from the United States or Britain because clearly aliens are English speaking people. But then there's a town called which I I think maybe I talked about it before. There's a town called Bonnybridge, which is in the central belt in Scotland. Anyway, it's right next to Falkirk, so it's called the Falkirk Triangle.\n\nMy friends Luke and Will went down there because they were really excited because they had 300 UFO Opting for the year, and they were really, really excited to go down there and see a UFO. And then a bit disappointed to discover that I think out of the 300 sightings, 298 have been made by the same man.\n\nSpeaker 0: So you have close friends who believe all this stuff?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I don't I I don't know whether Will and Luke really believed it. I think Maybe their idea of a their sense of humor going down. But I\n\nSpeaker 0: have to say, Falkirk played a very, very important part in my life. Oh, yeah? Because it was there in 1986 at the Falkirk Labour Club that I was drunk for the last time in my life.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, very good. Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very good. Well, that's true. That's prom one of the many, many reasons to love the Labour Party, Roy.\n\nSpeaker 1: But why why was that the last Time in your life, you behaved so badly that that was a turning point for you?\n\nSpeaker 0: That was when I about 3 hours later, I was arrested, and then I was locked And then I was taken to hospital, and then I was advised that, you know, this drinking at this level wasn't really very good for you. So good old Falkirk, I said.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well done, Falkirk. So, Anaset, let's take a break.\n\nSpeaker 0: I had one for you. You be you've been throwing questions at me deliberately provocative. Yeah. Matt, Rory spoke very highly of Alec's Chalk when he took over as justice secretary. What did he make there for of Alex Chalk's defense of Lee Anderson's comments on migrants?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, obviously makes me a little bit uncomfortable. I think Alex Chalk, Cheltenham MP, he's very bright. He was a stalwart On Brexit, he he really worked hard to try to get a decent compromised Brexit deal together with me. He Push for customs union, I'm very proud he's justice secretary. I'm obviously disappointed by that.\n\nI think it's worth though bearing in mind, as somebody who It's been through the mill on this, and as you have too, that one of the problems is that you end up defending your party right or wrong, and it's very difficult for outsiders You quite appreciate the pressures that you're always under in a government to defend your colleagues, and I think, You know, I would try to find a way of sort of defending a little bit half heartedly and not getting out there, but it it's a tribal game, isn't it? It's a very tribal game.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's say it had been you. You're the minister being sent out by Downing Street's spin doctors to defend everything the government says and does. Surely you, a civilized, reasonable, rational, well educated man, cannot possibly defend the comments of Lee Anderson. They're all over the papers this morning, which he told these poor bedraggle people getting on the Bibby Stockholm to fuck off back to France if they don't like it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I Al Simon, thank you for the, the the the compliments towards what a civilized man I am. Obviously, I Wouldn't use that kinda language, but there is a serious issue here, which is the issue around whether or not France is a safe country.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. You wouldn't use that language? He was wrong to say that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Definitely not the language that I would use.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. You're talking about yourself. I'm asking you, madam, mister Anderson. Would you please, for the benefit of our listeners, condemn What mister Anderson said.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think you've done it beautifully. You've explained exactly what the issue is, right, and and exactly what the problem facing Chalkers, which is you bug it if you do and you bug it if you don't. If you go out there and say, He's a racist pig, You've just laid into, the vice chairman of your own party, and you turn and so it's no. It's it's tough. And I think when Labour's in government, they'll find themselves stuck in Same situation.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, hope hopefully, Keir Starmer won't appoint a Lee Anderson person. You know, it really upsets me. People say Lee Anderson's like Dennis Skinner. Dennis Skinner was a giant compared to Lee Anderson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Lee Anderson's listen, very weird, isn't he? Because he was a big labor counselor.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. He was. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: He ran the Constituency office of Gloria del Piero is quite a moderate Labour MP. It's kind of really weird that he's now Flip to being\n\nSpeaker 0: not just\n\nSpeaker 1: a conservative, but a kind of far right conservatives.\n\nSpeaker 0: Converse, Rory. They're often the worst. Now listen. We also it's not just ministers tickers who have to kinda watch what they say, particularly now in in the world of artificial intelligence. Steve the chemist.\n\nI think, quotes, amazing, close quotes, is the most banal, overused\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, what an amazing question. It's an amazing question.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's the most balan and overused word in the English language. So to stop me reporting on the rest is politics 2023 Weekly usage of it, AC 51. Rory Stewart, 127. What single word do you wordsmiths both detest currently and why?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. My my big complaint, which I get to a lot when we're doing, international Stuff that are working, particularly in countries in Africa is the way that jargon replaces any description of what's actually going on in a country. So I went through the South Sudan development report and there's no mention of anything real, no mention of any of the names of the warring groups Or issues over oxen or guns or anything like that. Instead, the word governance appears a 150 times. Sustainability You\n\nSpeaker 0: can't like the word governance.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sustainability, 175 times civil society. I mean, and so I actually have developed a real sort of An allergy to to to words like governance, not because I, you know, obviously I like governance, but I think they are amazing how we use those words To say nothing and create create plans for countries which don't allow you to really grip the local particular Real issues on the ground, but just cloak it in words like governance, sustainability, which nobody can disagree with without specifying what they mean. I mean, sustainability can mean Five different things.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. My, mine is in a similar place. It's stakeholder. Stakeholder. Yeah.\n\nStand that word.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Stakeholder engagement.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and and then there are certain phrases, getting round the table.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. So Priti Patel, when she was my boss, was always using the phrase rolling the pitch. I can never quite work out what she meant, but she would come into every meeting, and she'd say, We're gonna have to roll the pitch here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, and I know what you mean by that. What do\n\nSpeaker 1: you mean by that, Anne?\n\nSpeaker 0: She's she means get the ground ready to do what it is she wants to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: So for example, it's a cricketing thing where you roll the pitch. Good. Thank you. Well, listen. Talking of sport, Lewis Lampard, No relation to Frank.\n\nDo you know who Frank Lampard is, Roy?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. He's a footballer, ain't he?\n\nSpeaker 0: He was. He was. Yeah. He's he's now a sacked manager. Great question this, though.\n\nShould there be a referee with VAR in place with power to pause, to fact check statements made by ministers and MPs in parliament and on any news media outlet. Clarity, transparency, better politics, better decisions. The penalty, microphone to the other side for 3 minutes. That's a great idea.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's fun. I like the microphone to the other side for 3 minutes too. So where can we go? So final question for me. Sign of the times, privatization, good or bad?\n\nWhat are the best examples? What are the worst? So here's obviously, we're in a world which is very, very, sceptical of privatization. We've talked a lot about problems with water privatization, And I I went through with David Gorton, my colleague in the Ministry of Justice, we had to renationalize the privatized probation industry. It was a catastrophic attempt to privatise probation, but there are times when I I could see the point of privatisation.\n\nAnd perhaps the most Striking example for me every day in the House of Commons was the House of Commons coffee shop. So in in the, in podcast house, And and I'm, you know, I'm really sorry for the people working in the coffee shop who are gonna be listening to this and hate me, but you would queue for about 12 minutes to get A really bad cup of coffee, and it was costing, when I looked at the accounts, the House of Commons, an unbelievable amount to run it. The salaries were quite high, and I could totally believe that if Costa or Cafe Nero or Starbucks came in, They would produce a cup of coffee much more quickly. It would be a much better cup of coffee, and they'd probably pay the House of Commons the privilege rather than us losing money on it.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm not sure that was the kind of privatization that the questioner had in mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, well, where was there an alternate answer of why privatization can work?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I see where it could work. Yeah. Yeah. Which let's go through the the ones the big ones thus far. Which ones do you think have have worked the least well?\n\nOngoing water.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think the definition of bad privatization is where there's a natural monopoly, so you can't really get competition, and the obvious ones on that are are rail, Where you just have the rail tracks laid down and water where the costs of creating new water pipes doesn't work. I think it it can work. I think it did work with BT. I think the days when you waited, famous, you know, 9 days to get your telephone installed and was crazy. I think the British automobile industry being run by the government was mad and led to crazy subsidies and crazy forms of Politicians getting jobs, running, all these things.\n\nI mean, one of the weird things is that British Leyland and British Coal and British Gas What all became sinocures for retired politicians who were pushed in there by Labour or conservatives putting their cronies in.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I\n\nSpeaker 1: think there were things that That made sense to privatise, but I think it's all about competition firstly and strong regulation. I mean, there's never strong Strong enough regulation to actually make sure these people are doing what they've undertaken to do.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rhonda, my final question. I can't decide between the one about a modern political tickle musical Oh. From Kate Leslie or the one from James Pickering about what do we think about King Charles getting a forty five percent pay rise during a cost of living crisis. So what do you think of the kid getting a 45% pay rise?\n\nSpeaker 1: And how did I predict that? That was absolutely astonishing. I've read that. Well, okay. So, what that really is is that in 2012, I think it was, The government decided that instead of the royal family being paid with votes in parliament from taxation money, Instead, what they were gonna do is say that the royal family could take money from its traditional crown estates And get back to the days when, you know, it wasn't a constitutional monarchy, but monarchs ruled the whole country.\n\nThere's obviously Huge land holdings that the monarchs had. And so the agreement was that the government would, I think, split the income From the crown estates with the monarchy, the idea of that was to deplest size. It means that you didn't have to have an argument in parliament About exactly how much they were getting every year. But what's happened is that the value of the crown of states has gone up. That means the government's getting more revenue from them, but it also means the royal family's getting more revenue from them.\n\nAnd it's been a particularly good year for the Crown Estates because there's been, a lot of construction, I think, on some of the off tour sites that they own.\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought you were going to say that this is what I'm going to say Yep. Is that, you know, he's had a massive promotion. He's gone from being, you know, a mere prince of Wales to being the king. So he's bound to get a pay rise. Also, Roy, I have to tell you, did you know I mean, you know the guy a lot better than I do, but did you know that he actually identifies as a Burnley fan?\n\nHe does not. He's a Burnley fan. He does. He's a he and I can send you and we should put in the newsletter. I can send you the picture of him holding a Burnley shirt, and it's because The Prince's Trust has done an awful lot of stuff up in what's known as the Weavers' Triangle in Burnley.\n\nSo he does identify as a Burnley fan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so here's here's the actual way that this all works. So there's something called the sovereign grant, and it is 15% of the income account net surplus of the crown estate for the financial a year that began 2 years previously.\n\nSpeaker 0: That was quick word by the Buckingham Palace press office. How did they get that just straight away?\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty pretty quick. And it and it goes up and down. So, you know, some years it drops, some years it goes up. And at the moment it's higher because they got A concession to take 25% for a limited period for renovation and repairs to Buckingham Palace. But it is still much, much, much cheaper than, presidents around the world.\n\nSo almost every time people try to measure this, Work out how much a head of state costs. Generally, the British monarchy is considered a bit of a bargain. Although, of course, it does, I understand sometimes frustrates some of our listeners. I I am obviously largely a conservative because I am a huge admirer of the king I'm a great believer in the British monarchy, but part of that is an emotional, romantic nostalgia.\n\nSpeaker 0: We we we know that. Well, I do I do like the fact that he that he identifies as a Burnley fan. And, also, Rory, I'm sure you have some friends, and I have some friends who Send you messages literally about every single episode. Do you have friends like that? Yeah.\n\nOne of the one of the ones that does that to me is Malcolm McKay, He's the manager of Ross County. And amid his message this week was a picture of himself with the king at the Port of Nig. Very good. You know where the Port of Nig is? It's one of Scotland's most important energy industry facilities, and there was the king up there, meeting the people, including the manager of Ross County.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just to finish on, so I one of the things that is amazing is how Incredible I found it in Cumbria that when David Cameron would come to visit, almost nobody would come out in the streets to meet him. But when, and I'm afraid probably the same would be true of Keir Starmer, but when the king or then the prince of Wales turned up in which was a town of about 5,000 people. There must have been 7,000 people in the streets in driving Cumbrian rain for an hour and a half, Standing there waiting. And he really took the time to go around talking to a very, very large number of those people. And he's doing sort of, I mean, I don't really still notice this.\n\nIn those days, in Cumbria, he would do, I think, 11 meetings in a day, wouldn't stop for lunch. He probably would meet, I don't know. Thousands of people have a conversation with them. I don't know how he found the energy to do that. I think he genuinely enjoys it.\n\nHe really likes Meeting people. But it was a reminder of the fact that politicians don't have that level of enthusiasm or support in the way that I felt that he did, at least in Cumbria.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know, maybe they one of the functions of the royal family is to have that because I mentioned the Arnold Schwarzenegger documentary series that I watched. Funny enough, when he was out and about, he he did get that sort of turnout in different places that he went to, and I guess Trump does. We We mentioned Zimbabwe in the main podcast. Honestly, looking at the size of some of the rallies, absolutely unbelievable. You know, 200,000 people turning out.\n\nSo I think it depends. I think it's part of the British sort of, oh god, here they come sort of mood that attaches itself to politicians. Rory, next time we go to Scotland together, though, we're going to you know, we've got several 1,000 coming to see us.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Yep. Absolutely. And the Albert Hall Yeah. All ended this year.\n\nLooking forward to that very much.\n\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. And as\n\nSpeaker 1: Unlike unlike Yovil No Harari, who we're just gonna plug as we come to the end because we've got a second interview with him, He has managed to do what we have not done, which is sell out the o two.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, we haven't tried.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, there we are.\n\nSpeaker 0: And, also, we did sell it. We sold it out for Anthony Joshua, which we we all join to Joshua, and the rest is politics leading. And lo and behold, even though he wasn't even fighting the guy he was meant to be fighting, o two packed out.\n\nSpeaker 1: Any anyone interested in finding out why a young, Israeli historian, scientist and philosopher Can pack out the entire o two arena, listen to our leading podcast, out this week, 2nd podcast interview on the life, the universe, and everything with Yovelle Noah Harari.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright, Roy. That's it for this week. Speak to you very, very soon.\n\nSpeaker 1: Speak soon.",
