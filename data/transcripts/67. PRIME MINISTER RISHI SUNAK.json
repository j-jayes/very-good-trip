Welcome to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And, Alsair, you're you're still in France, and I am still in Africa, with which a big apology, please, to listeners because we're recording this On Monday afternoon, I have left my family. We are we're very, very lucky. We're on a safari in Kenya, And we've been looking at wonderful animals with a 5 year old and a 7 year old, but I've left them for 3 hours to try to find my way to an Internet connection to record this. But that means that we are recording At a time when it's still not clear exactly what's happening to serve his leadership, but it my guess is, and I'm betting hard on this. And, please, You know, I'll be humiliated if I'm not right that Rishi Sunak is going to be the only one who will cross a 100 backers, which just means Rishi Sunak will be our next prime minister, and I'm gonna record on that basis. And if I'm wrong, you can all laugh at me. Well, you wouldn't I mean, I think that would be harsh to laugh at you, Rory. I think we'll be I I will be, just reflecting on the fact that we will now have had 5 conservative prime ministers in 6 years, it really is the sort of thing we used to laugh at Italy for. So we've gone Cameron, May, Johnson, Truss, and now Rishi Sunak. And We had that sort of convulsion at the weekend as the attention seeker in chief and the charlatan in chief decided that what the country needed was for Him to come back and, expose us to more lies and law breaking, no doubt. That's gone. I Expect that his statement I don't know how many untruths there would have been in his statement last night that he'd got over the limit, but decided It was it was infuriating. Can can we just cut in on that just for our listeners readers of the podcast. So for those of you who didn't follow this statement, I mean, it was eye wateringly vain. I mean, it was like the kind of thing that you'd see from Donald Trump. Essentially, he is so competitive. He could not bear to admit, as far as I'm concerned, that he he wasn't gonna make it. He had about 50 declared supporters, and he claims that he got it's something like a 102. So he's trying to claim that he just crossed the numbers. I don't believe it for a moment. I think the only reason that I don't I can't imagine that there will be people who would have been backing Boris Johnson who would have been doing it secretly. The people who are backing Boris Johnson would have been doing it openly, looking for jobs in Boris Johnson's cabinet. So the reality is unless he tells us differently, He probably only had about 50 out of the 350 conservative MPs. Thank goodness. Right? So he had, you know, less than a 6th of them. But he's also I mean, I think the whole thing was he probably did he did think deep down, it might be possible. I don't know. But one thing we know about Johnson that he loves being talked about loves being the center of attention, but also presumably has some self awareness enough to know that he has a massive job on to rehabilitate his reputation. So he wanted the airwaves to be full of people saying, the guy's a winner, when in fact, I think that's the Johnson of old, not the Johnson of today, that people would forget, as I'm afraid, far too many in the media were far too keen to forget about what actually led to his demise. It just became a sort of a numbers game. But I doubt whether he got more than the ones that declared maybe a few that would were trying to sort of keep a foot in the SUNAT camp in case SUNAT one. So I just I just think that what we're seeing is the I don't know if you saw, Rory, on the BBC last week, I got a mild ticking, very mild because it turned out that Ofcom didn't object. But I I I did say that, Johnson was like the turd that you can't Flush away in the toilet, but I think he is now being flushed away. And he said in his the other thing he said in his statement was that he would be back, and he saw himself possibly as a contender in 24 or whenever. I mean, just go away. You're deluded. It's very Trumpian Trumpian language, isn't it? It's very sort of bigsy. I'm very successful. I'm the biggest. I mean, So last few days, I've been overwhelmed by the number of people who suggested I should once again contest it. I've been attracted because I led our party into a massive Election victory less than 3 years ago, and I believe I'm therefore uniquely placed to avert a general election now. I believe I'm well placed To deliver a conservative victory in 2024, tonight, I can confirm that I've cleared the very high hurdle of a 102 nominations, including a proposer and a Seconder. I don't know why he put that in. I mean, including a proposal and a seconder. He had a 102. Why was he struggling to get 2 people? Anyway, the whole thing was extraordinary. It's a sort of massive sort of narcissistic, egotistic rant. Mhmm. There's therefore a very good chance that I would be successful in And the election with conservative party members and that I could indeed be back in Downing Street on Friday. Unbelievable. I believe I have much offer, but I'm afraid that it's simply not the right Time. In other words, he's at his Cincinnatus, except Cincinnatus famously is very sort of puritanical Roman who went back to his plow. Boris Johnson famously set off to the Caribbean in the middle of the parliamentary working week. Did you not think that was extraordinary as well that he there was next to no commentary about the fact that what on earth was he doing on yet another holiday when parliament's sitting? What do the people of Uxbridge think about the fact that they have this Guy who appears to be as literally have zero interest in them whatever. Except whenever I watch clips on TV and people in Uxbridge are Interview. They're all like, Boris. Yeah. He's great. We're really good on Boris. Can't wait to have him back. It's it's extraordinary. But I I I think that is part of this sort of During Brexit, they feel they have to get a 2 to say this and 2 to say that. I mean, look, I'm I'm sure that the peep sort of people who wander up to me on trains and I was at this football on on Saturday, and I didn't get I got 1 person who said, oh, you I bet you're worried about Boris Johnson coming back. And, but everybody else was a was a sort of mix of disgust and nausea and what the hell is going on. So let's stop talking about Johnson. Let's talk about Rishi Sunak, he's gonna be our youngest prime minister in modern history, a year younger than Tony Blair when Tony became prime minister. He's 42. Is he the shortest? I think he might be. She's 5 what is he? About 5 foot 6? He is quite small. 7. Yeah. He's definitely small. Was 5 foot 6a half. Are you good on prime ministerial height, Rory? Born in the 19 eighties. Wow. Pretty amazing. I feel old. I was born in the fifties for god's sake. But but I remember when David Cameron came in, David Cameron was. So he's born in 66, so he was sort of 44 when he came in. I believe the claim then was that he was the youngest prime minister in something like 200 years of British history, but Blair had been the youngest before him. Liz Truss was very young, but Rishi Sunak's even younger. So it's something we talked about in the podcast before. It's part of the acceleration of British politics that Somehow, the days when Gladstone could sort of go into opposition, come back again, and be prime minister again in his eighties seems to have been replaced by a world Except in the United States, of course, where the people slugging it out seem to be in their mid seventies. In Britain, you you looks like you gotta get younger and younger and younger. And and and we we before we, did the recording with president Hollande, our latest special guest, and before you joined us from Kenya, I was having a little chat in his office, and we were he he was talking about the he'd been following the the death of the queen and the funeral and so forth. And that A shot where you had the the 6 living former prime ministers all lined up. And, he was He was saying, you know, the way you lot are going, the next time you have a big sort of establishment event, what's the maximum number of living former prime ministers you could have? I mean, we've now got Since then, we've had already got 2 more. I mean, King Charles has barely been in the job, and he's got his 2nd prime minister to see in. It's it's abs absolutely unbelievable. And it's also a real sense. I mean so, traditionally, these roles went with seniority, and Churchill, I guess, had been in parliament for almost 40 years before he became prime minister. Macmillan, I guess, had been in 20 or 30 before he became prime minister. I'm deliberately not googling while I'm Talking to you. But Rishi Sunak was elected in 2015. The guy's been in parliament for 7 years. It's extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary. And and even, you know, Keir Starmer only got in in 2010. I mean, it's very, very interesting, the replacement of the emphasis on Experience, age, wisdom. I mean, these these guys, to become prime minister for a couple of 100 years, you had to really knock around quite a lot. You had to do senior positions for a long time before people took QSROC for these roles. I mean, how long do you think Callahan would have been in before he became prime minister? Oh, he'd been around a long time. Just on the Sunak, Rory, you you've talked before couple of times on the podcast before about how you and you used to share a desk in the House of Commons library. What sort of let's deepen the assessment a bit. I mean, I know you had other interactions, but now that he now that he's gonna be the prime So what what what's your deeper and broader assessment of him as a as a human being and as a politician? Well, I've gone round in a real circle on this. So when I first met him, I was really won over because he's very bright. He's very thoughtful, very charming. I was very proud that the conservative party had recruited somebody who was obviously so bright and talented, and I enjoyed my interactions with him. I guess the tension ends in our relationship when he decided to commit Early to Brexit, and I just couldn't understand it. I just couldn't begin to comprehend what he'd done. And I'm afraid I kinda teased him a bit about that, and he understandably Didn't think that was very amusing. We then had standoffs over prisons. He was the minister responsible for collecting council tax, And I thought it was ridiculous that people should be sent to prison for not paying their council tax, and I went to him hoping that I'd get his agreement on that. And we had a very strange argument for half an hour where he was, again, very, very clever, but I felt like I was in a sort of Schoolboy debating competition. I didn't feel I was really able to get over. This is ridiculous. People should not be in prison for not paying their council tax, not paying their TV license. This is not what prisons before when they're already overcrowded, 83,000 people in prisons built for 63,000. So that was, I guess, a low point. And, of course, I was also Felt very, very, sort of negative towards people who joined Boris Johnson's cabinet because I thought Boris Johnson was such A bad person. I mean, one of the reasons why I refused to compromise with him, refused to rejoin the conservative party is that I couldn't bear the idea of running With Boris Johnson's leader, I can bear to put the put a leaflet through a door with his photograph on to say that I think he'd be a good prime minister, let alone serve in his cabinet. I mean, actually, he he had a very interesting I had a interesting conversation with Boris Johnson just before he took over where he got me into his office and said, In his very kinda charming and valiant way, basically implied that he'd like me to continue in his cabinet. I don't know what he would've wanted me to do, maybe to Steyer's secretary state for international development. And, of course, knowing Boris Johnson, he might have changed his mind the next moment or might never meant it anyway. But I had to say to him very clearly, I cannot possibly serve in your cabinet. I actually ran my whole leadership campaign saying I can't serve in your cabinet. Anyway, to cut to the chase, Rishi Sunak was prepared to serve in his cabinet, was prepared to be his chance to exchequer, so that worried me too. All that said, My goodness. I've been through the ringer on alternative conservative leadership candidates. And, of course, at the end of the day, I have concluded that Rishi Sunak is by far better than Boris Johnson, better than Liz Truss, better than half a dozen of the other candidates who ran in the leadership, and And it's probably the only leading conservative now that actually has a chance of being prudent, thoughtful, and restoring some degree of of grown up mature management. So rollercoaster on Rishi Sunak. No. I think that's I think that's really interesting, and and, of course, I know what you mean about going through the ringer. I mean, a A part of me, when Johnson threw his hat back in the ring, thought, oh, this is great for Labour. But at the same time, I felt physically sick The prospect that actually we might have him back and we might have to be talking about it. So, Roy, let me just say once more. Let's try not to talk about Boris Johnson anymore on this podcast. Let's focus back on on Rishi Sunak. I I'd tell you something, I'm I I've I've, when I was presenting Good Morning Britain, I interviewed him One morning, I think it was during the Tory party conference, and I had a sense of somebody very prickly and very And I'd heard this from people at the treasury when he was there, very thin skinned. Do you think he's fully aware? We I talked last week about how people underestimate the gap Between any other job in government and being prime minister, do you think he has that bandwidth and that capacity to move up, in the way that he's about to. Well, I guess we'll find out. I mean, 42, as I say, is very, very, very, very young. And unlike David Cameron or Tony Blair, who were the other 2 very young prime ministers that we've had in the last couple 100 years. They had years in opposition to Prepare, get their manifestos together, build the parties around them. And they had the enormous mandate from winning a huge election. I mean, You know, Tony Blair, extremely able politician. Right? Obviously, extraordinary charisma, very good communicator. But Part of what gave him that power is that he had delivered this incredible majority to a party that had felt in the early nineties they might never win again. So That allows you to silence the party. It means that in the case of Tony Blair, I can't remember. What what was your majority again that first time 97? Oh, 100 and I it's one of the sort of historical fact I should know right up, but it was was it 179? I can't remember. Anyway, Whatever it is Tom Tom's looking it up right now. Anyway, whatever whatever it is, there's, you know, a well over a 100, maybe even 200 labor MPs who felt that they owed their job to Tony Blair, and that's an incredible mandate. And that means even with all the divisions between the kind of left wing Benites And all the things that could have torn the Labour Party apart. So I think David Cameron didn't have that kind of majority, but he had Taken out the Labour Party that felt as though they were unbeatable. The conservatives have struggled very hard in the early 2000, late nineties. So, again, There are lots of MPs. When when I came to the House of Commons in 2010, half the parliamentary conservative party had been Exit for the 1st time and felt they owed their seats largely to David Cameron. So that helps you when you're a very young prime minister. Rishi's coming in younger than all of them, but he doesn't have any of that stuff doesn't have any of that stuff happening. Nobody feels they owe their seat to Rishi Sunak. He hasn't won an unbeatable majority, and he's taking over a party that is so factionalized. As you pointed out last time we chatted, they're they're already the ERGs already on maneuvers. Well, I, I was on over the weekend, I think it's fair to say that the the Bring Back, b o w r I s, I never actually say the b word, campaigners, they set up all these WhatsApp groups, which were remarkably easy for their non supporters to access. And I spent I when I was on the train back from the football at, Sunderland, where I'm sure you shared my delight at our amazing comeback, Rory, from 2 nils 42. Extraordinary victory. Thank you. Thank you. On the trade on the trade back, I was in these WhatsApp groups just sort of Abusing myself at watching. But, honestly, the stuff they were saying about Sunak was extraordinary. And I have to say, a lot of it was racist. What what sort of what what sort of things were they saying? Well, for example, all sooner it's ever done is look after the tech companies, and it's basically all about helping his fellow Indians. There's that sort of thing. There was there was just sort of it was it was just nasty and unpleasant stuff, and it was it was this kind of cult of, of Johnson. It was very, very odd. And then then you then you had 1 last night from David Campbell Bannerman basically saying it was time for a new party now that, you know, But that this is really time to sort of clear it out. But you're absolutely right. He doesn't have that. People might, you know, respect him. Some of these people might respect him, but he doesn't have that kind of loyalty that he's going to need. And I think what was coming through loud and clear reading the exchanges on these groups Was the the idea that it's gonna be easy to bring the Tory party together. And you talk about the, you know, 10, 11, 12 factions. I think it's very hard. And you I think you said the other day that, you know, it's gonna have to be somebody of extraordinary charisma and a great communicator. I'm not sure he's got that. I'm not sure he's got that. It's it's it's a very difficult job, isn't it? A very difficult job. I mean, he's incredibly able. I I think he's got one big thing in his favor, which is that He clearly called out the mess that Liz Truss and Quasi Horten created, which will have given him a reputation for economic prudence and foresight. He is the person that the majority of MPs voted for last time, and my goodness, they've mustered behind him this time. I mean, the the figures At the moment at which we're recording suggests that of the declared figures, he's up, you know, in the 170 region. And Penny Mordent, his nearest rival, is only declaring in the high twenties. These are of declared MPs. There may be people who have Covertly voting, but that that's an extraordinary mandate, and it it'd be interesting to work out who's not getting behind him because Many of the old 1 nation we talked about these factions. You you'll see that his early supporters came from what I would call the sort of 1 nation conservative left, And that was true last time around. I mean, a lot of the people who supported me in the leadership campaign, and there weren't that many of them actually, but a lot of them got behind Rishi Sunak. And that that was striking to me that people who'd who'd been for me, Soren Rishi Sunak Something despite the fact he'd been in Brexiteer. But he's also got people like Suelle Brawhman, who's one of the kind of Spartan champions of the Brexit ERG right behind him. So he's managing at the moment to communicate to the left of the party that he's more thoughtful, more sensible, more grown up And Boris Johnson. But, of course, the Brexiteers will be reassured that he voted Brexit. But the question is, can he keep that coalition together? Well, Steve Baker as well came out for him and and made it very, very Clear that he expects the ERG, mandate as he sees it to to continue to run. I also think I don't know. I think that once you get to the level that he's now at and the profile so for example, there were lots of stories around during the eat out. Was it our help out, to eat out, to help out, where I think there was a sense that maybe he was I don't know. That didn't go as well as he wanted it to. I think some of this tenure at the treasury will now come under greater scrutiny. And I wonder as well where whether his, You know, really vast personal wealth. I mean, there was a $100 on a swimming pool quite recently. I think this is so we're in a Kosovo in crisis when he's gonna have to be taking, Assuming he and and Jeremy Hunt stays chancellor, they'll be taking some very, very tough spending decisions. I wonder whether that then does play in a way that thus far it hasn't. And even the thing about his green card and I do think your point, by the way, Rory, about the fact that he sat literally sat alongside Boris Johnson in that cabinet, Knowing who he was, knowing what he was, knowing that what they were being told to say was lies, and he was the main guy. If you remember, during the election campaign, Soonat was Johnson's main guy on the airwaves. If Johnson couldn't do big interviews, Soonat was the guy who stepped in. So, obviously, having knifed him, and brought him down with Javed at the end. That sort of distances him from that. But, frankly, he I think Labour can really pin Sunak, as part of the 12 year failure of the Tories. So he's all that's gonna be really interesting. I also think that, Obviously, the thing that we're we we haven't talked about explicitly, which is massive, really, really important, is that we're gonna have our 1st Asian prime minister, and I think that's something we should be deeply proud of, really, really proud of. I think it's an Extraordinary thing. I I can't see any other European country doing that, and I think it's a real tribute to Britain that that has happened So comfortably, so quickly, and very few people are remarking on it. And his family story is pretty extraordinary. His his grandparents moved from Punjab, to, 1 lot to Kenya, another lot to Tanzania in, I guess, relatively, was in clerical jobs and then moved back to Britain in the 19 sixties, migrated from East Africa in the 19 sixties. And So his father was born in in Kenya. Mother was born in Tanzania. He's part of a a very strong British story. You know, that's A story that many, many people in Britain share, that movement from India to East Africa and then then to Britain. And I think Just as we should have been very proud in many ways of, Sadiq Khan becoming mayor of London, I think we should be very proud of Rishi Sunak Becoming prime minister. But, obviously, I complain a lot about Sadiq Khan, and you will complain a lot about Rishi Suna. That is true. But, no, I I do agree with that. I I think I think that, You know? And and I funny if I was I was saying to I was talking to Francois Hollande about the British scene earlier before we started the recording, and He was making that point that, you know, that's quite a big thing to have somebody of Indian heritage as the as the prime minister of the UK, And he's and he he mentioned it in the context of you know, particularly, we're talking, you know, before about empire in the context of of our relationship with the Indian subcontinent in the past. So that is a that is a a huge thing. I I do think that one of the reasons the 1922 committee appear to have been pretty desperate To get this thing through without going to vote is because, actually, there is still an awful lot of racism amongst conservative party members. I saw some of that on the WhatsApp groups. But I think it will it will certainly help, I hope, the normalization of Britain as a genuinely multicultural, multinational, Multiracial country, which is a good thing. Anyway, let's take a break. Yeah. Let's take a break. This week's episode is sponsored by the New European. And if you're a reader, You will know that I write for every week as their editor at large, but I do think it's been an absolutely brilliant addition to our media landscape. One of the great things in it is the cultural stuff. So this, Charlie Connolly writes something called Great European Lives where he covers figures such as Sevi Balestiros, who older listeners will remember, great golfer, but also the French singer, Sacha De Stel, who, of course, is somebody who Alastair loves. So anyone interested in European culture too, not just politics. If you want to actually do something positive, Support a new newspaper that is fighting back against the nationalist, populist right wing press that got us or helped to get us into the mess that we're in, then the new European really is the antidote to all their nationalistic brainwashing. They've got a very special offer exclusively for policies listeners. You can get full access to the new European digital edition for just a pound a week. Or if like me, you love getting the actual newspaper delivered to your door, you get that as well for just 2 pound a week. That is less than the price of a coffee, and you'll have the satisfaction of helping support good, honest, high quality journalism, which is quite frankly something we now need more than ever. And that is a point we also discussed with president Hollande. So subscribe today. Just visit www.theneweuropean.co.ukforward/trip, t r I p. That's www.theneweuropean.co.uk/trip. Welcome back to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And I should start, Rory. Listeners might be hearing a bit of sort of background noise It's because I am still in president Hollande's office. And, you know, we we have to allow former presidents to carry on Working even if they're trying to be very, very quiet. Okay? So I just want to if you hear shuffling of papers and envelopes and signatures Thank you. And and And if you if you hear a weird noise in the background, that's because, very kindly, my host here in Kenya have turned on a generator to try to recharge my laptop. So I that's, I'm feeling a bit embarrassed Okay. Towards the environment, but the solar panels weren't able to recharge the laptop for some reason. Okay. Now back quickly. So you were telling us about Nadim Zahawi. What what what was the Nadim Zahawi news? Well, Nadim Zahawi, who, as you know, I control all his movements. I'm inside his head all the time as we showed in the video that we put out a few weeks ago. He wrote a piece yesterday for the Daily Telegraph, which he then tweeted. He confirmed his enduring love and support for Boris Johnson. And literally 2 minutes Later, Boris Johnson announced he was pulling out. And as fast as you could say, I'm determined to get a job, whoever's prime minister, Nadim Subhasa Hari then announced, I'm backing Rishi. It's a bit unfortunate because, of course, famously, he joined he he became Boris Johnson's chancer, didn't he? And then he had to move within 24 hours To topple Boris Johnson, and then he had to put out a tweet saying, that Boris had learned from his mistakes, and he was a different Boris from the one that he'd known 2 months earlier. And now he's I mean, it's it's real. It's a it's a terrible slope slipping back and forth. He he did a he did a tweet yes yesterday, which began with the words, when I was chancellor. And I think it's a bit like when I Laurie, when I say, as I often do, When I played football with Diego Maradona, I do know that I I come across as a complete prat, and I'm exaggerating my importance as a footballer. But to start for him to say, when I was chancellor, I mean, he was there for about 2 minutes. Now let me just put on the record. I really like like Nadim Zari, and I I'm sorry for him, and I'm sorry that these all these things have happened. He is one of the most You know, he joined with me in 2010. He's one of the most lovely, warmhearted, colleagues, and, you know, I feel I feel embarrassed So this has happened to him, but I think he's a great guy, and I'm sorry that he's getting stuck in this way. There we go. You see, I I have to say it's a it's a minor part of a bigger story. Just on Rishi Suna, well, so we know A fair bit about him, we know about his kinda life story a fair bit. I'm sure there's more to come. We know what he was like as Chances, it's checker, but not in a very normal you know, he he I I'm sure he wasn't enjoying spending 1,000,000,000 on furlough schemes and and so forth. We know that he's on the right of the conservative party. I've always seen him as one of these kind of sovereign individual types. That could be fair or unfair. I don't know. We know that he's from an incredibly wealthy family, but I don't have a clue, for example, other than the fact that he voted Brexit. I don't have a clue what his approach to foreign policy is going to be, What his view of the United States is, what his view of China is, what his view of Russia is. I just don't know what his foreign policy views are, and that's gonna become Quite important quite quickly. Will become very important. Just just on record, his his parents are not in cryptography. I mean, his parents, his father's a a GP. His wife's family is the extraordinary story. His his wife's father founded Infosys, which was and it's really the kind of founder of, Basically, the founder of the amazing technology revolution in India built a CEO over, I guess, 30 years, this incredible global company From relatively modest beginnings. It's it's a pretty amazing story, there, but you're right. He's he's married the daughter, Ineres. It'd be like marrying, kind of, I guess, I don't know. Bill Gates' daughter or something. I mean, you end up with a huge, huge, huge fortune. I think £770,000,000 is what they claim, but I don't who knows what the What what the numbers are? By the time you're that wealthy, it's quite difficult to to make any sense there at all. On foreign policy, he's not been foreign sexually, and this was a problem with Liz Truss. And, again, like Liz Truss, he hasn't spoken much about foreign affairs, so it's quite difficult finding one's way towards that. I I guess, You know, like many Brexiteers, it would have made pro Chinese comments because a lot of the Brexit gamble was about being able to swap Slow growth in Europe for rapid growth in China. And, of course, that bet is looking much more difficult now, isn't it? Mhmm. Mhmm. But we don't really know that much whether he has a real genuine political philosophy. And, of course, he is coming in. You've said this before. He's coming in It's an incredibly difficult time, politically, economically. His party, I think, is gonna tear itself apart pretty quickly. And Do you think if he'd I mean, look. This is me sort of looking way into a future that may come, may not. But Let's just imagine that the conservative party does crash and burn again. We can't do it. We can't surely, 5 5 prime ministers in 6 years. I mean, I think there should be a general election anyway, But they can't do it again, can they? Surely, this has to be it in terms of changes of prime minister. I think I think they will definitely think this has to be it. And, I I think I think you you can't keep doing this. And but but if they if it collapses again, I mean, I think people will simply give up because the reason it will collapse again is that people have just totally lost any, any confidence that they can hold the party together. It'll become an unmanageable Collapsing coalition. One of the problems he's gonna face is putting a putting a cabinet together. Lots of, quite talented, ministers left over the last few years. Quite a lot more have signaled they're leaving, But I'd like to see, given his use, that he starts bringing back some of the people who were ministers under previous governments. You know? There are people like Nick Gibb, who's It's a very good education minister. Be nice to see brought back. Well, Rory, we could we could be here all day on that one, Rory. We're ready? You think there's a lot a lot we could bring back in? So. Yeah. I think you you you you yeah. I think you and I are going to differ hugely on the record of the Cameron and May governments on education. But let's not let's not go there because we'll disagree, disagreeably on that one. Let but what about Michael Gove? Do you think you should bring back Michael Gove? And do you think there's also a case for bringing back Theresa May? I think you should bring back Michael Gove. He should make Theresa May foreign secretary would be a good, quick move. I'd like to see that. I'd like to see him bring in Mel Stride, who's chair of the treasury committee. I'd like to see the people that haven't been promoted that should have done, and I would have loved to see running for leader now. I I keep talking about Gillian Keegan, who's African minister at moment, but very, very talented. Alex Chalk, who's a a lawyer, very smart, thoughtful guy who rec represents Cheltenham. There is talent there, and it'd be nice to see it brought in. What worries me is that a loss of ideologues without much substance have been promoted very, very quickly into the cabinet without much behind them. And they're gonna feel that they should be clinging on because Boris Johnson put men. He created a cabinet, essentially, where there were far too many loyalists without much substance to them and left on the backbenches. Many people are or as junior ministers, many people with a bit of spirit and drive to them. I'd like to see Victoria Prentiss in a more senior position, but what Some listeners won't have heard of these people partly because Boris Johnson deliberately, in this trust, deliberately excluded them from senior office. But but, also, if he brings in all this New talent that you're describing, that means pushing out other people, making them Even angrier, even more bitter. Do you think he's got the political management skills that are going to be called upon to hold this thing together. Because I think I think that's a real you know, if you think about just just look at the damage that Michael Gove did very subtly and sometimes less subtly to Liz Truss, But that was because he was on the outside. So, like, you bring in Theresa May as let's say he did bring her in as foreign secretary, that means you're getting rid of James Cleverley. He's gonna be offside. I think if he brings in some of the other people you mentioned, presumably, that means there's no place for Sona Braverman, no place for Steve Baker is currently ludicrously administering Northern Ireland. So these are huge problems that he's going to have to both solve and then create more problems. And this is one of the reasons why these big parties in the end have a sort of lifespan. They can't keep going. I mean, this is what, in a in a way, was one of the things that presumably began to be a bit of a problem for Gordon Brown as well that after you've been in office For a few years, you have had to throw quite a lot of senior people out of the cabinet. You've got quite a lot of younger people who are angry that they haven't been promoted. You can get away with that more easily In the 1st 5 years when you're on the honeymoon period. But as years go on, you've got more and more people who feel that they're big beasts, who've been in the cabinet who are bitter about not being back in and more and more younger people who feel they're excluded. So you're absolutely right. There are some really impressive people out there. I would love a conservative party that had friend of mine called Damian Hines, who I think is a fantastic guy. I'd love to see him back in the cabinet, But trying to do that is gonna cause problems. And if you add to that, the factionalization at this point that I keep making that there are now Twelve different conservative parties. There's a kind of Singapore conservative party. There's a Jacob Rees Mogg conservative party, which is a sort of Victorian conservative party. There's the fragments for pro European conservative party. There's Steve Baker's Christian conservative party. All these types of parties pushing in different directions. This is libertarians? There are the libertarians. There's the Liz Truss quasi court conservative party. You've noticed the Institute For Economic Affairs. You're great. Fravent, Tufton Street think tank out there saying the problem was that it wasn't implemented correctly. They keep saying that these decisions, these economic decisions, were Absolutely fine. They just weren't implemented correctly, which is That's very Ben that is very Benite. Very Benite. Benite, isn't it? Yeah. We just socialist enough. Yeah. Well, we'll see. We shall see. It's going to be very, very interesting to see how Rishi Sunak beds in, as you say, to see what his team is, who he surrounds himself with, and also how the Labour Party reacts to it and how the other parties as well. But, I just hope to god we have a general election sooner rather than later because I honestly, it's so nice to be in France, Roy. I know they've got massive problems at the moment, but it feels quite sort of stable and normal, and There's no fanaticism going around the place. How's Kenya? Well, Kenya's Kenya's got some trouble. I mean, we we should talk about this sometime. I mean, Africa in general is at the receiving end of all the horrors of the world. And as Britain and Europe and the United States hit economic problems and feel poorer. They're gonna be providing less and less assistance at exactly the moment when We need debt forgiveness here. We need massive development programs. We need real sort about food security in Africa, Climate change. I mean, here in Kenya, I'm in a place where there's barely been any rain for 3 years. You can see all the cattle have got their bones sticking out of their flesh. I mean, it's It's pretty bleak, and that's much, much worse up in Somalia and Northern Kenya. But, Rory, I just wanna say, if you read volumes 1 to 8 of my diaries, you will find many accounts of me breaking into holidays to the annoyance of my family, and I do not recommend that you do it too often. So thank you for breaking into your holiday today. We've recorded this is the main podcast. We've recorded a q and a, which will be going out later in the week. We've recorded an interview with president Hollande. And tomorrow, I shall be flying solo, insisting that you have your holiday when I do an interview with the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, which will be going out in the near future as well. So have a nice holiday, and, try not to worry about either the podcast ratings. They're doing very, very well, Rory. Not to worry. And or the future of the country, which is not doing quite as well.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, Alsair, you're you're still in France, and I am still in Africa, with which a big apology, please, to listeners because we're recording this On Monday afternoon, I have left my family. We are we're very, very lucky. We're on a safari in Kenya, And we've been looking at wonderful animals with a 5 year old and a 7 year old, but I've left them for 3 hours to try to find my way to an Internet connection to record this. But that means that we are recording At a time when it's still not clear exactly what's happening to serve his leadership, but it my guess is, and I'm betting hard on this. And, please, You know, I'll be humiliated if I'm not right that Rishi Sunak is going to be the only one who will cross a 100 backers, which just means Rishi Sunak will be our next prime minister, and I'm gonna record on that basis.\n\nAnd if I'm wrong, you can all laugh at me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, you wouldn't I mean, I think that would be harsh to laugh at you, Rory. I think we'll be I I will be, just reflecting on the fact that we will now have had 5 conservative prime ministers in 6 years, it really is the sort of thing we used to laugh at Italy for. So we've gone Cameron, May, Johnson, Truss, and now Rishi Sunak. And We had that sort of convulsion at the weekend as the attention seeker in chief and the charlatan in chief decided that what the country needed was for Him to come back and, expose us to more lies and law breaking, no doubt. That's gone.\n\nI Expect that his statement I don't know how many untruths there would have been in his statement last night that he'd got over the limit, but decided\n\nSpeaker 1: It was it was infuriating. Can can we just cut in on that just for our listeners readers of the podcast. So for those of you who didn't follow this statement, I mean, it was eye wateringly vain. I mean, it was like the kind of thing that you'd see from Donald Trump. Essentially, he is so competitive.\n\nHe could not bear to admit, as far as I'm concerned, that he he wasn't gonna make it. He had about 50 declared supporters, and he claims that he got it's something like a 102. So he's trying to claim that he just crossed the numbers. I don't believe it for a moment. I think the only reason that I don't I can't imagine that there will be people who would have been backing Boris Johnson who would have been doing it secretly.\n\nThe people who are backing Boris Johnson would have been doing it openly, looking for jobs in Boris Johnson's cabinet. So the reality is unless he tells us differently, He probably only had about 50 out of the 350 conservative MPs. Thank goodness. Right? So he had, you know, less than a 6th of them.\n\nSpeaker 0: But he's also I mean, I think the whole thing was he probably did he did think deep down, it might be possible. I don't know. But one thing we know about Johnson that he loves being talked about loves being the center of attention, but also presumably has some self awareness enough to know that he has a massive job on to rehabilitate his reputation. So he wanted the airwaves to be full of people saying, the guy's a winner, when in fact, I think that's the Johnson of old, not the Johnson of today, that people would forget, as I'm afraid, far too many in the media were far too keen to forget about what actually led to his demise. It just became a sort of a numbers game.\n\nBut I doubt whether he got more than the ones that declared maybe a few that would were trying to sort of keep a foot in the SUNAT camp in case SUNAT one. So I just I just think that what we're seeing is the I don't know if you saw, Rory, on the BBC last week, I got a mild ticking, very mild because it turned out that Ofcom didn't object. But I I I did say that, Johnson was like the turd that you can't Flush away in the toilet, but I think he is now being flushed away. And he said in his the other thing he said in his statement was that he would be back, and he saw himself possibly as a contender in 24 or whenever. I mean, just go away.\n\nYou're deluded.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's very Trumpian Trumpian language, isn't it? It's very sort of bigsy. I'm very successful. I'm the biggest. I mean, So last few days, I've been overwhelmed by the number of people who suggested I should once again contest it.\n\nI've been attracted because I led our party into a massive Election victory less than 3 years ago, and I believe I'm therefore uniquely placed to avert a general election now. I believe I'm well placed To deliver a conservative victory in 2024, tonight, I can confirm that I've cleared the very high hurdle of a 102 nominations, including a proposer and a Seconder. I don't know why he put that in. I mean, including a proposal and a seconder. He had a 102.\n\nWhy was he struggling to get 2 people? Anyway, the whole thing was extraordinary. It's a sort of massive sort of narcissistic, egotistic rant. Mhmm. There's therefore a very good chance that I would be successful in And the election with conservative party members and that I could indeed be back in Downing Street on Friday.\n\nUnbelievable. I believe I have much offer, but I'm afraid that it's simply not the right Time. In other words, he's at his Cincinnatus, except Cincinnatus famously is very sort of puritanical Roman who went back to his plow. Boris Johnson famously set off to the Caribbean in the middle of the parliamentary working week.\n\nSpeaker 0: Did you not think that was extraordinary as well that he there was next to no commentary about the fact that what on earth was he doing on yet another holiday when parliament's sitting? What do the people of Uxbridge think about the fact that they have this Guy who appears to be as literally have zero interest in them whatever.\n\nSpeaker 1: Except whenever I watch clips on TV and people in Uxbridge are Interview. They're all like, Boris. Yeah. He's great. We're really good on Boris.\n\nCan't wait to have him back. It's it's extraordinary.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I I I think that is part of this sort of During Brexit, they feel they have to get a 2 to say this and 2 to say that. I mean, look, I'm I'm sure that the peep sort of people who wander up to me on trains and I was at this football on on Saturday, and I didn't get I got 1 person who said, oh, you I bet you're worried about Boris Johnson coming back. And, but everybody else was a was a sort of mix of disgust and nausea and what the hell is going on. So let's stop talking about Johnson. Let's talk about Rishi Sunak, he's gonna be our youngest prime minister in modern history, a year younger than Tony Blair when Tony became prime minister.\n\nHe's 42. Is he the shortest? I think he might be. She's 5 what is he? About 5 foot 6?\n\nHe is quite small.\n\nSpeaker 1: 7. Yeah. He's definitely small.\n\nSpeaker 0: Was 5 foot 6a half. Are you good on prime ministerial height, Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Born in the 19 eighties. Wow. Pretty amazing.\n\nSpeaker 0: I feel old. I was born in the fifties for god's sake. But but I remember\n\nSpeaker 1: when David Cameron came in, David Cameron was. So he's born in 66, so he was sort of 44 when he came in. I believe the claim then was that he was the youngest prime minister in something like 200 years of British history, but Blair had been the youngest before him. Liz Truss was very young, but Rishi Sunak's even younger. So it's something we talked about in the podcast before.\n\nIt's part of the acceleration of British politics that Somehow, the days when Gladstone could sort of go into opposition, come back again, and be prime minister again in his eighties seems to have been replaced by a world Except in the United States, of course, where the people slugging it out seem to be in their mid seventies. In Britain, you you looks like you gotta get younger and younger and younger.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and and we we before we, did the recording with president Hollande, our latest special guest, and before you joined us from Kenya, I was having a little chat in his office, and we were he he was talking about the he'd been following the the death of the queen and the funeral and so forth. And that A shot where you had the the 6 living former prime ministers all lined up. And, he was He was saying, you know, the way you lot are going, the next time you have a big sort of establishment event, what's the maximum number of living former prime ministers you could have? I mean, we've now got Since then, we've had already got 2 more. I mean, King Charles has barely been in the job, and he's got his 2nd prime minister to see in.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's abs absolutely unbelievable. And it's also a real sense. I mean so, traditionally, these roles went with seniority, and Churchill, I guess, had been in parliament for almost 40 years before he became prime minister. Macmillan, I guess, had been in 20 or 30 before he became prime minister. I'm deliberately not googling while I'm Talking to you.\n\nBut Rishi Sunak was elected in 2015. The guy's been in parliament for 7 years. It's extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary. And and even, you know, Keir Starmer only got in in 2010.\n\nI mean, it's very, very interesting, the replacement of the emphasis on Experience, age, wisdom. I mean, these these guys, to become prime minister for a couple of 100 years, you had to really knock around quite a lot. You had to do senior positions for a long time before people took QSROC for these roles. I mean, how long do you think Callahan would have been in before he became prime minister?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, he'd been around a long time. Just on the Sunak, Rory, you you've talked before couple of times on the podcast before about how you and you used to share a desk in the House of Commons library. What sort of let's deepen the assessment a bit. I mean, I know you had other interactions, but now that he now that he's gonna be the prime So what what what's your deeper and broader assessment of him as a as a human being and as a politician?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I've gone round in a real circle on this. So when I first met him, I was really won over because he's very bright. He's very thoughtful, very charming. I was very proud that the conservative party had recruited somebody who was obviously so bright and talented, and I enjoyed my interactions with him. I guess the tension ends in our relationship when he decided to commit Early to Brexit, and I just couldn't understand it.\n\nI just couldn't begin to comprehend what he'd done. And I'm afraid I kinda teased him a bit about that, and he understandably Didn't think that was very amusing. We then had standoffs over prisons. He was the minister responsible for collecting council tax, And I thought it was ridiculous that people should be sent to prison for not paying their council tax, and I went to him hoping that I'd get his agreement on that. And we had a very strange argument for half an hour where he was, again, very, very clever, but I felt like I was in a sort of Schoolboy debating competition.\n\nI didn't feel I was really able to get over. This is ridiculous. People should not be in prison for not paying their council tax, not paying their TV license. This is not what prisons before when they're already overcrowded, 83,000 people in prisons built for 63,000. So that was, I guess, a low point.\n\nAnd, of course, I was also Felt very, very, sort of negative towards people who joined Boris Johnson's cabinet because I thought Boris Johnson was such A bad person. I mean, one of the reasons why I refused to compromise with him, refused to rejoin the conservative party is that I couldn't bear the idea of running With Boris Johnson's leader, I can bear to put the put a leaflet through a door with his photograph on to say that I think he'd be a good prime minister, let alone serve in his cabinet. I mean, actually, he he had a very interesting I had a interesting conversation with Boris Johnson just before he took over where he got me into his office and said, In his very kinda charming and valiant way, basically implied that he'd like me to continue in his cabinet. I don't know what he would've wanted me to do, maybe to Steyer's secretary state for international development. And, of course, knowing Boris Johnson, he might have changed his mind the next moment or might never meant it anyway.\n\nBut I had to say to him very clearly, I cannot possibly serve in your cabinet. I actually ran my whole leadership campaign saying I can't serve in your cabinet. Anyway, to cut to the chase, Rishi Sunak was prepared to serve in his cabinet, was prepared to be his chance to exchequer, so that worried me too. All that said, My goodness. I've been through the ringer on alternative conservative leadership candidates.\n\nAnd, of course, at the end of the day, I have concluded that Rishi Sunak is by far better than Boris Johnson, better than Liz Truss, better than half a dozen of the other candidates who ran in the leadership, and And it's probably the only leading conservative now that actually has a chance of being prudent, thoughtful, and restoring some degree of of grown up mature management. So rollercoaster on Rishi Sunak.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I think that's I think that's really interesting, and and, of course, I know what you mean about going through the ringer. I mean, a A part of me, when Johnson threw his hat back in the ring, thought, oh, this is great for Labour. But at the same time, I felt physically sick The prospect that actually we might have him back and we might have to be talking about it. So, Roy, let me just say once more.\n\nLet's try not to talk about Boris Johnson anymore on this podcast. Let's focus back on on Rishi Sunak. I I'd tell you something, I'm I I've I've, when I was presenting Good Morning Britain, I interviewed him One morning, I think it was during the Tory party conference, and I had a sense of somebody very prickly and very And I'd heard this from people at the treasury when he was there, very thin skinned. Do you think he's fully aware? We I talked last week about how people underestimate the gap Between any other job in government and being prime minister, do you think he has that bandwidth and that capacity to move up, in the way that he's about to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I guess we'll find out. I mean, 42, as I say, is very, very, very, very young. And unlike David Cameron or Tony Blair, who were the other 2 very young prime ministers that we've had in the last couple 100 years. They had years in opposition to Prepare, get their manifestos together, build the parties around them. And they had the enormous mandate from winning a huge election.\n\nI mean, You know, Tony Blair, extremely able politician. Right? Obviously, extraordinary charisma, very good communicator. But Part of what gave him that power is that he had delivered this incredible majority to a party that had felt in the early nineties they might never win again. So That allows you to silence the party.\n\nIt means that in the case of Tony Blair, I can't remember. What what was your majority again that first time 97?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, 100 and I it's one of the sort of historical fact I should know right up, but it was was it 179? I can't remember. Anyway, Whatever it is Tom Tom's looking it up right now.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, whatever whatever it is, there's, you know, a well over a 100, maybe even 200 labor MPs who felt that they owed their job to Tony Blair, and that's an incredible mandate. And that means even with all the divisions between the kind of left wing Benites And all the things that could have torn the Labour Party apart. So I think David Cameron didn't have that kind of majority, but he had Taken out the Labour Party that felt as though they were unbeatable. The conservatives have struggled very hard in the early 2000, late nineties. So, again, There are lots of MPs.\n\nWhen when I came to the House of Commons in 2010, half the parliamentary conservative party had been Exit for the 1st time and felt they owed their seats largely to David Cameron. So that helps you when you're a very young prime minister. Rishi's coming in younger than all of them, but he doesn't have any of that stuff doesn't have any of that stuff happening. Nobody feels they owe their seat to Rishi Sunak. He hasn't won an unbeatable majority, and he's taking over a party that is so factionalized.\n\nAs you pointed out last time we chatted, they're they're already the ERGs already on maneuvers.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I, I was on over the weekend, I think it's fair to say that the the Bring Back, b o w r I s, I never actually say the b word, campaigners, they set up all these WhatsApp groups, which were remarkably easy for their non supporters to access. And I spent I when I was on the train back from the football at, Sunderland, where I'm sure you shared my delight at our amazing comeback, Rory, from 2 nils 42.\n\nSpeaker 1: Extraordinary victory.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Thank you. On the trade on the trade back, I was in these WhatsApp groups just sort of Abusing myself at watching. But, honestly, the stuff they were saying about Sunak was extraordinary. And I have to say, a lot of it was racist.\n\nSpeaker 1: What what sort of what what sort of things were they saying?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, for example, all sooner it's ever done is look after the tech companies, and it's basically all about helping his fellow Indians. There's that sort of thing. There was there was just sort of it was it was just nasty and unpleasant stuff, and it was it was this kind of cult of, of Johnson. It was very, very odd. And then then you then you had 1 last night from David Campbell Bannerman basically saying it was time for a new party now that, you know, But that this is really time to sort of clear it out.\n\nBut you're absolutely right. He doesn't have that. People might, you know, respect him. Some of these people might respect him, but he doesn't have that kind of loyalty that he's going to need. And I think what was coming through loud and clear reading the exchanges on these groups Was the the idea that it's gonna be easy to bring the Tory party together.\n\nAnd you talk about the, you know, 10, 11, 12 factions. I think it's very hard. And you I think you said the other day that, you know, it's gonna have to be somebody of extraordinary charisma and a great communicator. I'm not sure he's got that. I'm not sure he's got that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's it's a very difficult job, isn't it? A very difficult job. I mean, he's incredibly able. I I think he's got one big thing in his favor, which is that He clearly called out the mess that Liz Truss and Quasi Horten created, which will have given him a reputation for economic prudence and foresight. He is the person that the majority of MPs voted for last time, and my goodness, they've mustered behind him this time.\n\nI mean, the the figures At the moment at which we're recording suggests that of the declared figures, he's up, you know, in the 170 region. And Penny Mordent, his nearest rival, is only declaring in the high twenties. These are of declared MPs. There may be people who have Covertly voting, but that that's an extraordinary mandate, and it it'd be interesting to work out who's not getting behind him because Many of the old 1 nation we talked about these factions. You you'll see that his early supporters came from what I would call the sort of 1 nation conservative left, And that was true last time around.\n\nI mean, a lot of the people who supported me in the leadership campaign, and there weren't that many of them actually, but a lot of them got behind Rishi Sunak. And that that was striking to me that people who'd who'd been for me, Soren Rishi Sunak Something despite the fact he'd been in Brexiteer. But he's also got people like Suelle Brawhman, who's one of the kind of Spartan champions of the Brexit ERG right behind him. So he's managing at the moment to communicate to the left of the party that he's more thoughtful, more sensible, more grown up And Boris Johnson. But, of course, the Brexiteers will be reassured that he voted Brexit.\n\nBut the question is, can he keep that coalition together?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Steve Baker as well came out for him and and made it very, very Clear that he expects the ERG, mandate as he sees it to to continue to run. I also think I don't know. I think that once you get to the level that he's now at and the profile so for example, there were lots of stories around during the eat out. Was it our help out, to eat out, to help out, where I think there was a sense that maybe he was I don't know. That didn't go as well as he wanted it to.\n\nI think some of this tenure at the treasury will now come under greater scrutiny. And I wonder as well where whether his, You know, really vast personal wealth. I mean, there was a $100 on a swimming pool quite recently. I think this is so we're in a Kosovo in crisis when he's gonna have to be taking, Assuming he and and Jeremy Hunt stays chancellor, they'll be taking some very, very tough spending decisions. I wonder whether that then does play in a way that thus far it hasn't.\n\nAnd even the thing about his green card and I do think your point, by the way, Rory, about the fact that he sat literally sat alongside Boris Johnson in that cabinet, Knowing who he was, knowing what he was, knowing that what they were being told to say was lies, and he was the main guy. If you remember, during the election campaign, Soonat was Johnson's main guy on the airwaves. If Johnson couldn't do big interviews, Soonat was the guy who stepped in. So, obviously, having knifed him, and brought him down with Javed at the end. That sort of distances him from that.\n\nBut, frankly, he I think Labour can really pin Sunak, as part of the 12 year failure of the Tories.\n\nSpeaker 1: So he's all that's gonna be really interesting. I also think that, Obviously, the thing that we're we we haven't talked about explicitly, which is massive, really, really important, is that we're gonna have our 1st Asian prime minister, and I think that's something we should be deeply proud of, really, really proud of. I think it's an Extraordinary thing. I I can't see any other European country doing that, and I think it's a real tribute to Britain that that has happened So comfortably, so quickly, and very few people are remarking on it. And his family story is pretty extraordinary.\n\nHis his grandparents moved from Punjab, to, 1 lot to Kenya, another lot to Tanzania in, I guess, relatively, was in clerical jobs and then moved back to Britain in the 19 sixties, migrated from East Africa in the 19 sixties. And So his father was born in in Kenya. Mother was born in Tanzania. He's part of a a very strong British story. You know, that's A story that many, many people in Britain share, that movement from India to East Africa and then then to Britain.\n\nAnd I think Just as we should have been very proud in many ways of, Sadiq Khan becoming mayor of London, I think we should be very proud of Rishi Sunak Becoming prime minister. But, obviously, I complain a lot about Sadiq Khan, and you will complain a lot about Rishi Suna.\n\nSpeaker 0: That is true. But, no, I I do agree with that. I I think I think that, You know? And and I funny if I was I was saying to I was talking to Francois Hollande about the British scene earlier before we started the recording, and He was making that point that, you know, that's quite a big thing to have somebody of Indian heritage as the as the prime minister of the UK, And he's and he he mentioned it in the context of you know, particularly, we're talking, you know, before about empire in the context of of our relationship with the Indian subcontinent in the past. So that is a that is a a huge thing.\n\nI I do think that one of the reasons the 1922 committee appear to have been pretty desperate To get this thing through without going to vote is because, actually, there is still an awful lot of racism amongst conservative party members. I saw some of that on the WhatsApp groups. But I think it will it will certainly help, I hope, the normalization of Britain as a genuinely multicultural, multinational, Multiracial country, which is a good thing. Anyway, let's take a break.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let's take a break.\n\nSpeaker 0: This week's episode is sponsored by the New European. And if you're a reader, You will know that I write for every week as their editor at large, but I do think it's been an absolutely brilliant addition to our media landscape.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of the great things in it is the cultural stuff. So this, Charlie Connolly writes something called Great European Lives where he covers figures such as Sevi Balestiros, who older listeners will remember, great golfer, but also the French singer, Sacha De Stel, who, of course, is somebody who Alastair loves. So anyone interested in European culture too, not just politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: If you want to actually do something positive, Support a new newspaper that is fighting back against the nationalist, populist right wing press that got us or helped to get us into the mess that we're in, then the new European really is the antidote to all their nationalistic brainwashing. They've got a very special offer exclusively for policies listeners. You can get full access to the new European digital edition for just a pound a week. Or if like me, you love getting the actual newspaper delivered to your door, you get that as well for just 2 pound a week. That is less than the price of a coffee, and you'll have the satisfaction of helping support good, honest, high quality journalism, which is quite frankly something we now need more than ever.\n\nAnd that is a point we also discussed with president Hollande. So subscribe today. Just visit www.theneweuropean.co.ukforward/trip, t r I p. That's www.theneweuropean.co.uk/trip.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome back to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell. And I should start, Rory. Listeners might be hearing a bit of sort of background noise It's because I am still in president Hollande's office. And, you know, we we have to allow former presidents to carry on Working even if they're trying to be very, very quiet. Okay?\n\nSo I just want to if you hear shuffling of papers and envelopes and signatures\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And and And if you if you hear a weird noise in the background, that's because, very kindly, my host here in Kenya have turned on a generator to try to recharge my laptop. So I that's, I'm feeling a bit embarrassed Okay. Towards the environment, but the solar panels weren't able to recharge the laptop for some reason. Okay.\n\nNow back quickly. So you were telling us about Nadim Zahawi. What what what was the Nadim Zahawi news?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Nadim Zahawi, who, as you know, I control all his movements. I'm inside his head all the time as we showed in the video that we put out a few weeks ago. He wrote a piece yesterday for the Daily Telegraph, which he then tweeted. He confirmed his enduring love and support for Boris Johnson. And literally 2 minutes Later, Boris Johnson announced he was pulling out.\n\nAnd as fast as you could say, I'm determined to get a job, whoever's prime minister, Nadim Subhasa Hari then announced, I'm backing Rishi.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a bit unfortunate because, of course, famously, he joined he he became Boris Johnson's chancer, didn't he? And then he had to move within 24 hours To topple Boris Johnson, and then he had to put out a tweet saying, that Boris had learned from his mistakes, and he was a different Boris from the one that he'd known 2 months earlier. And now he's I mean, it's it's real. It's a it's a terrible slope slipping back and forth.\n\nSpeaker 0: He he did a he did a tweet yes yesterday, which began with the words, when I was chancellor. And I think it's a bit like when I Laurie, when I say, as I often do, When I played football with Diego Maradona, I do know that I I come across as a complete prat, and I'm exaggerating my importance as a footballer. But to start for him to say, when I was chancellor, I mean, he was there for about 2 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now let me just put on the record. I really like like Nadim Zari, and I I'm sorry for him, and I'm sorry that these all these things have happened. He is one of the most You know, he joined with me in 2010. He's one of the most lovely, warmhearted, colleagues, and, you know, I feel I feel embarrassed So this has happened to him, but I think he's a great guy, and I'm sorry that he's getting stuck in this way.\n\nSpeaker 0: There we go. You see, I I have to say it's a it's a minor part of a bigger story. Just on Rishi Suna, well, so we know A fair bit about him, we know about his kinda life story a fair bit. I'm sure there's more to come. We know what he was like as Chances, it's checker, but not in a very normal you know, he he I I'm sure he wasn't enjoying spending 1,000,000,000 on furlough schemes and and so forth.\n\nWe know that he's on the right of the conservative party. I've always seen him as one of these kind of sovereign individual types. That could be fair or unfair. I don't know. We know that he's from an incredibly wealthy family, but I don't have a clue, for example, other than the fact that he voted Brexit.\n\nI don't have a clue what his approach to foreign policy is going to be, What his view of the United States is, what his view of China is, what his view of Russia is. I just don't know what his foreign policy views are, and that's gonna become Quite important quite quickly.\n\nSpeaker 1: Will become very important. Just just on record, his his parents are not in cryptography. I mean, his parents, his father's a a GP. His wife's family is the extraordinary story. His his wife's father founded Infosys, which was and it's really the kind of founder of, Basically, the founder of the amazing technology revolution in India built a CEO over, I guess, 30 years, this incredible global company From relatively modest beginnings.\n\nIt's it's a pretty amazing story, there, but you're right. He's he's married the daughter, Ineres. It'd be like marrying, kind of, I guess, I don't know. Bill Gates' daughter or something. I mean, you end up with a huge, huge, huge fortune.\n\nI think £770,000,000 is what they claim, but I don't who knows what the What what the numbers are? By the time you're that wealthy, it's quite difficult to to make any sense there at all. On foreign policy, he's not been foreign sexually, and this was a problem with Liz Truss. And, again, like Liz Truss, he hasn't spoken much about foreign affairs, so it's quite difficult finding one's way towards that. I I guess, You know, like many Brexiteers, it would have made pro Chinese comments because a lot of the Brexit gamble was about being able to swap Slow growth in Europe for rapid growth in China.\n\nAnd, of course, that bet is looking much more difficult now, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Mhmm. But we don't really know that much whether he has a real genuine political philosophy. And, of course, he is coming in. You've said this before.\n\nHe's coming in It's an incredibly difficult time, politically, economically. His party, I think, is gonna tear itself apart pretty quickly. And Do you think if he'd I mean, look. This is me sort of looking way into a future that may come, may not. But Let's just imagine that the conservative party does crash and burn again.\n\nWe can't do it. We can't surely, 5 5 prime ministers in 6 years. I mean, I think there should be a general election anyway, But they can't do it again, can they? Surely, this has to be it in terms of changes of prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I think they will definitely think this has to be it. And, I I think I think you you can't keep doing this. And but but if they if it collapses again, I mean, I think people will simply give up because the reason it will collapse again is that people have just totally lost any, any confidence that they can hold the party together. It'll become an unmanageable Collapsing coalition. One of the problems he's gonna face is putting a putting a cabinet together.\n\nLots of, quite talented, ministers left over the last few years. Quite a lot more have signaled they're leaving, But I'd like to see, given his use, that he starts bringing back some of the people who were ministers under previous governments. You know? There are people like Nick Gibb, who's It's a very good education minister. Be nice to see brought back.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Rory, we could we could be here all day on that one, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're ready? You think there's a lot a lot we could bring back in?\n\nSpeaker 0: So. Yeah. I think you you you you yeah. I think you and I are going to differ hugely on the record of the Cameron and May governments on education. But let's not let's not go there because we'll disagree, disagreeably on that one.\n\nLet but what about Michael Gove? Do you think you should bring back Michael Gove? And do you think there's also a case for bringing back Theresa May?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think you should bring back Michael Gove. He should make Theresa May foreign secretary would be a good, quick move. I'd like to see that. I'd like to see him bring in Mel Stride, who's chair of the treasury committee. I'd like to see the people that haven't been promoted that should have done, and I would have loved to see running for leader now.\n\nI I keep talking about Gillian Keegan, who's African minister at moment, but very, very talented. Alex Chalk, who's a a lawyer, very smart, thoughtful guy who rec represents Cheltenham. There is talent there, and it'd be nice to see it brought in. What worries me is that a loss of ideologues without much substance have been promoted very, very quickly into the cabinet without much behind them. And they're gonna feel that they should be clinging on because Boris Johnson put men.\n\nHe created a cabinet, essentially, where there were far too many loyalists without much substance to them and left on the backbenches. Many people are or as junior ministers, many people with a bit of spirit and drive to them. I'd like to see Victoria Prentiss in a more senior position, but what Some listeners won't have heard of these people partly because Boris Johnson deliberately, in this trust, deliberately excluded them from senior office.\n\nSpeaker 0: But but, also, if he brings in all this New talent that you're describing, that means pushing out other people, making them Even angrier, even more bitter. Do you think he's got the political management skills that are going to be called upon to hold this thing together. Because I think I think that's a real you know, if you think about just just look at the damage that Michael Gove did very subtly and sometimes less subtly to Liz Truss, But that was because he was on the outside. So, like, you bring in Theresa May as let's say he did bring her in as foreign secretary, that means you're getting rid of James Cleverley. He's gonna be offside.\n\nI think if he brings in some of the other people you mentioned, presumably, that means there's no place for Sona Braverman, no place for Steve Baker is currently ludicrously administering Northern Ireland. So these are huge problems that he's going to have to both solve and then create more problems.\n\nSpeaker 1: And this is one of the reasons why these big parties in the end have a sort of lifespan. They can't keep going. I mean, this is what, in a in a way, was one of the things that presumably began to be a bit of a problem for Gordon Brown as well that after you've been in office For a few years, you have had to throw quite a lot of senior people out of the cabinet. You've got quite a lot of younger people who are angry that they haven't been promoted. You can get away with that more easily In the 1st 5 years when you're on the honeymoon period.\n\nBut as years go on, you've got more and more people who feel that they're big beasts, who've been in the cabinet who are bitter about not being back in and more and more younger people who feel they're excluded. So you're absolutely right. There are some really impressive people out there. I would love a conservative party that had friend of mine called Damian Hines, who I think is a fantastic guy. I'd love to see him back in the cabinet, But trying to do that is gonna cause problems.\n\nAnd if you add to that, the factionalization at this point that I keep making that there are now Twelve different conservative parties. There's a kind of Singapore conservative party. There's a Jacob Rees Mogg conservative party, which is a sort of Victorian conservative party. There's the fragments for pro European conservative party. There's Steve Baker's Christian conservative party.\n\nAll these types of parties pushing in different directions.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is libertarians?\n\nSpeaker 1: There are the libertarians. There's the Liz Truss quasi court conservative party. You've noticed the Institute For Economic Affairs. You're great. Fravent, Tufton Street think tank out there saying the problem was that it wasn't implemented correctly.\n\nThey keep saying that these decisions, these economic decisions, were Absolutely fine. They just weren't implemented correctly, which is\n\nSpeaker 0: That's very Ben that is very Benite. Very Benite. Benite, isn't it? Yeah. We just socialist enough.\n\nYeah. Well, we'll see. We shall see. It's going to be very, very interesting to see how Rishi Sunak beds in, as you say, to see what his team is, who he surrounds himself with, and also how the Labour Party reacts to it and how the other parties as well. But, I just hope to god we have a general election sooner rather than later because I honestly, it's so nice to be in France, Roy.\n\nI know they've got massive problems at the moment, but it feels quite sort of stable and normal, and There's no fanaticism going around the place. How's Kenya?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Kenya's Kenya's got some trouble. I mean, we we should talk about this sometime. I mean, Africa in general is at the receiving end of all the horrors of the world. And as Britain and Europe and the United States hit economic problems and feel poorer. They're gonna be providing less and less assistance at exactly the moment when We need debt forgiveness here.\n\nWe need massive development programs. We need real sort about food security in Africa, Climate change. I mean, here in Kenya, I'm in a place where there's barely been any rain for 3 years. You can see all the cattle have got their bones sticking out of their flesh. I mean, it's It's pretty bleak, and that's much, much worse up in Somalia and Northern Kenya.\n\nSpeaker 0: But, Rory, I just wanna say, if you read volumes 1 to 8 of my diaries, you will find many accounts of me breaking into holidays to the annoyance of my family, and I do not recommend that you do it too often. So thank you for breaking into your holiday today. We've recorded this is the main podcast. We've recorded a q and a, which will be going out later in the week. We've recorded an interview with president Hollande.\n\nAnd tomorrow, I shall be flying solo, insisting that you have your holiday when I do an interview with the former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, which will be going out in the near future as well. So have a nice holiday, and, try not to worry about either the podcast ratings. They're doing very, very well, Rory. Not to worry. And or the future of the country, which is not doing quite as well.",
