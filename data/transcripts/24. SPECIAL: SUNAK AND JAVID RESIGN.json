But welcome to an edition of The Rest is Politics, which frankly, Rory and I weren't planning On doing, we've already recorded part of this week's output. But given what's happening in Westminster tonight with first the resignation of Sanjay Javed followed very, very quickly by the resignation Chancellor Rishi Sunak, I think it's fair to say that Boris Johnson is now in mortal peril. I'm very pleased to say that. I think he's the worst prime minister in history. He should never have been there. But I think it's going to be very, very, very hard for him to survive the loss of a chancellor And the former chancellor and I think you'd agree, Roy, that Sajid Javid, of all the cabinet actually, has probably managed to avoid falling into the Dominique Ra, Priti Patel, Nadeem Dorey's category of just being a kind of lapdog. He's somebody who does still have a bit of integrity. Oh, he does. And he's actually a a really likable guy. I mean, he's, in the leadership contest. He was the one of the out of Michael Gove and Dominic Raab and And Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, I mean, it was really such a jabber that I warmed to most. He's a genuinely kind colleague. He's thoughtful. It's got a really remarkable story. And remember, he already has resigned once from a Boris Johnson government. Yeah. He resigned in Dominic Cummings. Yeah. Resigned in fury because of what Dominic Cummings was doing. And Boris Johnson really pathetically failed to stand up for his chance for the exchequer against Dominic Cummings, who was at that stage Basically, trying to humiliate the chancellor and get rid of his staff. And I thought it was very good, Assange, to do it, and it's a big thing to do. I think people Forgetting politics that you take a big big risk when you resign because the chances are quite high that you you don't come back again. I mean, if you look at someone like Matt Hancock, He resigned, I guess, now a year and a half ago. He would have been desperate to get back, but the chances are it's gonna be tough for him to do that. So, and and Rishi Sunak, As I mean, maybe this is a chance to go to his letter, but I I noticed that he mentions in that letter that he thinks he understands this is a big risk, and it may be his last job in politics. But I think it's it's interesting. He he talks about you know, he says leaving ministerial office is a serious matter at any time for me to step down Down as chancellor, while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the panic, the the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, other challenges, a decision I've not taken lightly. I do imagine that These guys have genuinely wrestled with this. And also, Soonak, you know, he was one of the first to come out of the traps to say that Johnson unequivocally should be prime minister, he's a big backer of him on on on Brexit. But I think that there comes a point where people just feel that they can't defend the indefensible any longer. They've all defended the indefensible for far too long. I thought Dominic Raab on the airwaves this morning was just it was just it was it was Stomach churning to watch him, to try to pretend that what Johnson how Johnson had handled this sort of pincher, whatever his name is, this latest kind of scandal is somehow Defensible. What did you make of Javed's the tone of Javed's resignation? Well, it's it's it's an interesting letter. I mean, I think maybe we can come back to this a little bit. But one thing is that you you need to understand that these letters are quite carefully written. For sure. You they don't give the impression they've just been whipped off in 15 minutes. But, you know, the the key point in his letter, if people have a chance to read it, is he says, while I'm grateful for your continued trust and offer to continue in this role, I regret that I could not accept the conditions attached to the reappointment. It's crucial for the effectiveness of government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice as I've always sought to do. I also believe that it's important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you'd wish to be associated with. So, Actually, Sajid is, somebody who I remember in the cabinet was actually quite tough. I mean, he could be quite spoken and challenging. I remember him being quite challenging to Theresa May, and my sense is that that's really important for him, to be able to speak up. Remember, he's also unusual. And unlike Rishi Sunak, who came into politics pretty young, Sarajevid is unusual that having come in late, He was almost 40 when he came in. He'd had a very successful career at a very senior level running a big investment bank in Singapore. And so I think that there are a few others like that. I think Nadim Zahawi's a bit like that. Unusual people who, having had a quite a Serious big career running things for 20 years. There's a there's a limit to how much they're prepared to put up with. There's also a very political element to Rishi Sunak's Letter and an economic element as well. He says, I've always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagree with you privately, I've supported you publicly. That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies, and it's particularly important that the prime minister and the chancellor remain united in hard times such as those today. Our country is facing immense challenges. We both want a low tax, high growth economy, and world class public services. This can only be responsibly delivered If we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices, and take difficult decisions, I believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Oh, Our people know that if something is too good to be true, then it's not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it's not an easy one. And I in preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it's become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different. So I think that that is about His belief that Johnson actually just says what the audience wants to hear, splurges money, makes false promises, tells lies. And it's interesting what you said about how these letters are done. I mean, I've lost count of how many resignation letters and exchanges I was involved in the writing of. I remember when Robin Cook resigned, When I said, Robin, I think this is the first time that I've actually not written both the the ad the resume. And it was a joke, but he said, let's I can't wait to see whose diaries that appears at first. Sadly, because Robin died, it was in mine. But, so they are very, very carefully done. Number 10 will have tried to have get these toned down. They may even have succeeded. I just don't know. And it'll be interesting to see what Johnson says by way of reply. But I think the fact as well that, obviously, people now go to the all the other members of the cabinet and the fact that Wallace, Patel and Raab have, have have have, immediately confirmed that they're not leaving. That will make Johnson feel a little bit like he's gonna survive. But, You know, the truth the truth is day after day after day, this guy's authority is draining. He now has no credibility. He has few friends. And don't forget, the vote of no confidence, 75% of his backbenchers want him out. Yeah. So once the cabinet goes, I mean, he's totally he's from. Then let's just, to to zoom out for a moment and then come back into the question of Rishi and and Sajid and get into the details there. But if we zoom out for a second to resignation letters, I was just looking at this, Robin Cook letter. And what's striking about it is it's quite different to the type of letters which Rishi Senakh and Sartaj Javed have written. So Robin Cook is, of course, resigning about the Iraq war. And what he says is you and I have both made the case Over the years for an international order based on multilateral decisions through the UN and other forums. In principle, I believe it's wrong to embark on military action without broad international support in practice. I believe it's against Britain's interest to create a precedent for unilateral military action. Now that's an interesting difference, isn't it? Because He, there, is very, very clear. This is an in principle resignation on the issue of the Iraq war. That's not what's happening here with Sarajev Javid and Rishi Sunak, is it? With Sarajevid, he's basically saying, you don't listen to my advice. Mhmm. And Rishi Sunak is basically saying, as a chancellor, look. We need to be much more careful in our management to the public finances, and you are being reckless and profligate with the way that you do it. In other words, Actually, Rishi is almost a sort of classic conservative fiscal conservative as many people speaking for the treasury are. And his worry is that Boris Johnson is really gonna loosen the purse strings at the wrong time. Well, I wonder if I mean, we've said before, we've discussed on the podcast, Rishi Sunak's what we call his defenestration. And I do think that Johnson was involved in all that stuff about undermining Sunak, about the green card, and all that other stuff that we know about about 3,416 scandals ago. But I do think that what he's doing there is laying down a marker about the debate that will follow Johnson's departure, which is about what sort of Conservative Party Do you want? And therefore, I think what he's saying is, look, I've been completely done in. And I think that will become part of his argument. What they're not doing today It's saying, we can't work with a liar anymore. We can't work with somebody so incompetent. We can't work from somebody who just lurches from scandal to scandal and cover up to cover up. They're both finding, as Robin Cook did, but Robin Cooks, I think, was more honest. They're finding in in principle positions Because they will all have to answer the question, Rory. Every single one of them. You knew what he was like the whole time. Why did you put up with it for so long? That's what I'd like to ask both of them. But I do think soon that sees this is his his way back in, that it's principled. Yeah. It's about what sort of government they want. It's about conservative values. So I think the to to zoom out one more level, I think the other thing to understand is this is clearly, from both of them, A coordinated leadership pitch. Yeah. They have decided to lay down their mark on their running for the leadership. And They will have been looking for some time for the moment to move, and it's it's clearly coordinated. You you don't get 2 very carefully Written letters coming out within 15 minutes of each other, and you can see a hint of that actually in what Sarajevo says. He says in it, I would urge you to ensure the treasury As an institution retains as much credibility as possible. The team there has impressed me with the energy and intellect they've brought to delivering the shifts in policy. So he's basically teed up. He said, you know, I'm leaving, but the key thing here is you've gotta keep that treasury team intact. Oh, surprise, surprise. 5 minutes later, My friend, Rishi Sunak resigns from the treasury And should and should Rishi Sunak launch a leadership bid, and should Rishi Sunak become the leader of the conservative party, who better than somebody who knows the Treasury from the inside having been chanced with the checkup until the previous resignation by Sajid Javid. I get all that and I think that I think that's right. I think they'll be very disappointed if there aren't other suit if you follow suit. Whether they know that there will be Yeah. Well, I think it's really dangerous, isn't it? I mean, if we now go back to this stuff because, You know, I I remember this plotting, a loss against Theresa May who lost a lot of people. It's very difficult coordinating. Famously, when David Davis resigned from Theresa May's government over Brexit. He tried to persuade Boris Johnson to come with him, and Boris Johnson agonized for 2 or 3 days before doing it. And, Actually, after the event, about 3 months later, Boris Johnson was standing in a corridor, and one of my colleagues went up to him. He'd been given a miserable office by the whips in Port Cullors House, A humiliating comedown from being foreign secretary. Boris looked completely Boris Johnson looked completely ashen faced. And he said, My one advice he said to his new MP is never ever resign. Now, of course, in Boris Johnson's case, it paid off. In the end, after months of thinking he'd done the wrong thing, It put him in the position to then run as the outside count against leadership. So I think it's it's if they're gonna do it, It's a good move, but but let's just go back one stage too. It's fascinating that they've done it over this. Well, it's a sort it's the tip but it's the tipping point. It's the tipping point theory, presumably. It's like they see the authority draining. And I think they probably do think we said we you know, in the podcast that we recorded earlier today, some of which will now presumably go in the cutting room floor. But we said that there comes a point where, surely, people who've got decent Families and friends, where they come to a point saying, look, are you seriously going to keep traipsing around the studios defending this guy? There comes that point, surely. And Dominique Raab Dominique Raab, to me, was extraordinary this morning. I mean, it was just embarrassing to watch him. Well, so let's let's I mean, I think the other thing that probably went on the cutting Floris, we were talking about this about whether somebody like Boris Johnson ever voluntarily leaves. And I was saying that, actually, my experience back in the day in Indonesia with Suharto, who'd been a dictator for 32 years. Who people thought would hold out at the last moment is eventually he did go as his cabinet collapsed around him. And Boris Johnson may, In the end, have to throw in the towel. But but listen, these guys, and here's another point. Rishi Sunak is very close to Oliver Dowden, who was the chairman of the conservative party who resigned over the Tiverton by election very recently now. And there, they would have hoped to coordinate, and they didn't quite. So I wonder Whether actually this letter wasn't waiting, that Oliver Dowden wasn't begging Rishi to come with him, whatever it is, 2 weeks ago now. And Rishi Sunak wasn't quite prepared to do it then because this particular thing, I mean, just just go for that Chris Pincher, is extraordinary. I mean, You're gone. Tell us a little bit about Fiona's insight into what happens in the Carlton Club again. Fiona's Fiona claims to know The inside the Carlton Club, there is something called Cad's Corner where Cad's I mean, I've never been inside the Carlton Club. It's riddled with the services, like, like, like, rising damp and rotting. There'll be rats running all over the place, I imagine. But, yeah, Pincher's clearly, you know, a pincher by name, a pincher by nature is apparently what Johnson used to say to them. And it is incredible. Just think of it. The guy has a record The they call it inappropriate behavior. They mean sexual abuse and sexual assault. So what what do we think he actually I mean, sorry. This is a pretty vulgar conversation, but What do you think he actually does to someone fully dressed in in a London club in their Well, he obviously tries to touch their Private story tries to stroke them in parts of their body they don't want to be touched, or maybe they do want to be touched. I don't know. I'm not a conservative. I've never been in the casting club. As I say, It could be some great orgy that goes on there every night for all I know. But what I do know is that Johnson knew that. That is what was clear from Simon Macdonald today, and yet appointed this guy as the person to whom MPs should go and report if they felt they were being sexually or inappropriately abused. I mean, it's just incredible. That alone he should resign for. It is incredible. But I also think I wanna make the case to you that Rory, don't make the case for the groper. Do not make the case for the groper. It will not end well. Whatever happened to your school, Whatever went there, just do not go there. Okay. The case I wanna make is that what Chris Pincher did was clearly completely unacceptable, Very disturbing to people, and quite rightly, he resigned and has been thrown out. But remember that Boris Johnson has done things on a a more horrifying scale. For sure. Constitutionally lying to parliament, proroguing parliament, Trying to undo the entire lobbying rules in parliament. He he's also Rory, he's also a well known sexual abuser. You know, Sharna Edwards wrote that piece about how she was sitting at dinner And felt this hand grabbing flesh on her thigh later discovered that he was doing exactly the same thing at the same time to the woman on the other side of him. The guy's a disgusting human being, as you say, in men's men's health magazine this week. Well, he's evil. In a sense, it's sort of almost fitting. There's a sort of a kind of tragic Comic fittingness that it should be pincher the pincher that brings him down. That that it it because you remember there's that great phrase in Marx where he says, History repeats itself. You know, 2nd time has fast that Mhmm. There's something about Rose Johnson. He's so profoundly both disgusting and nonserious But in a way, it's sort of fitting that in the end, he he disintegrates in a shambolic, kinda shameful, humiliating minor thing. Roy, that's that's wonderful analysis. But what damage is being done to the country meanwhile? It's enormous. And I think some of it's irreparable. I really do. And who the hell is he gonna make chancellor? I mean, I I suspect Nadine Dorries is going to be appointed chancellor and health secretary as, you know, because she and and in the end, it'll just be the 2 of them sitting at the cabinet table with Dominic Raab maybe just coming in for a you know, to pour the tea. Okay. Let's take a quick break. When we return, we'll discuss the outcome for Boris Johnson. Can he survive? Let's hope not. So So welcome back. Part 2 of this special episode of The Rest is Politics with me, Alastair Campbell. And with me, Rory Stewart. And and listen, just a small thing that Listeners won't necessarily understand, which is that Alastair does this stuff, does these takes because he is the more experienced broadcaster. You hear it? So as Harry kind of said, he's got some very rich voice. He's gonna be doing the Today program soon. No. It's and and and I mean, I do hope when When the rest of the week's episodes are put out, I do hope that they don't edit out the question from Gemma Telford about my voice. I like that question, Roy. I I listen. This is an important episode, but I also want to encourage people to listen to the us because we also get Alastair doing Elvis Presley. I thought very well, actually. I love it. Thank you. That was good. That was good. Well, I I love Elvis. What about so, I mean, do you see any circumstances now in you you've been You said we had a bet. Do you remember, Rory? We had a bet quite recently. You said Boris Johnson will lead the trawlers into the next election. When when are you gonna pay me? Well, I I think I'm gonna pay you very soon, and not just you. But this is something in my defense that I always do because I I love betting against what I want because I'm very happy to pay you as much money as you like. I'll take 3,000,000 plus I'll take 3,000,000 plus That's that's to have the to have the delight of Boris Johnson going. I I I it's makes me so happy. And and the other way, you see, is if I'm in the really unlucky position, he the next election, then I get something from you. So the whole thing is it's kind of win win, isn't it? I do you think he do you think he's gonna be able to make it To the end of the month? End of the week? I I I think it's very, very hard to work out. It's very, very hard to work out. I've just been looking through the odds. For some reason, Penny Morton seems to be the favorite, but I don't know I don't buy that. Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Ben and Melissa. I don't think any of that's right. I think if they had any sense at all I know Sunak and Javed have put themselves into an interesting position, but I really do think they'd be wise to to go to the backbenchers. I think there are some very strong people on their backbenchers, and they'd be wise to go there. Because this cabinet is now completely tainted. Totally tainted. Definite definitely. If you were if you were Tom Tooganhurst or Jeremy Hunt running, that would be your run, wouldn't You would say, I didn't touch this guy's cabinet. I had nothing to do with it, and I warned you guys. The the problem is, of course, that, tonally, That's pretty difficult because if everybody else is implicated, they don't want you coming they're not gonna vote for somebody who comes across. Remember, Just remind listeners that the 1st round of the voting is just the MPs. The other conservative MPs have to put you on the final 2. Mhmm. And If they've all been compromised and they're all feeling a bit shitty about it, they're not gonna want somebody who comes across as holier than thou. So If Tom Tucano and Jeremy Hunt are running, they have to be pretty careful not to give the impression that they think everybody who serves in Boris Johnson's government Yeah. It's a it's a moral minion. But also the the the the other thing that I think is, you know, worth pointing out in this is that the The politics of the parliamentary conservative party are still very dominated by the right wing, the ERG, the kind of crazy right wing stuff, which I think that Sunak is trying to appeal to in his letter. So I think that will be harder for something like Touken Hout or Jeremy Hunt. You've got to win over those Maddy or ERG guys. So the the odds are also really interesting. So the the, has got Penny Mordent at 11 to 2. Liz Truss at 36 to 5. These are sort of stupid ways of doing it. Jeremy Hunt, 38 to 5. Rishi Sunak, 8 to 1. Ben Wallace, 8 to 1. Nadim Zahavi, 10 to 1. Tom Tuchenhardt, 10 to 1. And Sarit Javid, 20 to 1. Now what's interesting about that is that all those odds are quite long. When I was running to be, the leader against Boris Johnson, as we were getting at the end, I was 5 to 1, and Boris was flipped the other way around. So you'd bet, 5 pounds £5 to get £2, I think, is where he was. So it shows it shows that the race is very different from that 2019 race. Those odds though, Rory, I'm surprised you read those odds and and and name checked whilst checking. Because what the bookies do in these situations is they try to get media attention. And then people will bet on. So pretty penny that either means that somebody has suddenly put on a very, very, very large bet on Penny Morton. That is possible. Which could be her mom? It could be her. It could be her best friend. It could be one of her Russian donors. You know? I don't know. She has Russian donors, but most conservatives do. So I think that, But, you know, look, my son, as you know, works in gambling. The there's the there's a lot of odds movement goes on and the shift to give money. So, yeah, I think it's interesting. I do think Penny Morton's quite interesting. She's always stood out from Johnson. She's not sort of and I think it would be smart for them to go for a moment. I think if they pick if they pick Les Truss As their leader, I think Keir Starmer can pretty much go to the beach. Now there are some people who think that Keir Starmer goes to the beach too much, but and in a metaphorical sort of way. But I do think this trust will be absolutely, totally destroyable in by Labour in a way that Johnson ultimately is being destroyed by reality and by himself and by the conservatives. Do you think Rishi Sunak Could win. I mean, you I know you came across you thought he came across as quite thin skinned was one of your phrases, wasn't it? I think he's I think he he's obviously been damaged very, very badly by this whole episode. I think the wealth Just just remind listeners on that episode because Well, basically, stuff started to come out that he's you know, that there was a lack of clarity about his particularly his wife's tax affairs and also the fact that he was administering her majesty's government whilst having a green card, which is essentially 1 step away from American citizenship. And I think that was probably briefed against him. I mean, he's come through that reasonably well. And and and and I you know, I tried to defend them at the time. I'd like to defend them even more. Do you know, actually, a remarkable number of MPs have, dual citizenship? Actually, the peep there were there are MPs, who are American citizens. There are many MPs who are Pakistani citizens. There are many, many MPs with Irish passports. So I was a bit surprised I was a bit surprised that the the green card was held against him so hard. I think well, I think I think, to be honest, I think it's the it's the it's the it's the sheer wealth that maybe is held against him, but I don't think that's on its own is enough to bring him down. The the point I made about thin skin was something that I kept hearing from people at the treasury. They said he's just not very good at the sort of, you You know, a bit like Rory Stewart, he sometimes needs to toughen up a bit. But he's clearly toughened up sufficient to sort of, you know, pull the carpet from under Johnson tonight. Which is a tough thing to do. Really, really big move. And and I think Rory, just got you're just getting back to what you were saying earlier about the domino effect or not. I remember, do you remember when James Purnell Resign from Gordon Brown's cabinet. Yep. I do. And and Gordon immediately, ran a pretty effective, pretty military operation. Peter Mandelson was involved as well to get everybody to come out straight away and say we're not following. And and and and it it sort of didn't go anywhere. It did undermine authority, But Gordon did still sort of survive to the next election. But I think there's something different about a chancellor and a former chancellor acting in unison like this. You and and who is he? Who do you think he will make as chancellor? Who will he put there? So, he could put in I I'd put a always look at his, his Chief Sexley Treasury says Simon Clark might get promoted. I think, Or Barkley? He could look, Yeah. He could look at Barclay. He could look at Liz Truss. She's always wanted to be chancellor. The person who really wants the job and hasn't resigned yet, but he'll never make chancellor, It's Michael Gove because I think he just doesn't trust Michael Gove. What about Zahawi? What about Zahawi? Well, Nadim Nadim is I think he's a he's somebody I like. I mean, he's very I I, you know, I'm always been impressed with him. I I traveled with him a bit during the breakout. When ISIS took Mosul, David Cameron, sent Nadim and myself off to talk to people in Iraq, and He was a really great traveling. He's funny. He's modest. I've heard good things about him actually from his civil servants in education. I wish you I wish you'd get a decent education policy, though. I don't know what the government's education policy is. Yeah. Well, I mean, we know what your education policy would be, wouldn't it? Yes. And if that's why I'm Becky Javed, state schoolboy. Well, your list trust is a state schoolperson as well, so is Oliver Dowden. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and and and and, you know, nodding Doris very much so. I mean, I think it's yeah. It's, listen. Here's another interesting one I got. Simon Hawr, who's, a you know, he's he's he's on the left of the left the party, but but rather a good tweet came out from him. He's he sometimes pulls his punches a bit. But Katie Ball said prime minister touring the tea room, talking of an interview morning. Number 10 trying to calm the ship after mood has continued to worsen. And Simon Haw tweeted out, been there, done that, Purchase the T shirt. I'm sorry. I will listen. I will learn, then joke behind closed doors. I don't see any problem, etcetera. It won't wash anymore. That tactical ship has sailed and sunk. Good old Simon. Is he still the chairman of the Northern Ireland slate? He is. Yes. Yes. Well, I bet I suspect he spends all his time talking to politicians in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, and he knows the damage this guy is doing in Northern Ireland, and he's probably had enough of it. Julia Knight, good one. When you have an individual of the caliber of my friends, Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak saying enough is enough, then I'm afraid the die is cast. It's Time for the party to take a new direction. So some of this will be organized, remember. I mean, I I can't emphasize enough how having touched the edge of these leadership campaigns, These guys, by which I means, Rishi Sunak Sajid Javid, would have had their donors lined up for months. They would have been quietly building their teams for months. Do you think Javid's going to run possibly as a running mate with Sunak? I think he I think big temptation to run as a running mate, But also a temptation to see if he won't go for it themselves. And often, they won't decide till the last moment. But on this, a lot of the MPs tweeting out for them Would have been prepped in advance. So it's it's quite possible, for example, that some of these guys were set up to go out to us in advance. The other thing is, I don't know if you noticed, Boris was about to make a press statement at 6, and these things broke. No. He said it. He did it. His his his press statement was to say that he made a mistake in Appointing, pincher. Uh-huh. But I think that that, I and I think that's what triggered the a big thing went around. He's making a statement. I guess Soon Haak and Javi will probably say, well, is he gonna resign? They don't. He's gonna say it was a mistake. Well, we do that anyway. Bang out the letters. No. That was that was that was part of the kind of and this is the other thing about Downing Street. I mean, they're so incompetent. They can't do they can't do anything. What did they ever do that worked? 6 one one of one of the problems, it says he continuing to sort of kick these people, is remember In an earlier thing, we talked about the appointment of Steve Barclay, and I said, it's ridiculous. The chief of staff in Downing Street is a full time job. Yeah. And Steve Barclay is doing it while being a constituency MP and actually a constituency that's quite Cambridge are quite a long way from London. And, also, he's doing it while being a minister. It just doesn't work. I mean, that is a 20 four seven job. How many scandals ago was it that John Johnson's response was that he's going to put in a new team to professionalize the operation? They he can't do it. He's morally incapable. He's practically incapable. Well, that that that'll be the problem for Steve Buckley, to be fair. I mean, Steve is a competent guy. He he was was in the private sector, runs things well, was briefly in the army. He's a competent guy, but you cannot manage Boris Johnson. Even if Steve Buckley was doing it full time, which he's not, You can't manage him because as as I mean, as Simon Macdonald found in in the front office, we would I think it's one of the things that triggered this actually is Simon Macdonald, who both you and I know well, Sending in a very, very extraordinary clear letter pointing out the lies that were told about Chris Pincher. But but Watching all these people try to manage Boris Johnson. I mean, the only person who kind of did it was a man called sir Simon Milton who was his chief of staff in London. And it may be something to do with the London mayoral job, which Boris Johnson played as a kind of ceremonial mascot. You know? Largely, it was about being frozen on a zipline waving a couple of miniature flags and getting stuck. And he let Eddie Lister and and Simon Milton get on with doing the property deals and all that kind of stuff. But running the country just doesn't work like that. No. And also the other thing that I you know, when you talk to people who were in the assembly at the time that, Johnson was mayor, They didn't they did spot that he had this inability to to check out facts, duty, detail, and tell the truth. And, again, It's a different level to be prime minister, to being London mayor or even chancellor of the exchequer. You're exposed in a different way. And even with the slavish backing of Lord Daker and Lord Murdoch and Lord all the others that all the sort of, you know, media barons that still you know, it'd be interesting what they do tomorrow. I think they've been sort of blowing with the wind as well. But I think that, you know, this is the thing that people have to take out of this. You should not put into really serious positions in government people who are fundamentally not Sirius. He is not a serious person. And and I think it's really shameful that it happened at all. I mean, I think this is where I guess I'm still a little unforgiving towards people like Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden, who who really hard and in a really important way when he's running for leadership. And I remember those conversations saying to colleagues in fact, actually, towards the end, I was saying, why don't you Vote for Sarajid Javid. Why don't you vote for Jeremy Hunt? And people saying, well, Boris is gonna win. And I'd say, but he's completely Incapable of doing this. I mean, I remember saying this to Grant Shapps, who was one of his big backers. I said, look. I've worked with him in the foreign office. I've seen Absolutely up close and personal month after month that he cannot be trusted to do the simplest thing, that he will Completely screw up our policy with Kenya in a single phone call. He will take no interest at all. He'll he'll launch Libya policy without noticing, we don't have an embassy active in Libya. We can't have him as prime minister. But the answer was always, yeah, but he can win. And Well, he can't win now. He can't win now. He can't win. Now, Rory, we're going to have to, I don't know if our listeners know, but Gary Lineker's day job, he he basically edits. You know, he decides what the graphics are and, you know, he just loves his podcast so much. And he's now going to have to spend all night cutting out those bits of the podcast we've already recorded that are now being superseded by what we've said just now. But there's 1 and and then then on Later in the week, we will do the question and answer session as well. But I want to trail that with one of the questions which I just spotted from the princess of Yorkshire. And she obviously was, was was ahead of Sunak and Javid. She said, do you think that we will need a truth and reconciliation process once Johnson is gone? It's Pretty good question, isn't it? Very good question. We're we're pretty close to that, aren't we? And and as you say, the damage is semipermanent. I mean, it's so so sad, So sad to see someone so incapable of government. Well, for me for me, the biggest symbol of that remains Brexit. I mean, the fact is that Brexit would not have happened without Boris Johnson. Brexit would not have happened without Dominic Cummings. The people who delivered Brexit, are proven liars, proven cheats. In Johnson's case, he talks about having a 3rd term in office. Frankly, I will not rest until he's serving his 1st term in prison for misconduct in public office. As you know, Rory, I don't believe we should be filling the presence with, with with with with petty crimes. But he is not a petty criminal. He's a major crook. So I would like to reach out to those listeners who voted for Brexit, If there are any left after your after your your cards and say, look. This this is The the tragedy of this is this goes so much deeper than that single issue. I mean, he has just corroded our constitution. Rule of law, judiciary, media. It's so sad. I mean, he's everything that will follow on from this. And maybe we'll learn an important lesson. Maybe we'll end up with proportional representation. We'll end up with the constitution. Yeah. We'll sort these things out. Maybe we'll separate our executive from our legislature. Maybe the parties will collapse. But Goodness gracious me. It feels like the end of the Roman Empire. I mean, he feels like one of those very strange I mean, that's one of the odd things about him. He's a guy who It's completely also oddly. He's he was obviously a clever young child. Right? He was able Doing exams when he was 12, 13. But somewhere along this time and I don't know when he was, maybe 14 or 15 or something. He just stopped thinking. You can't actually have a serious conversation with him about anything. He gets bored within about 10 seconds. I know. Funny enough, I was with somebody today on this pro this TV program I told you about, make me prime minister. And they said, I don't think he's very clever, you know. I think he's he's had a very expensive education, but I don't think he's very clever. I thought it was quite an insightful comment. Thank you for joining us for our Rest is Politics special. There will be a regular episode on Thursday in which we discuss labor and Brexit, China, Taiwan, the economy, and the new Elvis Presley film. But tonight, Britain's tumultuous politics has offered yet another dramatic development. Boris Johnson is on the brink, and hopefully, before too long, We'll be saying goodbye to him just as we're saying goodbye now to you. Goodbye from me too.",

To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show tickets. Just go to the rest is politics.com. That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nBut welcome to an edition of The Rest is Politics, which frankly, Rory and I weren't planning On doing, we've already recorded part of this week's output. But given what's happening in Westminster tonight with first the resignation of Sanjay Javed followed very, very quickly by the resignation Chancellor Rishi Sunak, I think it's fair to say that Boris Johnson is now in mortal peril. I'm very pleased to say that. I think he's the worst prime minister in history. He should never have been there.\n\nBut I think it's going to be very, very, very hard for him to survive the loss of a chancellor And the former chancellor and I think you'd agree, Roy, that Sajid Javid, of all the cabinet actually, has probably managed to avoid falling into the Dominique Ra, Priti Patel, Nadeem Dorey's category of just being a kind of lapdog. He's somebody who does still have a bit of integrity.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, he does. And he's actually a a really likable guy. I mean, he's, in the leadership contest. He was the one of the out of Michael Gove and Dominic Raab and And Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, I mean, it was really such a jabber that I warmed to most. He's a genuinely kind colleague.\n\nHe's thoughtful. It's got a really remarkable story. And remember, he already has resigned once from a Boris Johnson government.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. He resigned in Dominic Cummings.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Resigned in fury because of what Dominic Cummings was doing. And Boris Johnson really pathetically failed to stand up for his chance for the exchequer against Dominic Cummings, who was at that stage Basically, trying to humiliate the chancellor and get rid of his staff. And I thought it was very good, Assange, to do it, and it's a big thing to do. I think people Forgetting politics that you take a big big risk when you resign because the chances are quite high that you you don't come back again.\n\nI mean, if you look at someone like Matt Hancock, He resigned, I guess, now a year and a half ago. He would have been desperate to get back, but the chances are it's gonna be tough for him to do that. So, and and Rishi Sunak, As I mean, maybe this is a chance to go to his letter, but I I noticed that he mentions in that letter that he thinks he understands this is a big risk, and it may be his last job in politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I think it's it's interesting. He he talks about you know, he says leaving ministerial office is a serious matter at any time for me to step down Down as chancellor, while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the panic, the the pandemic, the war in Ukraine, other challenges, a decision I've not taken lightly. I do imagine that These guys have genuinely wrestled with this. And also, Soonak, you know, he was one of the first to come out of the traps to say that Johnson unequivocally should be prime minister, he's a big backer of him on on on Brexit. But I think that there comes a point where people just feel that they can't defend the indefensible any longer.\n\nThey've all defended the indefensible for far too long. I thought Dominic Raab on the airwaves this morning was just it was just it was it was Stomach churning to watch him, to try to pretend that what Johnson how Johnson had handled this sort of pincher, whatever his name is, this latest kind of scandal is somehow Defensible. What did you make of Javed's the tone of Javed's resignation?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's it's an interesting letter. I mean, I think maybe we can come back to this a little bit. But one thing is that you you need to understand that these letters are quite carefully written.\n\nSpeaker 0: For sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: You they don't give the impression they've just been whipped off in 15 minutes. But, you know, the the key point in his letter, if people have a chance to read it, is he says, while I'm grateful for your continued trust and offer to continue in this role, I regret that I could not accept the conditions attached to the reappointment. It's crucial for the effectiveness of government that you have people around you who can give you clear and candid advice as I've always sought to do. I also believe that it's important as leaders to have trusted teams that reflect the character and integrity that you'd wish to be associated with. So, Actually, Sajid is, somebody who I remember in the cabinet was actually quite tough.\n\nI mean, he could be quite spoken and challenging. I remember him being quite challenging to Theresa May, and my sense is that that's really important for him, to be able to speak up. Remember, he's also unusual. And unlike Rishi Sunak, who came into politics pretty young, Sarajevid is unusual that having come in late, He was almost 40 when he came in. He'd had a very successful career at a very senior level running a big investment bank in Singapore.\n\nAnd so I think that there are a few others like that. I think Nadim Zahawi's a bit like that. Unusual people who, having had a quite a Serious big career running things for 20 years. There's a there's a limit to how much they're prepared to put up with.\n\nSpeaker 0: There's also a very political element to Rishi Sunak's Letter and an economic element as well. He says, I've always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagree with you privately, I've supported you publicly. That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies, and it's particularly important that the prime minister and the chancellor remain united in hard times such as those today. Our country is facing immense challenges.\n\nWe both want a low tax, high growth economy, and world class public services. This can only be responsibly delivered If we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices, and take difficult decisions, I believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Oh, Our people know that if something is too good to be true, then it's not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it's not an easy one. And I in preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it's become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different.\n\nSo I think that that is about His belief that Johnson actually just says what the audience wants to hear, splurges money, makes false promises, tells lies. And it's interesting what you said about how these letters are done. I mean, I've lost count of how many resignation letters and exchanges I was involved in the writing of. I remember when Robin Cook resigned, When I said, Robin, I think this is the first time that I've actually not written both the the ad the resume. And it was a joke, but he said, let's I can't wait to see whose diaries that appears at first.\n\nSadly, because Robin died, it was in mine. But, so they are very, very carefully done. Number 10 will have tried to have get these toned down. They may even have succeeded. I just don't know.\n\nAnd it'll be interesting to see what Johnson says by way of reply. But I think the fact as well that, obviously, people now go to the all the other members of the cabinet and the fact that Wallace, Patel and Raab have, have have have, immediately confirmed that they're not leaving. That will make Johnson feel a little bit like he's gonna survive. But, You know, the truth the truth is day after day after day, this guy's authority is draining. He now has no credibility.\n\nHe has few friends. And don't forget, the vote of no confidence, 75% of his backbenchers want him out. Yeah. So once the cabinet goes, I mean, he's\n\nSpeaker 1: totally he's from. Then let's just, to to zoom out for a moment and then come back into the question of Rishi and and Sajid and get into the details there. But if we zoom out for a second to resignation letters, I was just looking at this, Robin Cook letter. And what's striking about it is it's quite different to the type of letters which Rishi Senakh and Sartaj Javed have written. So Robin Cook is, of course, resigning about the Iraq war.\n\nAnd what he says is you and I have both made the case Over the years for an international order based on multilateral decisions through the UN and other forums. In principle, I believe it's wrong to embark on military action without broad international support in practice. I believe it's against Britain's interest to create a precedent for unilateral military action. Now that's an interesting difference, isn't it? Because He, there, is very, very clear.\n\nThis is an in principle resignation on the issue of the Iraq war. That's not what's happening here with Sarajev Javid and Rishi Sunak, is it? With Sarajevid, he's basically saying, you don't listen to my advice.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Rishi Sunak is basically saying, as a chancellor, look. We need to be much more careful in our management to the public finances, and you are being reckless and profligate with the way that you do it. In other words, Actually, Rishi is almost a sort of classic conservative fiscal conservative as many people speaking for the treasury are. And his worry is that Boris Johnson is really gonna loosen the purse strings at the wrong time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I wonder if I mean, we've said before, we've discussed on the podcast, Rishi Sunak's what we call his defenestration. And I do think that Johnson was involved in all that stuff about undermining Sunak, about the green card, and all that other stuff that we know about about 3,416 scandals ago. But I do think that what he's doing there is laying down a marker about the debate that will follow Johnson's departure, which is about what sort of Conservative Party Do you want? And therefore, I think what he's saying is, look, I've been completely done in. And I think that will become part of his argument.\n\nWhat they're not doing today It's saying, we can't work with a liar anymore. We can't work with somebody so incompetent. We can't work from somebody who just lurches from scandal to scandal and cover up to cover up. They're both finding, as Robin Cook did, but Robin Cooks, I think, was more honest. They're finding in in principle positions Because they will all have to answer the question, Rory.\n\nEvery single one of them. You knew what he was like the whole time. Why did you put up with it for so long? That's what I'd like to ask both of them. But I do think soon that sees this is his his way back in, that it's principled.\n\nYeah. It's about what sort of government they want. It's about conservative values.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think the to to zoom out one more level, I think the other thing to understand is this is clearly, from both of them, A coordinated leadership pitch. Yeah. They have decided to lay down their mark on their running for the leadership. And They will have been looking for some time for the moment to move, and it's it's clearly coordinated. You you don't get 2 very carefully Written letters coming out within 15 minutes of each other, and you can see a hint of that actually in what Sarajevo says.\n\nHe says in it, I would urge you to ensure the treasury As an institution retains as much credibility as possible. The team there has impressed me with the energy and intellect they've brought to delivering the shifts in policy. So he's basically teed up. He said, you know, I'm leaving, but the key thing here is you've gotta keep that treasury team intact. Oh, surprise, surprise.\n\n5 minutes later, My friend, Rishi Sunak resigns from the treasury\n\nSpeaker 0: And should and should Rishi Sunak launch a leadership bid, and should Rishi Sunak become the leader of the conservative party, who better than somebody who knows the Treasury from the inside having been chanced with the checkup until the previous resignation by Sajid Javid. I get all that and I think that I think that's right. I think they'll be very disappointed if there aren't other suit if you follow suit. Whether they know that there will be Yeah. Well, I think\n\nSpeaker 1: it's really dangerous, isn't it? I mean, if we now go back to this stuff because, You know, I I remember this plotting, a loss against Theresa May who lost a lot of people. It's very difficult coordinating. Famously, when David Davis resigned from Theresa May's government over Brexit. He tried to persuade Boris Johnson to come with him, and Boris Johnson agonized for 2 or 3 days before doing it.\n\nAnd, Actually, after the event, about 3 months later, Boris Johnson was standing in a corridor, and one of my colleagues went up to him. He'd been given a miserable office by the whips in Port Cullors House, A humiliating comedown from being foreign secretary. Boris looked completely Boris Johnson looked completely ashen faced. And he said, My one advice he said to his new MP is never ever resign. Now, of course, in Boris Johnson's case, it paid off.\n\nIn the end, after months of thinking he'd done the wrong thing, It put him in the position to then run as the outside count against leadership. So I think it's it's if they're gonna do it, It's a good move, but but let's just go back one stage too. It's fascinating that they've done it over this.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it's a sort it's the tip but it's the tipping point. It's the tipping point theory, presumably. It's like they see the authority draining. And I think they probably do think we said we you know, in the podcast that we recorded earlier today, some of which will now presumably go in the cutting room floor. But we said that there comes a point where, surely, people who've got decent Families and friends, where they come to a point saying, look, are you seriously going to keep traipsing around the studios defending this guy?\n\nThere comes that point, surely. And Dominique Raab Dominique Raab, to me, was extraordinary this morning. I mean, it was just embarrassing to watch him.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so let's let's I mean, I think the other thing that probably went on the cutting Floris, we were talking about this about whether somebody like Boris Johnson ever voluntarily leaves. And I was saying that, actually, my experience back in the day in Indonesia with Suharto, who'd been a dictator for 32 years. Who people thought would hold out at the last moment is eventually he did go as his cabinet collapsed around him. And Boris Johnson may, In the end, have to throw in the towel. But but listen, these guys, and here's another point.\n\nRishi Sunak is very close to Oliver Dowden, who was the chairman of the conservative party who resigned over the Tiverton by election very recently now. And there, they would have hoped to coordinate, and they didn't quite. So I wonder Whether actually this letter wasn't waiting, that Oliver Dowden wasn't begging Rishi to come with him, whatever it is, 2 weeks ago now. And Rishi Sunak wasn't quite prepared to do it then because this particular thing, I mean, just just go for that Chris Pincher, is extraordinary. I mean, You're gone.\n\nTell us a little bit about Fiona's insight into what happens in the Carlton Club again.\n\nSpeaker 0: Fiona's Fiona claims to know The inside the Carlton Club, there is something called Cad's Corner where Cad's I mean, I've never been inside the Carlton Club. It's riddled with the services,\n\nSpeaker 1: like, like, like, rising\n\nSpeaker 0: damp and rotting. There'll be rats running all over the place, I imagine. But, yeah, Pincher's clearly, you know, a pincher by name, a pincher by nature is apparently what Johnson used to say to them. And it is incredible. Just think of it.\n\nThe guy has a record The they call it inappropriate behavior. They mean sexual abuse and sexual assault.\n\nSpeaker 1: So what what do we think he actually I mean, sorry. This is a pretty vulgar conversation, but What do you think he actually does to someone fully dressed in in a London club in their Well,\n\nSpeaker 0: he obviously tries to touch their Private story tries to stroke them in parts of their body they don't want to be touched, or maybe they do want to be touched. I don't know. I'm not a conservative. I've never been in the casting club. As I say, It could be some great orgy that goes on there every night for all I know.\n\nBut what I do know is that Johnson knew that. That is what was clear from Simon Macdonald today, and yet appointed this guy as the person to whom MPs should go and report if they felt they were being sexually or inappropriately abused. I mean, it's just incredible. That alone he should resign for.\n\nSpeaker 1: It is incredible. But I also think I wanna make the case to you that\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory, don't make the case for the groper. Do not make the case for the groper. It will not end well. Whatever happened to your school, Whatever went there, just do not go there.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The case I wanna make is that what Chris Pincher did was clearly completely unacceptable, Very disturbing to people, and quite rightly, he resigned and has been thrown out. But remember that Boris Johnson has done things on a a more horrifying scale.\n\nSpeaker 0: For sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Constitutionally lying to parliament, proroguing parliament, Trying to undo the entire lobbying rules in parliament.\n\nSpeaker 0: He he's also Rory, he's also a well known sexual abuser. You know, Sharna Edwards wrote that piece about how she was sitting at dinner And felt this hand grabbing flesh on her thigh later discovered that he was doing exactly the same thing at the same time to the woman on the other side of him. The guy's a disgusting human being, as you say, in men's men's health magazine this week. Well, he's evil.\n\nSpeaker 1: In a sense, it's sort of almost fitting. There's a sort of a kind of tragic Comic fittingness that it should be pincher the pincher that brings him down. That that it it because you remember there's that great phrase in Marx where he says, History repeats itself. You know, 2nd time has fast that Mhmm. There's something about Rose Johnson.\n\nHe's so profoundly both disgusting and nonserious But in a way, it's sort of fitting that in the end, he he disintegrates in a shambolic, kinda shameful, humiliating minor thing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Roy, that's that's wonderful analysis. But what damage is being done to the country meanwhile? It's enormous. And I think some of it's irreparable. I really do.\n\nAnd who the hell is he gonna make chancellor? I mean, I I suspect Nadine Dorries is going to be appointed chancellor and health secretary as, you know, because she and and in the end, it'll just be the 2 of them sitting at the cabinet table with Dominic Raab maybe just coming in for a you know, to pour the tea. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's take a quick break. When we return, we'll discuss the outcome for Boris Johnson. Can he survive?\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's hope not. So So welcome back. Part 2 of this special episode of The Rest is Politics with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with me, Rory Stewart. And and listen, just a small thing that Listeners won't necessarily understand, which is that Alastair does this stuff, does these takes because he is the more experienced broadcaster. You hear it? So as Harry kind of said, he's got some very rich voice. He's gonna be doing the Today program soon.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. It's and and and I mean, I do hope when When the rest of the week's episodes are put out, I do hope that they don't edit out the question from Gemma Telford about my voice. I like that question, Roy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I listen. This is an important episode, but I also want to encourage people to listen to the us because we also get Alastair doing Elvis Presley. I thought very well, actually.\n\nSpeaker 0: I love it. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was good. That was good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I love Elvis. What about so, I mean, do you see any circumstances now in you you've been You said we had a bet. Do you remember, Rory? We had a bet quite recently. You said Boris Johnson will lead the trawlers into the next election.\n\nWhen when are you gonna pay me?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I think I'm gonna pay you very soon, and not just you. But this is something in my defense that I always do because I I love betting against what I want because I'm very happy to pay you as much money as you like.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll take 3,000,000 plus I'll take 3,000,000 plus That's that's to have the\n\nSpeaker 1: to have the delight of Boris Johnson going. I I I it's makes me so happy. And and the other way, you see, is if I'm in the really unlucky position, he the next election, then I get something from you. So the whole thing is it's kind of win win, isn't it? I do you think he do you think he's gonna be able to make it To the end of the month?\n\nEnd of the week?\n\nSpeaker 0: I I I think it's very, very hard to work out. It's very, very hard to work out. I've just been looking through the odds. For some reason, Penny Morton seems to be the favorite, but I don't know I don't buy that. Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Ben and Melissa.\n\nI don't think any of that's right. I think if they had any sense at all I know Sunak and Javed have put themselves into an interesting position, but I really do think they'd be wise to to go to the backbenchers. I think there are some very strong people on their backbenchers, and they'd be wise to go there. Because this cabinet is now completely tainted. Totally tainted.\n\nSpeaker 1: Definite definitely. If you were if you were Tom Tooganhurst or Jeremy Hunt running, that would be your run, wouldn't You would say, I didn't touch this guy's cabinet. I had nothing to do with it, and I warned you guys. The the problem is, of course, that, tonally, That's pretty difficult because if everybody else is implicated, they don't want you coming they're not gonna vote for somebody who comes across. Remember, Just remind listeners that the 1st round of the voting is just the MPs.\n\nThe other conservative MPs have to put you on the final 2. Mhmm. And If they've all been compromised and they're all feeling a bit shitty about it, they're not gonna want somebody who comes across as holier than thou. So If Tom Tucano and Jeremy Hunt are running, they have to be pretty careful not to give the impression that they think everybody who serves in Boris Johnson's government\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a it's a moral minion.\n\nSpeaker 0: But also the the the the other thing that I think is, you know, worth pointing out in this is that the The politics of the parliamentary conservative party are still very dominated by the right wing, the ERG, the kind of crazy right wing stuff, which I think that Sunak is trying to appeal to in his letter. So I think that will be harder for something like Touken Hout or Jeremy Hunt. You've got to win over those Maddy or ERG guys.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the the odds are also really interesting. So the the, has got Penny Mordent at 11 to 2. Liz Truss at 36 to 5. These are sort of stupid ways of doing it. Jeremy Hunt, 38 to 5.\n\nRishi Sunak, 8 to 1. Ben Wallace, 8 to 1. Nadim Zahavi, 10 to 1. Tom Tuchenhardt, 10 to 1. And Sarit Javid, 20 to 1.\n\nNow what's interesting about that is that all those odds are quite long. When I was running to be, the leader against Boris Johnson, as we were getting at the end, I was 5 to 1, and Boris was flipped the other way around. So you'd bet, 5 pounds £5 to get £2, I think, is where he was. So it shows it shows that the race is very different from that 2019 race.\n\nSpeaker 0: Those odds though, Rory, I'm surprised you read those odds and and and name checked whilst checking. Because what the bookies do in these situations is they try to get media attention. And then people will bet on. So pretty penny that either means that somebody has suddenly put on a very, very, very large bet on Penny Morton. That is possible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which could be her mom?\n\nSpeaker 0: It could be her. It could be her best friend. It could be one of her Russian donors. You know? I don't know.\n\nShe has Russian donors, but most conservatives do. So I think that, But, you know, look, my son, as you know, works in gambling. The there's the there's a lot of odds movement goes on and the shift to give money. So, yeah, I think it's interesting. I do think Penny Morton's quite interesting.\n\nShe's always stood out from Johnson. She's not sort of and I think it would be smart for them to go for a moment. I think if they pick if they pick Les Truss As their leader, I think Keir Starmer can pretty much go to the beach. Now there are some people who think that Keir Starmer goes to the beach too much, but and in a metaphorical sort of way. But I do think this trust will be absolutely, totally destroyable in by Labour in a way that Johnson ultimately is being destroyed by reality and by himself and by the conservatives.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you think Rishi Sunak Could win. I mean, you I know you came across you thought he came across as quite thin skinned was one of your phrases, wasn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think he's I think he he's obviously been damaged very, very badly by this whole episode. I think the wealth\n\nSpeaker 1: Just just remind listeners on that episode because\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, basically, stuff started to come out that he's you know, that there was a lack of clarity about his particularly his wife's tax affairs and also the fact that he was administering her majesty's government whilst having a green card, which is essentially 1 step away from American citizenship. And I think that was probably briefed against him. I mean, he's come through that reasonably well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and and and I you know, I tried to defend them at the time. I'd like to defend them even more. Do you know, actually, a remarkable number of MPs have, dual citizenship? Actually, the peep there were there are MPs, who are American citizens. There are many MPs who are Pakistani citizens.\n\nThere are many, many MPs with Irish passports. So I was a bit surprised I was a bit surprised that the the green card was held against him so hard.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think well, I think I think, to be honest, I think it's the it's the it's the it's the sheer wealth that maybe is held against him, but I don't think that's on its own is enough to bring him down. The the point I made about thin skin was something that I kept hearing from people at the treasury. They said he's just not very good at the sort of, you You know, a bit like Rory Stewart, he sometimes needs to toughen up a bit. But he's clearly toughened up sufficient to sort of, you know, pull the carpet from under Johnson tonight.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which\n\nSpeaker 0: is a tough thing to do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really, really big move. And and I\n\nSpeaker 0: think Rory, just got you're just getting back to what you were saying earlier about the domino effect or not. I remember, do you remember when James Purnell Resign from Gordon Brown's cabinet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. I do.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and Gordon immediately, ran a pretty effective, pretty military operation. Peter Mandelson was involved as well to get everybody to come out straight away and say we're not following. And and and and it it sort of didn't go anywhere. It did undermine authority, But Gordon did still sort of survive to the next election. But I think there's something different about a chancellor and a former chancellor acting in unison like this.\n\nYou and and who is he? Who do you think he will make as chancellor? Who will he put there?\n\nSpeaker 1: So, he could put in I I'd put a always look at his, his Chief Sexley Treasury says Simon Clark might get promoted. I think,\n\nSpeaker 0: Or Barkley?\n\nSpeaker 1: He could look, Yeah. He could look at Barclay. He could look at Liz Truss. She's always wanted to be chancellor. The person who really wants the job and hasn't resigned yet, but he'll never make chancellor, It's Michael Gove because I think he just doesn't trust Michael Gove.\n\nSpeaker 0: What about Zahawi? What about Zahawi?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, Nadim Nadim is I think he's a he's somebody I like. I mean, he's very I I, you know, I'm always been impressed with him. I I traveled with him a bit during the breakout. When ISIS took Mosul, David Cameron, sent Nadim and myself off to talk to people in Iraq, and He was a really great traveling. He's funny.\n\nHe's modest. I've heard good things about him actually from his civil servants in education.\n\nSpeaker 0: I wish you I wish you'd get a decent education policy, though. I don't know what the government's education policy is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, I mean, we know what your education policy would be, wouldn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. And if that's why I'm Becky Javed, state schoolboy. Well, your list trust is a state schoolperson as well, so is Oliver Dowden.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah. And and and and and, you know, nodding Doris very much so. I mean, I think it's yeah. It's, listen. Here's another interesting one I got.\n\nSimon Hawr, who's, a you know, he's he's he's on the left of the left the party, but but rather a good tweet came out from him. He's he sometimes pulls his punches a bit. But Katie Ball said prime minister touring the tea room, talking of an interview morning. Number 10 trying to calm the ship after mood has continued to worsen. And Simon Haw tweeted out, been there, done that, Purchase the T shirt.\n\nI'm sorry. I will listen. I will learn, then joke behind closed doors. I don't see any problem, etcetera. It won't wash anymore.\n\nThat tactical ship has sailed and sunk.\n\nSpeaker 0: Good old Simon. Is he still the chairman of the Northern Ireland slate?\n\nSpeaker 1: He is. Yes. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I bet I suspect he spends all his time talking to politicians in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, and he knows the damage this guy is doing in Northern Ireland, and he's probably had enough of it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Julia Knight, good one. When you have an individual of the caliber of my friends, Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak saying enough is enough, then I'm afraid the die is cast. It's Time for the party to take a new direction. So some of this will be organized, remember. I mean, I I can't emphasize enough how having touched the edge of these leadership campaigns, These guys, by which I means, Rishi Sunak Sajid Javid, would have had their donors lined up for months.\n\nThey would have been quietly building their teams for months.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think Javid's going to run possibly as a running mate with Sunak?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think he I think big temptation to run as a running mate, But also a temptation to see if he won't go for it themselves. And often, they won't decide till the last moment. But on this, a lot of the MPs tweeting out for them Would have been prepped in advance. So it's it's quite possible, for example, that some of these guys were set up to go out to us in advance. The other thing is, I don't know if you noticed, Boris was about to make a press statement at 6, and these things broke.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. He said it. He did it. His his his press statement was to say that he made a mistake in Appointing, pincher. Uh-huh.\n\nBut I think that that, I and I think that's what triggered the a big thing went around. He's making a statement. I guess Soon Haak and Javi will probably say, well, is he gonna resign? They don't. He's gonna say it was a mistake.\n\nWell, we do that anyway. Bang out the letters. No. That was that was that was part of the kind of and this is the other thing about Downing Street. I mean, they're so incompetent.\n\nThey can't do they can't do anything. What did they ever do that worked?\n\nSpeaker 1: 6 one one of one of the problems, it says he continuing to sort of kick these people, is remember In an earlier thing, we talked about the appointment of Steve Barclay, and I said, it's ridiculous. The chief of staff in Downing Street is a full time job. Yeah. And Steve Barclay is doing it while being a constituency MP and actually a constituency that's quite Cambridge are quite a long way from London. And, also, he's doing it while being a minister.\n\nIt just doesn't work. I mean, that is a 20 four seven job.\n\nSpeaker 0: How many scandals ago was it that John Johnson's response was that he's going to put in a new team to professionalize the operation? They he can't do it. He's morally incapable. He's practically incapable. Well,\n\nSpeaker 1: that that that'll be the problem for Steve Buckley, to be fair. I mean, Steve is a competent guy. He he was was in the private sector, runs things well, was briefly in the army. He's a competent guy, but you cannot manage Boris Johnson. Even if Steve Buckley was doing it full time, which he's not, You can't manage him because as as I mean, as Simon Macdonald found in in the front office, we would I think it's one of the things that triggered this actually is Simon Macdonald, who both you and I know well, Sending in a very, very extraordinary clear letter pointing out the lies that were told about Chris Pincher.\n\nBut but Watching all these people try to manage Boris Johnson. I mean, the only person who kind of did it was a man called sir Simon Milton who was his chief of staff in London. And it may be something to do with the London mayoral job, which Boris Johnson played as a kind of ceremonial mascot. You know? Largely, it was about being frozen on a zipline waving a couple of miniature flags and getting stuck.\n\nAnd he let Eddie Lister and and Simon Milton get on with doing the property deals and all that kind of stuff. But running the country just doesn't work like that.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. And also the other thing that I you know, when you talk to people who were in the assembly at the time that, Johnson was mayor, They didn't they did spot that he had this inability to to check out facts, duty, detail, and tell the truth. And, again, It's a different level to be prime minister, to being London mayor or even chancellor of the exchequer. You're exposed in a different way. And even with the slavish backing of Lord Daker and Lord Murdoch and Lord all the others that all the sort of, you know, media barons that still you know, it'd be interesting what they do tomorrow.\n\nI think they've been sort of blowing with the wind as well. But I think that, you know, this is the thing that people have to take out of this. You should not put into really serious positions in government people who are fundamentally not Sirius. He is not a serious person.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and I think it's really shameful that it happened at all. I mean, I think this is where I guess I'm still a little unforgiving towards people like Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden, who who really hard and in a really important way when he's running for leadership. And I remember those conversations saying to colleagues in fact, actually, towards the end, I was saying, why don't you Vote for Sarajid Javid. Why don't you vote for Jeremy Hunt? And people saying, well, Boris is gonna win.\n\nAnd I'd say, but he's completely Incapable of doing this. I mean, I remember saying this to Grant Shapps, who was one of his big backers. I said, look. I've worked with him in the foreign office. I've seen Absolutely up close and personal month after month that he cannot be trusted to do the simplest thing, that he will Completely screw up our policy with Kenya in a single phone call.\n\nHe will take no interest at all. He'll he'll launch Libya policy without noticing, we don't have an embassy active in Libya. We can't have him as prime minister. But the answer was always, yeah, but he can win. And\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, he can't win now. He can't win now. He can't win. Now, Rory, we're going to have to, I don't know if our listeners know, but Gary Lineker's day job, he he basically edits. You know, he decides what the graphics are and, you know, he just loves his podcast so much.\n\nAnd he's now going to have to spend all night cutting out those bits of the podcast we've already recorded that are now being superseded by what we've said just now. But there's 1 and and then then on Later in the week, we will do the question and answer session as well. But I want to trail that with one of the questions which I just spotted from the princess of Yorkshire. And she obviously was, was was ahead of Sunak and Javid. She said, do you think that we will need a truth and reconciliation process once Johnson is gone?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Pretty good question, isn't it? Very good question. We're we're pretty close to that, aren't we? And and as you say, the damage is semipermanent. I mean, it's so so sad, So sad to see someone so incapable of government.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, for me for me, the biggest symbol of that remains Brexit. I mean, the fact is that Brexit would not have happened without Boris Johnson. Brexit would not have happened without Dominic Cummings. The people who delivered Brexit, are proven liars, proven cheats. In Johnson's case, he talks about having a 3rd term in office.\n\nFrankly, I will not rest until he's serving his 1st term in prison for misconduct in public office. As you know, Rory, I don't believe we should be filling the presence with, with with with with petty crimes. But he is not a petty criminal. He's a major crook.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I would like to reach out to those listeners who voted for Brexit, If there are any left after your after your your cards and say, look. This this is The the tragedy of this is this goes so much deeper than that single issue. I mean, he has just corroded\n\nSpeaker 0: our constitution. Rule of law, judiciary, media.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's so sad. I mean, he's everything that will follow on from this. And maybe we'll learn an important lesson. Maybe we'll end up with proportional representation. We'll end up with the constitution.\n\nYeah. We'll sort these things out. Maybe we'll separate our executive from our legislature. Maybe the parties will collapse. But Goodness gracious me.\n\nIt feels like the end of the Roman Empire. I mean, he feels like one of those very strange I mean, that's one of the odd things about him. He's a guy who It's completely also oddly. He's he was obviously a clever young child. Right?\n\nHe was able Doing exams when he was 12, 13. But somewhere along this time and I don't know when he was, maybe 14 or 15 or something. He just stopped thinking. You can't actually have a serious conversation with him about anything. He gets bored within about 10 seconds.\n\nI know.\n\nSpeaker 0: Funny enough, I was with somebody today on this pro this TV program I told you about, make me prime minister. And they said, I don't think he's very clever, you know. I think he's he's had a very expensive education, but I don't think he's very clever. I thought it was quite an insightful comment. Thank you for joining us for our Rest is Politics special.\n\nThere will be a regular episode on Thursday in which we discuss labor and Brexit, China, Taiwan, the economy, and the new Elvis Presley film. But tonight, Britain's tumultuous politics has offered yet another dramatic development. Boris Johnson is on the brink, and hopefully, before too long, We'll be saying goodbye to him just as we're saying goodbye now to you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodbye from me too.",
