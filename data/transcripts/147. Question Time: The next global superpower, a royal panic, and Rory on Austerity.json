Welcome to The Rest is Politics Question Time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. We've got we've got to ask this one first, I think. Soccer mama. That's good name. My question is why should I bother asking as you'll never read it, let alone answer it. That is all. So there you go, Soccermama. We've read it. But I have noticed that if you put at the beginning of the question, I've asked says 7 times Alastair is more likely to to ask your question. I might also sometimes suggest if your question also involves, do you think The Tories and the most hopeless government that have ever been seen in world history. You're probably quite likely to get your question asked. I think we'll do it a little bit more subtly than that. Just a little bit more subtly. So on the on the Percivalians points, Jane Wilkinson Yeah. I realized I need to ask at least 10 times to win a Percivalians award. So for the 4th time and counting, Please respond properly to the year 12 question which you chose to read out about medical school places. Mark Richardson, will you please answer the question you had weeks ago from a 17 year old asking why finding training places to be a doctor is so difficult. You promised to research it, so please can we have an answer to an excellent question. So I have done a bit of research, and let's start off by saying something that that that is unspeakable In the current populist post truth politics that we have, it's very complicated. Oh, good. Oh, well, I'm glad. We don't often say that. Got it. Well, it is it is complicated. So I'm gonna try and go through some of the complications. The first thing is, it's the it's the general medical council rather than the government which determines which Institutions are allowed to offer medical degrees. They are looking to extend it so that they can grow the number of places. Yep. The next thing is that there there does seem culturally to have been a bit of a sort of BMA leverage point about protecting The, quote, special profession. But because I think it's now agreed that there is a workforce crisis, that is no longer holding. The big point as well that's being made is about quality of teaching. How do you advance the numbers without also advancing the number of medical called teachers, and where are you going to take them from when you want those people to be working. And, of course, students have to learn from qualified doctors. They have to go in large groups into clinics, into theaters, into a and e, into GP surgeries. But the planning of those clinical placements is something that is not easy when the NHS is under as much stress as it is now. In an attempt to get on top of this, I did have a brief look at A very, very good briefing from the House of Commons Library Mhmm. Which I recommend for anybody who's interested in nerdy questions on British politics. So it points out that each year around 9,500 medical school places are made available across the UK to train new doctors. And since 2013, This figure has increased by around 2,000. So it was 7,500. It's now 9,500. And they're currently kept in England, and the government claims, for all the reasons you've pointed out, part of it's about Making sure the standards are kept high in high quality placements. There is an issue around money. So it costs about £230,000 for each medical or dental school place. So another 5,000 students would cost approximately £1,000,000,000. But the Biggest question, I think, isn't just money. It's about getting the high quality capacity to train the doctors. And in the meantime, of course, the problem is we're bringing a lot of doctors from overseas because we're not training our end, Which is not kind to other countries, and it means we're stripping countries like Zimbabwe of some of their most qualified medical professionals and bring them to the United Kingdom. You know what I've told you before about the in the Balkans, they they are you know, the Germans are absolutely they're having massive advertising campaigns get nurses in the Balkans to go to to Germany to fit the gap there. I do think as well that the the the other issue that has come through some of the questions in the many weeks that people have been asking us to Try to address this. Is the whole thing about students from poorer backgrounds, even though they might have good grades, finding it really, really hard to get into Medical schools, and some of them some of the schools are now trying to, trying to address that. But, of course, as you say, people want to be sure that the standards are Very, very high. Unbelievably competitive. 9,500 places only. I mean, it's incredibly small of the total number of university places and other subjects. Also, I didn't see it at the weekend, but it's Rishi Sunak is apparently talking about moving to some sort of system where you can we literally can begin to have what what they will be termed, you know, apprentices working within the health service. Now I don't know whether that applies to doctors and nurses, but we need to maybe check that one out as well. So listen. I don't think we can do justice to this because As we've both shown, we are very reliant on on reading from other people's analysis as opposed to any direct experience. But our shorthand answer is that it's more complicated maybe than we thought when we first addressed it. Very good. Okay. Now, Alastair, since last week, you have appeared on The 2nd question time in the country, not the rest is politics question time, but the the kind of BBC budget version of question time. And you appeared in Clacton, and it was A very unique event in which the audience were all people who had voted for Brexit, Clackton, very famous strong Brexit voting town. Tell us who you had on the panel. Give us a sense of the panel. Well, scandalously, in my view, nobody the government put nobody up. They told Question Time they were going to, and then Literally on the day, I think, they said, no, we've decided we're not putting anybody up, whether that was because they didn't want to celebrate Independence Day 7 years on, whether it's because they didn't want to have me raging at them or whether it's because they didn't actually want to face the people that vote for Brexit to be told that they've been let down, which a lot of them felt. I don't know. So there's John Redwood, Ben Habib, former Brexit party MP, Jenny Chapman for Labour, And Anand Menon, who we talked about when you gave me your very, very sensible advice, Murray, last week, which I have to tell you was echoed. And this actually, may I say, had even more of an impact on me. I'm going to give a shout out for Clacton Coastal Academy, which I mentioned on the program because I went there. When When it was announced I was going, this school got in touch with me. They know that, you know, I've been going to lots of schools in, since particularly since the book came out. And I went into this school, Clutch and Coaster Academy, very tough area, included Jarek, which is one of the poorest parts of the country, the whole country. And the kids were absolutely they really were good. I mean, they were very shy at first and quite timid in expressing an opinion, but by the end, honestly, they were absolutely brilliant. And, anyway, I said at the end, I said, right. I'm going off from here to question time. Brexit only, audience. As you know, I'm not a big fan of Brexit. What's the best way to kind of, you know, to deal with them? And this young woman called Annabelle, she said, don't trim your views. Say what you think, But say in a respectful way, try to persuade rather than criticize, and try to understand why they did vote the way they did. And that is why that was the present. So I actually, when John Redwood started talking absolute nonsense, I just had Anna below my head saying, just let him spout it. Just ignore him. Talk to the audience. Now here's here's a question from Jude. I really like this question from Jude. I voted remain, But feel sorry for the audience members in Thursday's question time who have been pilloried on social media for their opinions. Should they, and I don't know if this is possible, have been edited out, corrected? Anyway, it's played to a stereotype. What do Alastair and Rory think? So she's she's worried about this, and she and it's true, isn't it? Some of the questions were kinda mocked on social media. There there was one which I saw played a lot. There was a lady who said I think she was trying to say the problem was that Whenever rules were passed by Brussels, the British obeyed them and other people didn't, but she ended up saying, it's all about the roofs. When we go on roofs in Britain, we had to follow the rules. Whenever she goes to France Germany with all these people on the roofs who weren't following the rules. Very similar question. Jamie Crawford, is it a fair game to have a go at the knot on my roof or from the beaches to the benefits of its audience members, or should our ire be directed at the cabal that fed them this nonsense? Then he says, I felt Alastair was calm and collected. 1 people over. That has to be the approach. I mean, look, the just to to give the context, So the first, there was this quite elderly lady who talked about the rules and the and it became a thing about the roofs. And then there was a guy who said he'd literally seen people come off, You know, come and arrive in the country and go straight down the benefits office. And James O'Brien, for example, did a, you know, a pretty splenetic takedown of that one. Again, I I had, Annabelle in my head again. I I basically said, right, I could say, well, actually, no. I think that's unfair because, but I didn't. And I do think it was unfair. And I also do agree with Jude that I think we do have to criticize the people who Pedal the law of this nonsense. The truth is that we've had 3, 4 decades of anti European propaganda in a lot of our papers. We we did have liars like, I've got to tell you, Roy. I got a round of applause for saying that, you know, the whole thing was run by a bunch of liars, Johnson, etcetera. So but I I I went into it with the aim of trying to understand why people voted, but also to get a proper sense as to whether many any of them or many of them were changing their minds. And there was there was another question which I thought was really perceptive. Rebecca Gould, this week's Question Time seemed much quieter and sadder than I thought it was going to be. Was it everyone trying very hard to disagree agree agreeably? What did it feel like in the studio? What it felt like was that a lot of people there was no anger. Apart from 1 or 2 people, there was very little anger directed at me. There was a lot of anger directed at Brexit and the way it was happening. And my favorite question of the lot, Josh says this, I'm I'm a huge fan. Enjoy your commentary. Just wanted to know what was your funniest moment from Question Time. For me, it was a member of the audience saying Brexit could be good if it had gone to a different school. What it was what the woman was saying was to Ben Khabib. She said, I'm sick and tired of you people telling me if only we did Brexit the way I want to do Brexit, It would have worked. And what did so one of the central characters in this is this figure called John Redwood, who was a cabinet minister under, Margaret Thatcher was a sort of academic. He's a fellow of all souls, meant to be kind of very was obviously a very, very brilliantly clever student because he managed to get into all souls And has been the kind of Vulcan ideologue of the Brexit move. What what did you make of him? I mean, he's kind of famously sort of Clever, but slightly uncanny in his manner. What do you make of his communication style? What do you make of who he is and how he ended up where he is? Well, we had a we had a question as well about what the mood was like in the green room before and afterwards. And, look, at a personal level, I've always gone with, I I find that John Rode was somebody that's perfectly straightforward to talk to and doesn't really doesn't mind you challenging his views, and will come back and give as good as he gets. I thought Peter Kyle, by the way, who I know you think is, terrific and so do I. Well, look at Peter's Takedown. We should put it I tweeted it yesterday. We should put it in the in the, newsletter. Peter Kyle did an absolutely brutal demolition of John Redwood by he'd gone back to look at John Redwood's website back in the days before the referendum, saying what was going to happen, and he Absolutely took him down. I wish I'd had all the same stuff. No. I think John Redwood was just one of those guys who he he's always believed the same thing. He always believes that John Redwood is right about the economy. He always believes that and he says what he says with absolute conviction. And if you challenge him, as I challenged him, for example, When I said you know, he said he'd never you know, the trade deal is not that big a deal. We don't need to worry about America, blah blah. I said, well, hold on a minute. Why did you say that we were one of the big wins was gonna be getting this trade deal. He just said, well, I never said that, the populous thing. And lots of people posted lots of occasions where he had said it. But I don't I don't sort of loathe him in a way that I loathe the liars because I think that I said on the program, I think people like him have always believed in what he tried to achieve with his very Eurosceptic views. I mean, with the interview with John Major, for example, John Redwood challenged John Major because he felt John Major was going the wrong direction on on Europe. So I think he's a perfectly honorable kinda guy. I just think he's very, very wrong about a lot of stuff. Okay. Over to you. Questions. Right. Lord of the sheep. Lord of the sheep? Rory seems a decent person, says lord of the sheep. How does he reconcile his ethics With the harm done to the public as a result of austerity, I have seen it firsthand the harm that's been suffered. It cannot be denied. I believe the current mess in our country is largely due to austerity. So I think there was another question about this, Roy, that was about, could you explain lots of people often post on social media, quotes, your voting record. And I I'm giving you an opportunity again to explain why if you're in a government, you have to choose. Look. It's a very good challenge, but this Question around voting record is a question about what political party you belong to. Unfortunately, for better or for worse, in the British political system, You vote with your party. Even rebels, you know, even people who are seen as famous rebels are voting with their parties 95% of the time. But it's even more extreme if you're a government minister because it's a constitutional rule that you have to always vote for the government if you're a government minister because it's called Collective responsibility, ministerial responsibility. And if you don't vote with the government, you resign. And if you don't vote with the government on something important, you're kicked out. On how many occasions did you vote for something as a government minister that had you back had been a backbencher, you'd have felt very, very queasy about? I I never voted for anything that I felt deeply queasy for. I often voted for things that I thought, oh, I'm not quite sure about that. But Yeah. When push came to shove on things I felt very queasy about, I voted against the government, but the result of that was the first time I did it, I was not promoted for the next 4 years. And the 2nd time I did it, I was kicked out of the conservative party. So I vote 2 against no deal Brexit. But Yeah. People need to understand that The deal is that it's better or worse a team sport, and the justification for that is that the public vote for a manifesto. They vote for a party, and they expect the party to deliver that manifesto. They don't expect the local MP they voted for to start rebelling against what they think they've signed up for. And we can debate that whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, but that's the way the systems work. So these these these things where they say, look at the voting record, is completely absurd. All you say when you say, yeah. This guy looks like a nice guy, but look at his voting record is what you're saying is This guy looks like an ice guy, but he was a member of a Tory government. That's all you're saying. Yeah. But if but when you were not in the government When people sort of raise things on your voting record, is there anything on your voting record when you were a backbencher that you sometimes think, oh, we shouldn't have done that? Yeah, I think that the way that austerity was done was very, very, it was it was often incredibly damaging, so I saw that very directly in prisons. Yep. Hacked the, A number of prison officers hacked the budgets of prisons, increased the number of prisoners and ended up with drug filled, violent, filthy, unsafe Presence. So that's a very good example of austerity gone completely wrong. Why did I support the principle? I mean, I you know, that's that goes into the question of how much debt I think the country can handle how much deficit I think the country handle, and I disagree with people who believe that there is an easy way to just Borrow money and spend money and generate growth by doing that, but I guess that's because I was a conservative, not on the other side of the house. Now, Rory, while I'm being the interrogator here, I've got one here from Amy Mention. And would Rory kindly regale us with the story about the time he found himself trapped inside the king's panic room at Highgrove? Then I'll tell you my high growth story. Very good. Okay. So I was, I think, 19 years old, and I had been employed as the tutor To princes William and Harry. For how long? Well, it's for the summer holidays. For the summer holidays. So I had just arrived, and I went off to have a bath about 11 o'clock at night. And weirdly, there were 2 doors on the bathroom. Anyway, I locked the the door that I thought was the right door to lock, got into my bath, got out of the bath, tried to unlock the door, and I couldn't unlock it. And I thought, for goodness' sake, and I kept struggling with the key, and I couldn't shift it. Eventually, there was a knock on the door, and this familiar voice, it's the voice king, but I'm not gonna commit Lacey Mascher's day by trying to imitate the voice of the king. But, anyway, the voice of the king then said, Rory, would you mind turning out the lights out when you go to bed? He obviously cares about the environment, wants to turn lights So I say, I'm really sorry, sir. I'm now very, very scared 19 year old. It's my 1st proper job. I'm really sorry, sir. I seem to have locked myself in the loo. And he says, don't be so ridiculous, Rory. Turn the key in the lock. So I'm so terrified. I turn the key in the lock so hard that I I snap it off at the haft, And I'm left with this thing. And I then look around, and I said, I'm really, really sorry, sir. I've snapped the key off in the half. And he says, you're not seriously suggesting it's midnight that I have to wake up the whole house and get them to axe down the door? And I say, no. No. No. So it's absolutely fine. I'll I'll sleep the night on the bathroom floor. There's there is just so there is a sort of harump from the other kind of the door. And did you sleep there? The Prince of Wales disappears. So I then look around this thing and realize what's happened is that this is the anti terrorist panic room of the building. And there's a big sign up saying ring Scotland Yard and, you know, jump out of the window. And this thing that I've I've locked is this kind of bomb proof metal door to prevent a terrorist getting in. So about 20 minutes later, there is the sound literally of axes on the door. And eventually, the door is broken through and there is the Prince of Wales in this dressing gown directing a group of people with axes driving out, and for the rest of my time at Highgrove, literally, I would sit there at at the breakfast table, the lunch table, And all the people serving me could not stop themselves sniggering every time they try to pour the soup. Listen, Rory. That is just such a great story. I think we should have a separate podcast. The the rest is Rory's time at Highgrove. Right. But, listen, I've got a desk quite impressive, though, that he's going around turning the lights off. Is that part of his eco warriordom, that he goes around making sure there's no lights on. Well, I I think I think he does care about the environment. Yeah. Are you gonna tell us your high growth story, or are we gonna move on to that? Story is that at one point when Tony and Sheree were going for lunch with the then Prince of Wales at Highgrove, and we were meant to be going on to Coventry. So I was with them in the car behind. And I just texted ahead to one of the protection people and said, look. Can you check out if there's a swimming pool? So because while a lot of us swim while Tony's having lunch. And I later discovered this caused absolute sort of protocol consternation because, of course, there is a swimming pool, but only he is meant to swim in it. And I don't think he's I don't think he swims very much. So after a sort of bit of, you know, Republican badgering, eventually, they sort of, you know, rather grumpily agreed that I could go in the swimming pool. But I've got to tell you, I don't know if you ever went in the swimming pool, the highgrove, but it didn't feel like it was Swumming very much. There were a lot of green things there. You swum in a lot of unique places. I mean, someday, we need a book out of you on places you swum. Right then. We'll be back in a second, so let's just take a quick break. Now here's a more serious one. Right? We I think we'll both be interested in this. James Moores, what would you say are the key criteria For a country to be considered a superpower, which countries do you believe have the potential to meet that criteria in coming decades? Related to that, Tim Johnson, Why does the UK still deserve a permanent seat on the UN Security Council? If the UN was founded now, would the UK be in that same position? Well, so I think the answer is, of course, if the UN was founded now, the UK would not be likely to be in the same position. I mean, its only claim is that it's a nuclear power, but In population terms, it's very small compared to the global population. Its economy is increasingly small compared to its big competitors like the US and China. Criteria to be a superpower? Well, I guess the the obvious rising powers are China and then India. And I think to be a superpower is really about being able to hyperbolically project your power globally, not just on a regional basis, But be able to bring the full force of your economic and military might to bear almost anywhere around the world. Gon, over to you. Well, I yeah. I think that's right. And I think it means that, actually, although we talked during the Cold War about America and Russia or the Soviet Union being superpowers. The Soviet Union was only really a superpower because of the strength of its The size of its military arsenal, in particular, its nuclear arsenal. America, a genuine superpower. I'd say at the moment China and America are both are the only 2 superpowers. And I think there are others that could emerge in that way. I think it's economic, military, cultural. And it's also it's also really about how they relate relate to the rest of the world. I mean, there's not a single other leader in the world who doesn't, You know, if the phone goes and it's it's the Chinese embassy saying president Xi would like to have this conversation or it's the u the White House president Biden would like to have a conversation, They're kind of the top level. And I do think that the UK I I said this on question time. I really do feel that Brexit has reduced us further, that we're no longer, You know, we're no longer top tier other than, you know, for the historic reasons in the UN. But I think there's a danger that we're we're we're going down, you know, not just from 2nd tier, but lower than that. I think what about the African countries? Do you think any of the African countries could ever emerge Well, 1 in 10 children born in the world will be born in Nigeria by 2050. That actually is a segue into a question from Fred Gray. Friend of mine in the US sent me an email which mentioned a community work program in Rwanda called Umuganda, in Kenya, Rwanda, which means uniting to achieve a common purpose. So this is an amazing event. He's asked whether, either of us have seen it, and I have definitely seen it, and it is for real. So on the last Saturday of every month, if you are a citizen without disabilities aged between 18 and 65, You basically have to get out there from 8 in the morning for 3 hours picking up the rubbish and and doing some other stuff too. That's you have community meetings. And, essentially, you you'd get arrested if you're not not picking up the rubbish, and it's incredible. I mean, on a Saturday morning, the traffic is at a complete standstill, And the streets are full of people tidying up the capital city or out in the rural areas having community meetings. And as a result, Rwanda is pretty clean. It's like the Switzerland of Africa. I I nearly I nearly got into a, an altercation yesterday when Grace and I were out walking the dog, and she stopped me from confronting these people who were literally just throwing litter. Oh. This is on Hampstead Heath. They were having a sort of picnic type thing. During and you you didn't get an altercation? I didn't because Grace said, no. Please, dad don't, please. We're fed up. We're getting you out of fights. But it was it was just it just disgusted It stitched me so much. It was literally she was, like, wiping things and throwing the tissues into the grass, and then her husband or a partner or boyfriend, whatever, necking this bottle of beer, and just chucking it over his shoulder. It does my head in. Now we said on the main podcast we were going to cover this. Dorothy Darling, Disappointing to see Keir Starmer, West Streeting, etcetera, at Murdoch party. Why toady up to him instead of rejecting his poison? Are they too worried about lack of or negative coverage? I think people will be thrilled to see politicians giving him the cut, prove that they're not just more of the same. So, I mean, I was quite proud not to go to his parties, And and I I thought it was actually a bit embarrassing to do so, but colleagues went, Labour politicians, Conservative politicians because they believe that if they didn't go, I guess they would get negative coverage in the newspapers, didn't they? Yeah. I think it is about this sort of you know, it's like they I think it's the Murdoch Empire in particular sort of feel that they are almost like a a kind of state, and you have to Treat them like that, and they have diplomats. They have ambassadors around the place. And I do think, I I was pleased that Ed Miliband, when he was leader leader of the Labour Party, really went for them over, you know, over their role in phone hacking and the criminal abuse in the media and so forth. I get why IKEA does it, but I I think there will be quite a lot of people like, Dorothy there who, And why why does he do it? Sorry. Just to For the for the reason for the reasons you said in the main podcast that it's about trying to neutralize something that could be quite a nasty enemy. No. I think there'll be a nasty enemy anyway. I don't think that kid and labor are gonna get a fair deal. And do you really think that if you don't I mean, I didn't turn up, didn't respond to the invitation. Do you think he actually is vindictive against people who don't come to his party? I don't think it'll be about necessarily vindictive about people who don't who don't go to his his jamborees, but I think vindictive to people who he feels do not Show him what he considers to be respect or who, you know, veer too far away from political views that he deems to be palatable. I I think he's just vindictive, but I think he puts the word out to his papers. You know? Do what you can do this guy in. Final question, Rory. This one this one made me laugh. Paul Cuddeford. How does Rory feel when having made a good point, Alastair usually says right in a way that illustrates that he hasn't listened to the point as he's so consumed by what he's about to say. It's not a criticism. I find it quite funny. It happens a lot, and I love your work. Let me just tell you, Paul, I say right In that way, when Rory has made a point that I actually think is worth just allowing to stand on its own, unlike Rory, who regularly, after I make a point, says good or very good and then moves on. Is that not true, Rory? Yeah. Yep. Right. Right. Right. Very good. Thank you. Let's go. Bye bye. Alright. Goodbye.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to The Rest is Politics Question Time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell. We've got we've got to ask this one first, I think. Soccer mama.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good name.\n\nSpeaker 0: My question is why should I bother asking as you'll never read it, let alone answer it. That is all. So there you go, Soccermama. We've read it.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I have noticed that if you put at the beginning of the question, I've asked says 7 times Alastair is more likely to to ask your question. I might also sometimes suggest if your question also involves, do you think The Tories and the most hopeless government that have ever been seen in world history. You're probably quite likely to get your question asked.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think we'll do it a little bit more subtly than that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just a little bit\n\nSpeaker 0: more subtly. So on the on the Percivalians points, Jane Wilkinson Yeah. I realized I need to ask at least 10 times to win a Percivalians award. So for the 4th time and counting, Please respond properly to the year 12 question which you chose to read out about medical school places. Mark Richardson, will you please answer the question you had weeks ago from a 17 year old asking why finding training places to be a doctor is so difficult.\n\nYou promised to research it, so please can we have an answer to an excellent question. So I have done a bit of research, and let's start off by saying something that that that is unspeakable In the current populist post truth politics that we have, it's very complicated.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, good. Oh, well, I'm glad. We don't often say that. Got it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it is it is complicated. So I'm gonna try and go through some of the complications. The first thing is, it's the it's the general medical council rather than the government which determines which Institutions are allowed to offer medical degrees. They are looking to extend it so that they can grow the number of places. Yep.\n\nThe next thing is that there there does seem culturally to have been a bit of a sort of BMA leverage point about protecting The, quote, special profession. But because I think it's now agreed that there is a workforce crisis, that is no longer holding. The big point as well that's being made is about quality of teaching. How do you advance the numbers without also advancing the number of medical called teachers, and where are you going to take them from when you want those people to be working. And, of course, students have to learn from qualified doctors.\n\nThey have to go in large groups into clinics, into theaters, into a and e, into GP surgeries. But the planning of those clinical placements is something that is not easy when the NHS is under as much stress as it is now.\n\nSpeaker 1: In an attempt to get on top of this, I did have a brief look at A very, very good briefing from the House of Commons Library Mhmm. Which I recommend for anybody who's interested in nerdy questions on British politics. So it points out that each year around 9,500 medical school places are made available across the UK to train new doctors. And since 2013, This figure has increased by around 2,000. So it was 7,500.\n\nIt's now 9,500. And they're currently kept in England, and the government claims, for all the reasons you've pointed out, part of it's about Making sure the standards are kept high in high quality placements. There is an issue around money. So it costs about £230,000 for each medical or dental school place. So another 5,000 students would cost approximately £1,000,000,000.\n\nBut the Biggest question, I think, isn't just money. It's about getting the high quality capacity to train the doctors. And in the meantime, of course, the problem is we're bringing a lot of doctors from overseas because we're not training our end, Which is not kind to other countries, and it means we're stripping countries like Zimbabwe\n\nSpeaker 0: of\n\nSpeaker 1: some of their most qualified medical professionals and bring them to the United Kingdom.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know what I've told you before about the in the Balkans, they they are you know, the Germans are absolutely they're having massive advertising campaigns get nurses in the Balkans to go to to Germany to fit the gap there. I do think as well that the the the other issue that has come through some of the questions in the many weeks that people have been asking us to Try to address this. Is the whole thing about students from poorer backgrounds, even though they might have good grades, finding it really, really hard to get into Medical schools, and some of them some of the schools are now trying to, trying to address that. But, of course, as you say, people want to be sure that the standards are Very, very high.\n\nSpeaker 1: Unbelievably competitive. 9,500 places only. I mean, it's incredibly small of the total number of university places and other subjects.\n\nSpeaker 0: Also, I didn't see it at the weekend, but it's Rishi Sunak is apparently talking about moving to some sort of system where you can we literally can begin to have what what they will be termed, you know, apprentices working within the health service. Now I don't know whether that applies to doctors and nurses, but we need to maybe check that one out as well. So listen. I don't think we can do justice to this because As we've both shown, we are very reliant on on reading from other people's analysis as opposed to any direct experience. But our shorthand answer is that it's more complicated maybe than we thought when we first addressed it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Now, Alastair, since last week, you have appeared on The 2nd question time in the country, not the rest is politics question time, but the the kind of BBC budget version of question time. And you appeared in Clacton, and it was A very unique event in which the audience were all people who had voted for Brexit, Clackton, very famous strong Brexit voting town. Tell us who you had on the panel.\n\nGive us a sense of the panel.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, scandalously, in my view, nobody the government put nobody up. They told Question Time they were going to, and then Literally on the day, I think, they said, no, we've decided we're not putting anybody up, whether that was because they didn't want to celebrate Independence Day 7 years on, whether it's because they didn't want to have me raging at them or whether it's because they didn't actually want to face the people that vote for Brexit to be told that they've been let down, which a lot of them felt. I don't know. So there's John Redwood, Ben Habib, former Brexit party MP, Jenny Chapman for Labour, And Anand Menon, who we talked about when you gave me your very, very sensible advice, Murray, last week, which I have to tell you was echoed. And this actually, may I say, had even more of an impact on me.\n\nI'm going to give a shout out for Clacton Coastal Academy, which I mentioned on the program because I went there. When When it was announced I was going, this school got in touch with me. They know that, you know, I've been going to lots of schools in, since particularly since the book came out. And I went into this school, Clutch and Coaster Academy, very tough area, included Jarek, which is one of the poorest parts of the country, the whole country. And the kids were absolutely they really were good.\n\nI mean, they were very shy at first and quite timid in expressing an opinion, but by the end, honestly, they were absolutely brilliant. And, anyway, I said at the end, I said, right. I'm going off from here to question time. Brexit only, audience. As you know, I'm not a big fan of Brexit.\n\nWhat's the best way to kind of, you know, to deal with them? And this young woman called Annabelle, she said, don't trim your views. Say what you think, But say in a respectful way, try to persuade rather than criticize, and try to understand why they did vote the way they did. And that is why that was the present. So I actually, when John Redwood started talking absolute nonsense, I just had Anna below my head saying, just let him spout it.\n\nJust ignore him. Talk to the audience.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now here's here's a question from Jude. I really like this question from Jude. I voted remain, But feel sorry for the audience members in Thursday's question time who have been pilloried on social media for their opinions. Should they, and I don't know if this is possible, have been edited out, corrected? Anyway, it's played to a stereotype.\n\nWhat do Alastair and Rory think? So she's she's worried about this, and she and it's true, isn't it? Some of the questions were kinda mocked on social media. There there was one which I saw played a lot. There was a lady who said I think she was trying to say the problem was that Whenever rules were passed by Brussels, the British obeyed them and other people didn't, but she ended up saying, it's all about the roofs.\n\nWhen we go on roofs in Britain, we had to follow the rules. Whenever she goes to France Germany with all these people on the roofs who weren't following the rules.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very similar question. Jamie Crawford, is it a fair game to have a go at the knot on my roof or from the beaches to the benefits of its audience members, or should our ire be directed at the cabal that fed them this nonsense? Then he says, I felt Alastair was calm and collected. 1 people over. That has to be the approach.\n\nI mean, look, the just to to give the context, So the first, there was this quite elderly lady who talked about the rules and the and it became a thing about the roofs. And then there was a guy who said he'd literally seen people come off, You know, come and arrive in the country and go straight down the benefits office. And James O'Brien, for example, did a, you know, a pretty splenetic takedown of that one. Again, I I had, Annabelle in my head again. I I basically said, right, I could say, well, actually, no.\n\nI think that's unfair because, but I didn't. And I do think it was unfair. And I also do agree with Jude that I think we do have to criticize the people who Pedal the law of this nonsense. The truth is that we've had 3, 4 decades of anti European propaganda in a lot of our papers. We we did have liars like, I've got to tell you, Roy.\n\nI got a round of applause for saying that, you know, the whole thing was run by a bunch of liars, Johnson, etcetera. So but I I I went into it with the aim of trying to understand why people voted, but also to get a proper sense as to whether many any of them or many of them were changing their minds. And there was there was another question which I thought was really perceptive. Rebecca Gould, this week's Question Time seemed much quieter and sadder than I thought it was going to be. Was it everyone trying very hard to disagree agree agreeably?\n\nWhat did it feel like in the studio? What it felt like was that a lot of people there was no anger. Apart from 1 or 2 people, there was very little anger directed at me. There was a lot of anger directed at Brexit and the way it was happening. And my favorite question of the lot, Josh says this, I'm I'm a huge fan.\n\nEnjoy your commentary. Just wanted to know what was your funniest moment from Question Time. For me, it was a member of the audience saying Brexit could be good if it had gone to a different school. What it was what the woman was saying was to Ben Khabib. She said, I'm sick and tired of you people telling me if only we did Brexit the way I want to do Brexit, It would have worked.\n\nSpeaker 1: And what did so one of the central characters in this is this figure called John Redwood, who was a cabinet minister under, Margaret Thatcher was a sort of academic. He's a fellow of all souls, meant to be kind of very was obviously a very, very brilliantly clever student because he managed to get into all souls And has been the kind of Vulcan ideologue of the Brexit move. What what did you make of him? I mean, he's kind of famously sort of Clever, but slightly uncanny in his manner. What do you make of his communication style?\n\nWhat do you make of who he is and how he ended up where he is?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, we had a we had a question as well about what the mood was like in the green room before and afterwards. And, look, at a personal level, I've always gone with, I I find that John Rode was somebody that's perfectly straightforward to talk to and doesn't really doesn't mind you challenging his views, and will come back and give as good as he gets. I thought Peter Kyle, by the way, who I know you think is, terrific and so do I. Well, look at Peter's Takedown. We should put it I tweeted it yesterday.\n\nWe should put it in the in the, newsletter. Peter Kyle did an absolutely brutal demolition of John Redwood by he'd gone back to look at John Redwood's website back in the days before the referendum, saying what was going to happen, and he Absolutely took him down. I wish I'd had all the same stuff. No. I think John Redwood was just one of those guys who he he's always believed the same thing.\n\nHe always believes that John Redwood is right about the economy. He always believes that and he says what he says with absolute conviction. And if you challenge him, as I challenged him, for example, When I said you know, he said he'd never you know, the trade deal is not that big a deal. We don't need to worry about America, blah blah. I said, well, hold on a minute.\n\nWhy did you say that we were one of the big wins was gonna be getting this trade deal. He just said, well, I never said that, the populous thing. And lots of people posted lots of occasions where he had said it. But I don't I don't sort of loathe him in a way that I loathe the liars because I think that I said on the program, I think people like him have always believed in what he tried to achieve with his very Eurosceptic views. I mean, with the interview with John Major, for example, John Redwood challenged John Major because he felt John Major was going the wrong direction on on Europe.\n\nSo I think he's a perfectly honorable kinda guy. I just think he's very, very wrong about a lot of stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Over to you. Questions.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Lord of the sheep. Lord of the sheep? Rory seems a decent person, says lord of the sheep. How does he reconcile his ethics With the harm done to the public as a result of austerity, I have seen it firsthand the harm that's been suffered.\n\nIt cannot be denied. I believe the current mess in our country is largely due to austerity. So I think there was another question about this, Roy, that was about, could you explain lots of people often post on social media, quotes, your voting record. And I I'm giving you an opportunity again to explain why if you're in a government, you have to choose.\n\nSpeaker 1: Look. It's a very good challenge, but this Question around voting record is a question about what political party you belong to. Unfortunately, for better or for worse, in the British political system, You vote with your party. Even rebels, you know, even people who are seen as famous rebels are voting with their parties 95% of the time. But it's even more extreme if you're a government minister because it's a constitutional rule that you have to always vote for the government if you're a government minister because it's called Collective responsibility, ministerial responsibility.\n\nAnd if you don't vote with the government, you resign. And if you don't vote with the government on something important, you're kicked out.\n\nSpeaker 0: On how many occasions did you vote for something as a government minister that had you back had been a backbencher, you'd have felt very, very queasy about?\n\nSpeaker 1: I I never voted for anything that I felt deeply queasy for. I often voted for things that I thought, oh, I'm not quite sure about that. But Yeah. When push came to shove on things I felt very queasy about, I voted against the government, but the result of that was the first time I did it, I was not promoted for the next 4 years. And the 2nd time I did it, I was kicked out of the conservative party.\n\nSo I vote 2 against no deal Brexit. But Yeah. People need to understand that The deal is that it's better or worse a team sport, and the justification for that is that the public vote for a manifesto. They vote for a party, and they expect the party to deliver that manifesto. They don't expect the local MP they voted for to start rebelling against what they think they've signed up for.\n\nAnd we can debate that whether it's a good thing or a bad thing, but that's the way the systems work. So these these these things where they say, look at the voting record, is completely absurd. All you say when you say, yeah. This guy looks like a nice guy, but look at his voting record is what you're saying is This guy looks like an ice guy, but he was a member of a Tory government. That's all you're saying.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But if but when you were not in the government When people sort of raise things on your voting record, is there anything on your voting record when you were a backbencher that you sometimes think, oh, we shouldn't have done that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I think that the way that austerity was done was very, very, it was it was often incredibly damaging, so I saw that very directly in prisons.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: Hacked the, A number of prison officers hacked the budgets of prisons, increased the number of prisoners and ended up with drug filled, violent, filthy, unsafe Presence. So that's a very good example of austerity gone completely wrong. Why did I support the principle? I mean, I you know, that's that goes into the question of how much debt I think the country can handle how much deficit I think the country handle, and I disagree with people who believe that there is an easy way to just Borrow money and spend money and generate growth by doing that, but I guess that's because I was a conservative, not on the other side of the house.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now, Rory, while I'm being the interrogator here, I've got one here from Amy Mention. And would Rory kindly regale us with the story about the time he found himself trapped inside the king's panic room at Highgrove? Then I'll tell you my high growth story.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. So I was, I think, 19 years old, and I had been employed as the tutor To princes William and Harry.\n\nSpeaker 0: For how long?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's for the summer holidays. For the summer holidays. So I had just arrived, and I went off to have a bath about 11 o'clock at night. And weirdly, there were 2 doors on the bathroom. Anyway, I locked the the door that I thought was the right door to lock, got into my bath, got out of the bath, tried to unlock the door, and I couldn't unlock it.\n\nAnd I thought, for goodness' sake, and I kept struggling with the key, and I couldn't shift it. Eventually, there was a knock on the door, and this familiar voice, it's the voice king, but I'm not gonna commit Lacey Mascher's day by trying to imitate the voice of the king. But, anyway, the voice of the king then said, Rory, would you mind turning out the lights out when you go to bed? He obviously cares about the environment, wants to turn lights So I say, I'm really sorry, sir. I'm now very, very scared 19 year old.\n\nIt's my 1st proper job. I'm really sorry, sir. I seem to have locked myself in the loo. And he says, don't be so ridiculous, Rory. Turn the key in the lock.\n\nSo I'm so terrified. I turn the key in the lock so hard that I I snap it off at the haft, And I'm left with this thing. And I then look around, and I said, I'm really, really sorry, sir. I've snapped the key off in the half. And he says, you're not seriously suggesting it's midnight that I have to wake up the whole house and get them to axe down the door?\n\nAnd I say, no. No. No. So it's absolutely fine. I'll I'll sleep the night on the bathroom floor.\n\nThere's there is just so there is a sort of harump from the other kind of the door.\n\nSpeaker 0: And did you sleep there?\n\nSpeaker 1: The Prince of Wales disappears. So I then look around this thing and realize what's happened is that this is the anti terrorist panic room of the building. And there's a big sign up saying ring Scotland Yard and, you know, jump out of the window. And this thing that I've I've locked is this kind of bomb proof metal door to prevent a terrorist getting in. So about 20 minutes later, there is the sound literally of axes on the door.\n\nAnd eventually, the door is broken through and there is the Prince of Wales in this dressing gown directing a group of people with axes driving out, and for the rest of my time at Highgrove, literally, I would sit there at at the breakfast table, the lunch table, And all the people serving me could not stop themselves sniggering every time they try to pour the soup.\n\nSpeaker 0: Listen, Rory. That is just such a great story. I think we should have a separate podcast. The the rest is Rory's time at Highgrove. Right.\n\nBut, listen, I've got a desk quite impressive, though, that he's going around turning the lights off. Is that part of his eco warriordom, that he goes around making sure there's no lights on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I think I think he does care about the environment. Yeah. Are you gonna tell us your high growth story, or are we gonna move on\n\nSpeaker 0: to that? Story is that at one point when Tony and Sheree were going for lunch with the then Prince of Wales at Highgrove, and we were meant to be going on to Coventry. So I was with them in the car behind. And I just texted ahead to one of the protection people and said, look. Can you check out if there's a swimming pool?\n\nSo because while a lot of us swim while Tony's having lunch. And I later discovered this caused absolute sort of protocol consternation because, of course, there is a swimming pool, but only he is meant to swim in it. And I don't think he's I don't think he swims very much. So after a sort of bit of, you know, Republican badgering, eventually, they sort of, you know, rather grumpily agreed that I could go in the swimming pool. But I've got to tell you, I don't know if you ever went in the swimming pool, the highgrove, but it didn't feel like it was Swumming very much.\n\nThere were a lot of green things there.\n\nSpeaker 1: You swum in a lot of unique places. I mean, someday, we need a book out of you on places you swum. Right then. We'll be back in a second, so let's just take a quick break.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now here's a more serious one. Right? We I think we'll both be interested in this. James Moores, what would you say are the key criteria For a country to be considered a superpower, which countries do you believe have the potential to meet that criteria in coming decades? Related to that, Tim Johnson, Why does the UK still deserve a permanent seat on the UN Security Council?\n\nIf the UN was founded now, would the UK be in that same position?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so I think the answer is, of course, if the UN was founded now, the UK would not be likely to be in the same position. I mean, its only claim is that it's a nuclear power, but In population terms, it's very small compared to the global population. Its economy is increasingly small compared to its big competitors like the US and China. Criteria to be a superpower? Well, I guess the the obvious rising powers are China and then India.\n\nAnd I think to be a superpower is really about being able to hyperbolically project your power globally, not just on a regional basis, But be able to bring the full force of your economic and military might to bear almost anywhere around the world. Gon, over to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I yeah. I think that's right. And I think it means that, actually, although we talked during the Cold War about America and Russia or the Soviet Union being superpowers. The Soviet Union was only really a superpower because of the strength of its The size of its military arsenal, in particular, its nuclear arsenal. America, a genuine superpower.\n\nI'd say at the moment China and America are both are the only 2 superpowers. And I think there are others that could emerge in that way. I think it's economic, military, cultural. And it's also it's also really about how they relate relate to the rest of the world. I mean, there's not a single other leader in the world who doesn't, You know, if the phone goes and it's it's the Chinese embassy saying president Xi would like to have this conversation or it's the u the White House president Biden would like to have a conversation, They're kind of the top level.\n\nAnd I do think that the UK I I said this on question time. I really do feel that Brexit has reduced us further, that we're no longer, You know, we're no longer top tier other than, you know, for the historic reasons in the UN. But I think there's a danger that we're we're we're going down, you know, not just from 2nd tier, but lower than that. I think what about the African countries? Do you think any of the African countries could ever emerge\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, 1 in 10 children born in the world will be born in Nigeria by 2050. That actually is a segue into a question from Fred Gray. Friend of mine in the US sent me an email which mentioned a community work program in Rwanda called Umuganda, in Kenya, Rwanda, which means uniting to achieve a common purpose. So this is an amazing event. He's asked whether, either of us have seen it, and I have definitely seen it, and it is for real.\n\nSo on the last Saturday of every month, if you are a citizen without disabilities aged between 18 and 65, You basically have to get out there from 8 in the morning for 3 hours picking up the rubbish and and doing some other stuff too. That's you have community meetings. And, essentially, you you'd get arrested if you're not not picking up the rubbish, and it's incredible. I mean, on a Saturday morning, the traffic is at a complete standstill, And the streets are full of people tidying up the capital city or out in the rural areas having community meetings. And as a result, Rwanda is pretty clean.\n\nIt's like the Switzerland of Africa.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I nearly I nearly got into a, an altercation yesterday when Grace and I were out walking the dog, and she stopped me from confronting these people who were literally just throwing litter. Oh. This is on Hampstead Heath. They were having a sort of picnic type thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: During and you you didn't get an altercation?\n\nSpeaker 0: I didn't because Grace said, no. Please, dad don't, please. We're fed up. We're getting you out of fights. But it was it was just it just disgusted It stitched me so much.\n\nIt was literally she was, like, wiping things and throwing the tissues into the grass, and then her husband or a partner or boyfriend, whatever, necking this bottle of beer, and just chucking it over his shoulder. It does my head in. Now we said on the main podcast we were going to cover this. Dorothy Darling, Disappointing to see Keir Starmer, West Streeting, etcetera, at Murdoch party. Why toady up to him instead of rejecting his poison?\n\nAre they too worried about lack of or negative coverage? I think people will be thrilled to see politicians giving him the cut, prove that they're not just more of the same.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, I mean, I was quite proud not to go to his parties, And and I I thought it was actually a bit embarrassing to do so, but colleagues went, Labour politicians, Conservative politicians because they believe that if they didn't go, I guess they would get negative coverage in the newspapers, didn't they?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think it is about this sort of you know, it's like they I think it's the Murdoch Empire in particular sort of feel that they are almost like a a kind of state, and you have to Treat them like that, and they have diplomats. They have ambassadors around the place. And I do think, I I was pleased that Ed Miliband, when he was leader leader of the Labour Party, really went for them over, you know, over their role in phone hacking and the criminal abuse in the media and so forth. I get why IKEA does it, but I I think there will be quite a lot of people like, Dorothy there who,\n\nSpeaker 1: And why why does he do it? Sorry. Just to For\n\nSpeaker 0: the for the reason for the reasons you said in the main podcast that it's about trying to neutralize something that could be quite a nasty enemy. No. I think there'll be a nasty enemy anyway. I don't think that kid and labor are gonna get a fair deal.\n\nSpeaker 1: And do you really think that if you don't I mean, I didn't turn up, didn't respond to the invitation. Do you think he actually is vindictive against people who don't come to his party?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think it'll be about necessarily vindictive about people who don't who don't go to his his jamborees, but I think vindictive to people who he feels do not Show him what he considers to be respect or who, you know, veer too far away from political views that he deems to be palatable. I I think he's just vindictive, but I think he puts the word out to his papers. You know? Do what you can do this guy in. Final question, Rory.\n\nThis one this one made me laugh. Paul Cuddeford. How does Rory feel when having made a good point, Alastair usually says right in a way that illustrates that he hasn't listened to the point as he's so consumed by what he's about to say. It's not a criticism. I find it quite funny.\n\nIt happens a lot, and I love your work. Let me just tell you, Paul, I say right In that way, when Rory has made a point that I actually think is worth just allowing to stand on its own, unlike Rory, who regularly, after I make a point, says good or very good and then moves on. Is that not true, Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yep. Right. Right. Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's go. Bye bye.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Goodbye.",
