Welcome to The Rest is Politics, Question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And a lot going on, and we've done our emergency pod. People haven't heard it, Which I thought was very exciting. And then we've done our main podcast. And now we've got a lot of questions coming in on huge number of different issues. But one that I thought we'd start with Is doctor w Elliot Boomer. If Scotland were an independent country, and I'm asking this knowing you're both ardent unionists, So I think I'm more of an ardent unionist than I am. I think you're ardent to than I am. So it calls for stretch of imagination. What should be the priorities of the Scottish government? A closer relationship with England or a closer relationship with Europe. If Scotland were independent Mhmm. Interesting. If Scotland were independent, which I don't think is going to happen in my lifetime, If Scotland were independent, they'd have to focus on both. But I think, actually, one of the lessons of Brexit is that they'd have to address an awful lot of complexities about the unraveling of the relationship with the rest of the UK. So I suspect England would be Yeah. That's do you agree with that? That's the paradox, and it's the problem with both Brexit and Scottish independence that The movement is driven by rejection, but then what you have to do is then spend the next few years really focusing on a very, very close ship to get the best relationship you can, which is psychologically difficult because the people that have pushed for independence have amped up The anti English thing. And then you realize that you're gonna have to come to a lot of compromises, a lot of make concessions. I mean, you know, something like 3 quarters of Scotland's Trade business links are are into England, not out to Europe. And it would be very, very, very tough For the Scottish economy, it'd be an amplified version of what Britain went through leaving the European Union. Now you and I were in Dublin together briefly last week. And after you left, I was at a a dinner with some bit of the people who'd been at the event that we were at, and I I did a roundtable show of hands. You know how I love my show of hands? And I was asking them their view as to whether they thought there'd be united Ireland in My lifetime. I think that was the time frame. And not a single hand was raised. Gosh. And I think that is a major shift. And I think the answer the reason for that is part of the I've actually written my new European column about this because I was quite taken aback by it, is I I think the reasons are them looking north and seeing a bit of a basket case with this political stalemate going on, but also looking east to us in Great Britain and thinking, do we really wanna kind of get that much closer? Anyways, very I find it very interesting. And I said to the people there, do think there would have been the same answer 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago? I said, no. Absolutely not. Right. Very interesting. Very interesting. Here's a question from Tommy Heatley. Alastair, would you put Sinn Fein in the column as the 3 p's? So to remind people the 3 p's are populism, polarization, and post truths. And question is, Is Sinn Fein a populist party? And to remind people, in case they've forgotten, Sinn Fein was the political wing of the IRA. Right. And, you know, we we're in the middle of a huge controversies about people chanting Palestine should be free from the River to the Sea. But, of course, the IRA was absolutely committed to destroying the British state in Northern Ireland. Had No. You know? I mean, it's a it's an interesting question about recognizing somebody's right to exist, but certainly, traditionally, Sinn Fein and the IRA did not recognize The right of the British said nor none to exist and was associated with terrorism. So Tommy Heatley says he feels that Sinn Fein are a populist party. FFFG are not perfect. In the Foyle Finnegan. A big Irish political party is not perfect, but I think they're working well together. Sinn Fein seems to have simple answers For very complicated problems, love the pipes of The Late Late Show. And I wanted to pin you on that. What the pipes on The Late Late Show? No. Pipes on The Late Late Show, I think you can just Take us granted. Played The Feals of Athan Rye. We're doing doing you did well on that. I think you often are a bit soft on Sinn Fein, and therefore, you'll be a bit reluctant To acknowledge what most of my Irish friends think, which is they're pretty horrified by it and think people are forgetting their history too quickly and that they are a populist party. I think they are a populist party in that. I think they are offering very simple solutions to incredibly complicated problems. Housing and health of the things that they're really campaigning against the big two on. And I actually think that roundtable, I think part of the reason they may have shifted is because they're actually now, as business community, confronting the possibility, if not probability, that it'll have a Sinn Fein government. And that's how how does that their views on whether or not there's gonna be United Ireland. Well, I I don't know whether that wasn't I wasn't asking them about that, but I wonder whether I because I think that they think that United Ireland is is, like, In a way, independence is a driving mission for the SNP in Scotland, that United Ireland is a driving mission for Shinden Fish and Wildlife. That was that that was that was Yeah. And they'll make a big thing of it in the election. And Whereas the that community that I was with, pretty high heeled, they were all chairs of companies and boards and stuff, that they would be possibly not very favorably disposed towards Sinn Fein from the business perspective. So therefore, that might have colored their judgment in the question of United's hand. And and and just to explain again to listeners, that's because Xinfeng's traditionally seen as a pretty left wing Yeah. Force. Yeah. Yeah. So popularist, yes. Polarizing, I'd say no in that I think they're trying to project themselves in a much more cooperative kind of way. So I don't think I don't think they're going out and saying, If you're not with us, you're a terrible person, which is kind of what polarization is about. And on post truth, I mean, you got to remember, on post truth, you talk about the the old days when the IRA would would be doing all sorts of stuff, and Sinn Fein line was that they they had nothing to do with the IRA. So that that was That was pre post truth in a way. But I think what Mary Lou McDonald as leader and Michelle O'Neill in the North are both trying to do is to project themselves as modern Democratic leaders. So they would I would say they're populist. Some of the Hutit leaders. So they would I would say they're populist. Some of your Irish friends might say they're polarizing and post truth, but I'd say possibly less than they used to be. But But I think one of the uncomfortable questions if we talk about Georgia Maloney, the populist leader in Italy, or Marine Le Pen in France, Is that many oh, be the Swedish Democrats. Many of these parties try to rebrand themselves as being moderate, distance themselves From their slightly Well extreme parts. Le Pen turning up at the Yeah. Anti Semitism march. Part of the question is how much are you prepared to forget about who they were pretty recently and the movements in which these people grew up, how much you prepare to take at face value. Leaders who grew up in those movements suddenly saying, oh, no. Well, nothing to do with that anymore. We're now, you know, friendly press at Templeton. That's that's something that that Fianna Fail and Fianna Gail are having to wrestle with because when I was on The Late Late Show, I was on with this This guy who's a very, very smart guy, he's a he's got a very successful podcast. He's a comedian. He's a writer called Blind Boy who who who wears a plastic bag over his head everywhere he goes because he doesn't want to be recognized when he's out and about. But I was talking about how I think, actually, there's some good politicians in in Ireland. And I was mentioning I thought it was amazing the way that this sort of you know, you've got you've got the 2 main parties in co so that they swap for the role of Tisha from Mehor Martin, now Lia Radka. And he said and he got a laugh for it and a round of applause. As far as I'm concerned, they're just 2 cheeks of the same arse, which is a kinda nice, easy jibe to make. But I think that what Sinn Fein are banking on actually It's for young people in particular confronted with really bad housing, crisis for them literally to forget, Not to know about. So then the FINA4 and the FINA GILL have got to decide, well, do they attack Sinn Fein for those past relations or not? For Joe Biden. It's a question for Keir Starmer, it's the question for Macron. It's a question for shorts in Germany, isn't it? That there could be politicians out there who People admire. I mean, I think we look at Ireland's politicians, we tend to think they're pretty good, pretty serious. Ireland has been a genuine, genuine miracle. I mean, it's now got some of the highest life expectancy educational scores ahead of Europe, one of the highest GDP per capita from a very, very poor base. It's a genuine numerical. It's quite I mean, you're right. There are problems in Ireland like housing, but by and large, my goodness, it's performed well. Oh, yeah. And also this sort of the the progress on the kind of questions of cons so what normally social conservatism, has has been huge as well. And also surprising, not quite as much regional inequality as you get in many European countries. And yet, as you say, the populace can still come in and take on even pretty good, pretty formidable, competent politicians tickets. And destroy them. Mhmm. I think the next Irish election will be really, really interesting, very interesting. And where is where Blind Boy has got a point about, you know, 2 cheeks with the same arse. I mean, I wouldn't phrase it like that, but but I think unless you do know the history of Ireland, actually sort of working out the difference between Fenie Foyle and Finagale. It's not always straightforward. I mean, it's not you know, generally, people would say, oh, well, Vrak is more of a Tory, but it's kinda not as simple as that. Just for my final one on Ireland, what did you make of the Irish president and his position on Palestine? And just remind people what happened there. So the Irish president, Michael Higgins, who's a very, very popular guy and pretty left wing, he made a very, very outspoken statement on what's happening in the Middle East. And, again, I asked the business leaders what they thought and And and he was wearing a Palestinian scarf. Afaz and his scarf. He was very, very strongly you you'd put him on the pro Palestinian side, which historically, Ireland has Yeah. Has always been. I saw an interview in the Israeli Matt's saying that they see Ireland as almost the most difficult country for them to deal with in the whole of the union. I think they see Ireland Ireland and Spain as the most sort of, you know Yeah. They define it as anti Israel. I've got a very good friend in in Ireland who actually does some work with Israel who's who says that it is a difficult place to have this debate. But interestingly, the business leaders again, I did another show of hands on that one, they were they were not happy about that. They felt that that was an overstepping of the president's mark. Very good. Okay. Now how will the US selection impact UK Labour, Andy Byers? Which will be more beneficial for the Labour Party, a general election prior to the US election or after it? Or will the impact of one not affect the other? So let's just think this through. So I suppose there are there are 4 possibilities. There's an election before which Biden wins, an election before which Trump wins, an election after which Biden wins, an election after which Trump wins, Which marginally might be more of a problem for the Labour Party, more of an advantage? I think the ideal for Labour would be an election before which Biden wins, which takes away the this is a sort of major question. It will be a big question. If the president if the American presidential election doesn't happen before, a general election here, then Labour will legitimately and constantly be asked. And, I mean, you could imagine a situation where Labour end up saying, well, we don't comment or interfere in the elections of other countries. I don't think that will happen because I think It'll be so clear that the Labour government would prefer to work with Biden than with Trump. So I would I would say that would be the the the trickiest would be American election before which Trump wins. No. In fact, It might even be in the American election after which Trump wins because, you'd be sort of working with Biden up to the point of, and then that could get very, very Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What about books? Should we talk talk about books? So some this is Gavin Dingwall Dingwall, home of Ross County Football Club. Very good. You knew that, didn't you? I did not until this moment, but that's a very good very good very good very good, insight. Thank you. Alright. So Gavin says, other than your own, what are your favorite Of the many political books that have been published this year, I'm gonna start with a book that wasn't published this year, but which is very relevant this year. And that is a book by my old friend Donald McIntyre, who I'm sure you know, journalist, spent a lot of time in the Middle East, and his book is quite is simply called Gaza. And if you really want to know the history of Gaza, then that is a book worth getting. I'm also gonna give a shout out to Chris Bryant for his book Code of Conduct. Similar theme, Ian Dunnt, How Westminster Works and Why It Doesn't. And I think a book I've mentioned on the podcast before, Russell Jones, wrote a book called The Tyranny of Nostalgia, which is a really, really good analysis of why our economy is not as strong as it should be. Well, so my my recommendations on politics more broadly, I did a I did an event yesterday with Mary Beard, who's just written a book called Emperor of Rome, and we had a really Oh, Rory, before you go on Yeah. Before we go on, we had a question a couple of weeks ago, which we didn't get around to, but also I was also asked this by somebody called Alice in the swimming pool the other day. Mhmm. Very keen listener to the podcast, said she'd love to ask you in in particular. How often do you think about the Roman Empire? It's a weird question, isn't it? That's But it's being asked a lot about it, though, right? Well, I mean, I obviously think about it a lot. So How How many times a day would you think about the Roman Empire? Oh, 5 or 6? Really? Yeah. Yeah. I think about the Roman Empire a lot. Yep. Mary Beard and I had a very detailed discussion, about Roman emperors yesterday for an hour and a half, on a on a stage at the Cadogan Hall. So yesterday, you thought about it a lot. I thought about it a great deal, and people interest in it. So Mary Beard, who people will know, has written a beautiful book, not about specific emperors, but about the nature of power in Rome and the way in which power is playacting, The role of women in Roman politics. Because, of course, women were not emperors, never became emperors. And I think it's It's it's I think she was actually really good on this stage at thinking about some of the echoes between Roman politics and British politics. Including today? Including today. Yeah. I suppose I suppose bringing Cameron back is sort of we describe it as being Victorian, but We could probably go back even though about the Romans get in. Couple of AI books if people haven't particularly been picking up on that from people we've interviewed on Leading. And if you haven't heard, do listen to them. The Suleiman's coming wave and weeks. Book is getting a lot of love in the bookshops. Yep. I noticed. Reid Hoffman's impromptu, which he wrote with Chert GBT. Yeshemonk Mhmm. Who I think we've we've talked about getting on the podcast, and I think we should at some point, has written a really powerful book called The Great Experiment. And Yashamank is very interested in 2 different types of things at the moment. He's very interested in the way that Immigration works, multicultural societies are formed, and he challenges the populist far right on that. He's also very interesting, though, increasingly on challenging the far left On identity politics. In some ways, we should get him on, but he's trying to stand up for a vision of liberalism, which is neither National identity politics nor other forms of identity politics. The the book I'm most looking forward to Yep. Next year is, I'm not giving up on my attempts to get Angela Merkel onto the podcast. That would be a real And I know that, one of her key advisers is a regular listener. Very good. Sir Merkel is not doing interviews at the moment because she's writing her book and memoirs, which I think will be a great read. Yeah. Let me let me put in a final plug for a book that I've just finished, which hasn't yet been published, was about to come out, and people can preorder by Gary Stevenson called Trading Game. Gary Stevenson, working class guy from London who became a currency trader in a bank Just before 2008, and it is the most chilling, terrifying account of the madness of Those banks and their culture. I mean, I sometimes you know, there I am thinking politics is the most obnoxious, disgusting, bullying, horrifying Game of the world. But when he describes these city traders in full roar, you see something absolutely appalling. I mean, both the way that he was treated by Citibank, The way in which they blew up the economy, the way in which they made money, the way in which their bonuses are just the culture, the day to day culture of those trading floors. So Gary Stevenson, Trading Game. Now we should just say that lots of people I know will have got your book and my last book through Coles Books, which is a fantastic bookshop down in Bicester. And any of the books that we mention on the podcast, at any time, you can get 10% off at Coles Books by becoming a trip plus member, and see all the books we mention every week by signing up to the newsletter. Let's take a break. Welcome back to the rest of this politics question time with me, Alastair Campbell. And with me, Rory Stewart. And a plug For our leading interview with Comfort Iroh, who is a British Nigerian, who is the head of International Crisis Group, And gave us, I thought, a stunning interview looking at crises around the world, an amazing introduction to the complexity of the world today. What did you say? And I really enjoyed it. Really enjoyed it. Her work is meant to be about the crisis group who's just trying to prevent crises. There are lots of crises that have not been prevented. I don't think we could put the blame entirely out of the door at all. Yeah. But there was a lot to talk about. And and it was a reminder of even though we pride ourselves on talking about stuff that much of the British mainstream media doesn't focus on. There's an awful lot of other stuff that Goodness sakes. You just can't we don't have time for. You know, she got us into Haiti and the Philippines and Venezuela. Yemen and all these different places. And I'm also I'm particular I'm really looking forward to Another leading interviewee that we've got coming up, which is Tony Klug. This is a guy who's who's represented both sides in the in the Middle East piece process debate. So I'm looking forward to that. Great. Looking forward to that too. Thomas Vandeville, can you give your insights on the upcoming Dutch election and why Onzt and his new party, NSC, are doing so well in the polls. Have you been following this at all? No. Can't tell us about that. Well, this guy, Peter Omsigt, is a sort of, center right kind of politician who's set up a new party, the new social contract, a few months ago, and he's currently leading the polls. And this is an election that was caused by Mark Rutter. His coalition collapsed. I think he's, like, I think he's onto his 4th coalition, Bill I. Merkel, But he's now not standing, so you've got all the all the leaders who are standing for the main parties are new. You got this new party. You've got Franz, Timmermann, European commissioner who's leading a kind of left, labor green sort of coalition. But Om OmSeekt is doing really, really well in the polls. And And what do they stand for? And what do they do? They they're quenching that he he's he's from the sort of center right background, but he's more left wing on some issues. Queues. So he's kind of he's a sentry. He's he's And is he seen as a sort of macro figure? I don't think he's a macro figure. And also, interestingly, he said that he doesn't intend to be prime minister. So he's saying he's leading the party. Vote for the party, and then they're going to decide who'll be prime minister. He's not come out of nowhere in terms of being quite well known in the Netherlands, But his but his party has literally just been formed almost for this election. So it's got elements of Macron. What what but but what's what's the platform? Why is he so hugely popular? What's the thing? What are they fed up with? What are they doing? What's the what do voters want him? Because he's basically saying he's sensible in the economy, but look after people kind of thing, and, You know, fairly obvious stuff, but in a You wouldn't thought you can blow up a political system with that kind of message. Bringing it up because one of the problems that has led to this election is the that that small parties can emerge and and do very, very well. And if you look at if you look at the full list, I haven't got it in front of me, but take a look at full list of all the parties that are standing. I mean, there are so many of them, but they will get some votes. And, you know, because it's a portion representation, some of them will end up in in parliament. But it's a very, very interesting one. And, you know, maybe because Mark Rutte was there and was seen as quite a strong figure and he held things together, Him going, I think, has possibly just opened up the space for people to look at other people differently. Franz Timmerman as well is doing is doing pretty well. Who we may get onto the podcast? I would love to hear on the forecast, and we definitely will. If he becomes prime minister, we'd like to have mister Peter Omsicht. And and and I can I can I can try my 1 sentence of Dutch out on it? That's very good. That's very good. You remind us of your 1 sentence You kept the field. My daughters are built. No. That is impressive. Yeah. Do you know what it means? No? I played my bagpipes too much. Very good. Very good. That evidence is true as well as Peter Omsik. We should keep tabs on that and maybe talk about it again after the event, but Peter Olmsik, definitely worth watching. Is Githin has written to us saying, are Haig and Miliband the most influential politicians in the UK? Are there disastrous changes to leadership elections within their parties, largely to blame for Brexit, Johnson, Corbyn trust, has seen that said clever? Initially, I thought this was a question about whether when they should be brought David Miliband should be brought back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's about Ed Miliband and Willie May. And let me start on that. I absolutely agree with these questions. I think the changes to the leadership elections that allowed Boris Johnson to come through, allowed, Jeremy Corbyn to come through, Allowing this trust to come through were catastrophic. And at least the way the conservative party used to organize There's things before these Hague reforms, which allowed the MPs who actually work day in, day out with these people, knew That Boris Johnson was somebody who could not be trusted and would not have voted for him, I think, if they hadn't sensed that the power of labor, the party, and the party in the country would vote for him was a much better system. And, you can also make a democratic argument for it. I mean, it's difficult, sometimes to get their head around. But the point is that At least the MPs are elected. Whereas the members of the conservative party in the country, 2 a half 1000000 when my mother was a member in 19 fifties, Now, only just over a 100,000 members, and they get effectively to select the prime minister. So this is totally Much less democratic. Even though it's more people than the MPs, it's much less democratic because unlike the MPs, senator likes it. So Yeah. I would like to return to a system where the MPs chose the leader. Yeah. Well, it's it's interesting because this is where sometimes you have to be honest with people about the limitations of of the franchise and democracy and the the systems that you have. I remember Bruce Grocott, who is now in the House of Lords and was Tony's parliamentary private secretary. And I remember at the time of the changes in labor system that he was saying, oh, this this is not this is not sensible. This is not clever. The one thing the MPs always have in mind First of all, they know the contenders better, and secondly, they have a a broader interest in making sure they try to get the right person. Whereas members will be a little bit if anything, more divorced from where real public opinion might be. So he was always very, very, very against this. I remember that. And and, of course, it's a hard thing to argue against, what you're saying that the members shouldn't have a say. Well, no, we're not saying Just an issue that was bigger, say, as the MPs. And, of course, the other problem is that a lot of MPs aren't terribly well respected in their communities. But I I broadly agree with you. I I I think that the that both the main parties should have another look at how they elect their leaders. Lucy Bishop, I'm a politics student at UCL looking at what my next steps are for a life in the political sphere, particularly in foreign policy and diplomacy. Do I need a master's civil service fast stream? Any advice based on the requirements and skills needed before I start my career? So I'd say couple of things on that, and maybe this is just too much my own experience. The first is, I would really recommend, if you wanna work in foreign policy, getting out and spending some time living in a foreign country and ideally in a country in the global south and in a rural area where you're in somewhere very, very different. Because one of the biggest challenges in foreign policy Understanding what life is like outside the capital city in a remote rural area in a developing country. So spend a year there. Secondly, I could not recommend the civil service Fast Stream more. It was life changing for me. That 5 years I spent gave me so much of the basic skills of organizing myself, running meetings. How hard is it to get on to? It's a competitive exam, but it's a pretty fair meritocratic exam. In the days when I did it, it It was largely an IQ test, basically, a long IQ test. And then the final stage, you were given some exercises on doing some paper and sharing committees. But I for the rest of my life, even, you know, setting up a charity, it was drawing on that 5 years basic experience I had in the civil service just set me up for life. Now listen. This is definitely one for you. Ned Gibbons, why is the far right of the conservative party so powerful? The way I see it, their only way out of the current message is to move towards the center, but many in the party want to head further to the right. What's am I missing? Another question, amazing grace, not my daughter, currently appearing in New York, by the way, at the Soho Playhouse, And it's not her, though. Why do the ERG and the right wing of the Tory party hold so much power and sway over their leadership? Are they in the majority? What is it that makes the prime minister's dance to their tune? Well, it's actually not very different from the power that the the left had with Corbyn and the Labour Party. It's partly that, the Tory party members are older and more right wing than the general population. It's partly that Boris Johnson bucked the trend in the 2019 election where he got an over 80 seat majority by tilting to the right when the conventional wisdom is that you should fight in the center. But more than any of that, it's that people who are very ideologically charged, people who spend their time in echo chamber Talking to each other, it doesn't matter whether it's Corbynistas with their own particular socialist version of Britain or whether it's right wing conservatives with their particular I don't know what it is quite. I mean, with Liz Truss, it's a sort of distorted tribute act to Margaret Thatcher. With others, it's kinda nationalism. But whatever it is, they Operate in an echo chamber. They talk to their party members. They convince themselves that everybody in the country agrees with them. And in the case of both Corbyn supporters And sort of Boris Johnson, this trust supporters. Of course, sometimes they're right. There are often things that the center ground politicians aren't concentrating on that the public really care about. Mhmm. So Corbyn was absolutely right to say that the public were very, very angry about the 2008 Financial crisis in the way that the banks got away with things and that no centrist party was really gripping that. And, unfortunately, I think it probably is True that the right of the conservative party has caught on to something when they think that there's a lot of concern amongst the public about immigration. So there will be things that they say which resonate with people, which convince them they're right about everything. Mhmm. But the major problem is the way that they can hold the balance of power out Out of all proportion to their numbers, so this horrible group from my point of view, at least, during Brexit called the Spartans led by Marc Francois, who eventually were reduced to a rump of barely kind of 30 people, in the end, were able to control the whole party because that was the 30 votes it was Well, I I saw last night, I was sort of channel hopping a bit last night, and John Craig on Sky News was reporting from outside this meeting of the so called new conservatives who'd been briefing that they were the new power in the land. And he said, sort of count on 2 hands how many MPs were there. I think they overstate their power, and And their power is given. When they say, why did the prime ministers dance to their tunes? It's the fact of the prime ministers dancing to the tunes that gives them their power. And what you've seen post Corbyn with Keir Starmer clearly going in a different direction is that erodes their power. And I think you'll see that now with This is why Soon actually have done this right at the start. I think what he's done with bringing back Cameron is is is going to erode their power. And I suspect before too long, I'll make a prediction that while the other hard right figure, Farage, is making a complete idius of himself in What? 1,200,000 Concannon, Fantastic. 1,500,000. Yeah. I was offered 1,000,000 at one point. Yeah. And you don't think for 1.5, you might change your mind that I'm a celebrity. I wouldn't. No. I think the tragedy look. If for Farage is not stupid, right, and he's probably yes. He likes money. Okay? So he's gone there. He's making a lot of money. But I actually do think this is part of his rehabilitation into the Conservative Party. And just like Trump made his political name on reality TV, Raj is thinking the same the same game. And what I keep saying to people, any audience that's willing to listen, if we don't get serious about our apologies again, We are finished. And what this says, if we now reward somebody and the lesson the lesson for the arm of celebrity thing is, I mean, Hancock Matt Hancock did not to help his reputation. I hope Farage doesn't help his reputation because I think what the public should say, you're either a serious political figure or you're not, But you can't go down and do stupid reality TV shows and remain a political serious political figure. But that's his game. So I think the right's power will see itself eroded. And this is how leadership is meant to work. You set a course, and then you try and take people with you. Whereas what Sunak has done since he became prime minister is allow his course to be set by everybody else. It's so difficult, though, isn't it? I I always feel that you are in a tight rope in politics because we push it too far, You can be toppled. For sure. And and in the end, Theresa May was brought down by by the right she couldn't she she tried to confront them maybe too late. Maybe she didn't do it in the right way, but in the end, They took her down, and they brought in Boris Johnson. But you're absolutely right. Equally, sometimes you face them down in the way that Keir Sama seems to have done with the left of the Labour Party, And it's gone much better for him than many of the Corbynistas would have predicted. Presumably, many of them would have thought, he's never gonna get away with that. We're gonna destroy him if he does this. And he did get away with it. And if you if you think about when Jeremy Corbyn was was leave of the Labour Party, okay. So John McDonald is still around, and you see him from time to time. And but there there was a kind of So a dozen MPs who for a time were kind of household names. They were never off the television screen. Well, they're now never on it. And I think that's because there's a different course which is being tracked and people are gathering around that. Now listen, here's one I I really want to to ask because, one, I like the of her asking it in this way, Ginny Smith, from the editorial team of Sussex Bylines, one of 10 regional titles in the Bylines network of online newspapers. How important do you think citizen journalism is becoming in combating the mainstream right wing bias and giving local communities a voice? Very. And I I'm a bit of a fan of the Bylines group. I think they do. Yes. They are broadly in the same political space as I am, I guess, but I think they, you know, they call out all sides. But I think it's good that we're we're getting these new sort of voices out there. That I put the new European in the same category. I I think that the, you know, new voices that are not part of this kind of right wing media mix, which I think has done massive damage to the country and to our culture. So, yeah, big fan, Ginny. Carry on. Keep up the good work. Last question for me. Katrina Shepherd, UBI. Last week, Rory outlined how cash given directly transformed homelessness. Perhaps did you discuss your take on how a universal So basic income might work to grow the economy, eradicate poverty, redistribute wealth, and access resources, and might the Labour Party ever consider it? I was thinking we were joking yesterday about Legacy. And I failed to say that if I really was dreaming of a legacy, a legacy I would love to have It's being associated with the generation that ended extreme poverty globally. I mean, it remains unbelievably shocking that there are over 700,000,000 who cannot meet their most basic ends, who are eating once or twice a day, who are dying very young, living in completely unsuitable accommodation, whose kids are not etcetera. So on an international basis, I think the idea of cash transfers to lift people out of poverty is very strong. But I also think in a domestic context, there is more and more evidence that generous, Unconditional cash transfers can really transform the lives of people caught in poverty. And I'm very interested in this because labor can be a bit uneven on this. On the one hand, strong socialist tradition of Wanting to tackle inequality and care for the poor. On the other hand, sometimes a temptation to sound pretty kinda macho and aggressive On benefits, cheating, and this kind of stuff. Mhmm. What where do you think Labour's likely to go on this? Can we expect Some fresh radical thinking around addressing poverty in Britain? Well, I think on the universal basic income, Katrina's question, I think I'm right. I could be wrong about this. I'm gonna mention another book now, but Ed Miliband's book, Go Big. I can't remember whether this I think this was one of the sort of proposals that he was at least saying, let's look at this. And he was giving some sort of analysis as to why this might be a good thing. I can't see Labour going for it in this next manifesto. But I think it's one of those things that's that's on the agenda. Interestingly, I think Elon Musk was talking about this as well because of law. A lot of the Silicon Valley people like it because they think that AI is gonna lead to mass unemployment Yeah. And a lot of redistribution of wealth towards the Elon Musk's world, at which point taxing them And giving a universal basic income to people would be the only solution if you ended up with Matt Sutton Punzmann. Where I am, and I I sort of blow hot and cold on this, on the one hand, I can see the the logic, and the and I can see the political attraction as well. On the other hand, I can see a lot of the difficulties. Do you know what? I think we should do a special on this at some point. Very good. I think we should get a couple of people in. Yep. To do UBI? Yeah. I think I think I think it's a really, really Maybe some of these big ideas. Maybe I think that's a great idea. Or maybe we Could get someone on the UBI and Yashimank at the same time or something like that where we could get, I ideas radical ideas on on direction of modern democracies. Yeah. Good. Excellent. Well, on that commitment to yet another workload, for the rest is politics. I remember, well, I don't know what I said when I first went to you, Robyn. I know when I was first approached by this. It won't be more than a few hours a week. It'll just be able to fit around everything else. Yep. It's it's getting it's getting a lot. I I've Very kindly, occasionally, I get approached by, headhunters trying to convince me to be chairs of boards. And they always say to me Yeah. Couple of hours. Yes. Yeah. Couple of hours. And then he talks to the previous board chair, and he's like, you couldn't do it. I took it all the way. 8 days a month, and you're like, oh. Anyway, not that we don't enjoy it, Rory. Not that we don't enjoy it. We love it. Thank you all for your wonderful questions. All the best. See you all next week. Bye bye.",

People haven't heard it, Which I thought was very exciting. And then we've done our main podcast. And now we've got a lot of questions coming in on huge number of different issues. But one that I thought we'd start with Is doctor w Elliot Boomer.\n\nIf Scotland were an independent country, and I'm asking this knowing you're both ardent unionists, So I think I'm more of an ardent unionist than I am.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think you're ardent to than I am.\n\nSpeaker 1: So it calls for stretch of imagination. What should be the priorities of the Scottish government? A closer relationship with England or a closer relationship with Europe.\n\nSpeaker 0: If Scotland were independent Mhmm. Interesting. If Scotland were independent, which I don't think is going to happen in my lifetime, If Scotland were independent, they'd have to focus on both. But I think, actually, one of the lessons of Brexit is that they'd have to address an awful lot of complexities about the unraveling of the relationship with the rest of the UK. So I suspect England would be\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's do you\n\nSpeaker 0: agree with that?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's the paradox, and it's the problem with both Brexit and Scottish independence that The movement is driven by rejection, but then what you have to do is then spend the next few years really focusing on a very, very close ship to get the best relationship you can, which is psychologically difficult because the people that have pushed for independence have amped up The anti English thing. And then you realize that you're gonna have to come to a lot of compromises, a lot of make concessions. I mean, you know, something like 3 quarters of Scotland's Trade business links are are into England, not out to Europe. And it would be very, very, very tough For the Scottish economy, it'd be an amplified version of what Britain went through leaving the European Union.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now you and I were in Dublin together briefly last week. And after you left, I was at a a dinner with some bit of the people who'd been at the event that we were at, and I I did a roundtable show of hands. You know how I love my show of hands? And I was asking them their view as to whether they thought there'd be united Ireland in My lifetime. I think that was the time frame.\n\nAnd not a single hand was raised.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gosh.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I think that is a major shift. And I think the answer the reason for that is part of the I've actually written my new European column about this because I was quite taken aback by it, is I I think the reasons are them looking north and seeing a bit of a basket case with this political stalemate going on, but also looking east to us in Great Britain and thinking, do we really wanna kind of get that much closer? Anyways, very I find it very interesting. And I said to the people there, do think there would have been the same answer 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago? I said, no.\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Very interesting. Very interesting. Here's a question from Tommy Heatley. Alastair, would you put Sinn Fein in the column as the 3 p's?\n\nSo to remind people the 3 p's are populism, polarization, and post truths. And question is, Is Sinn Fein a populist party? And to remind people, in case they've forgotten, Sinn Fein was the political wing of the IRA. Right. And, you know, we we're in the middle of a huge controversies about people chanting Palestine should be free from the River to the Sea.\n\nBut, of course, the IRA was absolutely committed to destroying the British state in Northern Ireland. Had No. You know? I mean, it's a it's an interesting question about recognizing somebody's right to exist, but certainly, traditionally, Sinn Fein and the IRA did not recognize The right of the British said nor none to exist and was associated with terrorism. So Tommy Heatley says he feels that Sinn Fein are a populist party.\n\nFFFG are not perfect.\n\nSpeaker 0: In the Foyle Finnegan.\n\nSpeaker 1: A big Irish political party is not perfect, but I think they're working well together. Sinn Fein seems to have simple answers For very complicated problems, love the pipes of The Late Late Show. And I wanted to pin you on that.\n\nSpeaker 0: What the pipes on The Late Late Show?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Pipes on The Late Late Show, I think you can just Take us granted.\n\nSpeaker 0: Played The Feals of Athan Rye.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're doing doing you did well on that. I think you often are a bit soft on Sinn Fein, and therefore, you'll be a bit reluctant To acknowledge what most of my Irish friends think, which is they're pretty horrified by it and think people are forgetting their history too quickly and that they are a populist party.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think they are a populist party in that. I think they are offering very simple solutions to incredibly complicated problems. Housing and health of the things that they're really campaigning against the big two on. And I actually think that roundtable, I think part of the reason they may have shifted is because they're actually now, as business community, confronting the possibility, if not probability, that it'll have a Sinn Fein government.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's how how does that their views on whether or not there's gonna be United Ireland.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I don't know whether that wasn't I wasn't asking them about that, but I wonder whether I because I think that they think that United Ireland is is, like, In a way, independence is a driving mission for the SNP in Scotland, that United Ireland is a driving mission for Shinden Fish and Wildlife. That was\n\nSpeaker 1: that that was\n\nSpeaker 0: that was Yeah. And they'll make a big thing of it in the election. And Whereas the that community that I was with, pretty high heeled, they were all chairs of companies and boards and stuff, that they would be possibly not very favorably disposed towards Sinn Fein from the business perspective. So therefore, that might have colored their judgment in the question of United's hand. And and\n\nSpeaker 1: and just to explain again to listeners, that's because Xinfeng's traditionally seen as a pretty left wing Yeah. Force. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So popularist, yes. Polarizing, I'd say no in that I think they're trying to project themselves in a much more cooperative kind of way. So I don't think I don't think they're going out and saying, If you're not with us, you're a terrible person, which is kind of what polarization is about. And on post truth, I mean, you got to remember, on post truth, you talk about the the old days when the IRA would would be doing all sorts of stuff, and Sinn Fein line was that they they had nothing to do with the IRA.\n\nSo that that was That was pre post truth in a way. But I think what Mary Lou McDonald as leader and Michelle O'Neill in the North are both trying to do is to project themselves as modern Democratic leaders. So they would I would say they're populist. Some of the Hutit leaders. So they would I would say they're populist.\n\nSome of your Irish friends might say they're polarizing and post truth, but I'd say possibly less than they used to be.\n\nSpeaker 1: But But I think one of the uncomfortable questions if we talk about Georgia Maloney, the populist leader in Italy, or Marine Le Pen in France, Is that many oh, be the Swedish Democrats. Many of these parties try to rebrand themselves as being moderate, distance themselves From their slightly Well extreme parts.\n\nSpeaker 0: Le Pen turning up at the Yeah. Anti Semitism march.\n\nSpeaker 1: Part of the question is how much are you prepared to forget about who they were pretty recently and the movements in which these people grew up, how much you prepare to take at face value. Leaders who grew up in those movements suddenly saying, oh, no. Well, nothing to do with that anymore. We're now, you know, friendly press\n\nSpeaker 0: at Templeton. That's that's something that that Fianna Fail and Fianna Gail are having to wrestle with because when I was on The Late Late Show, I was on with this This guy who's a very, very smart guy, he's a he's got a very successful podcast. He's a comedian. He's a writer called Blind Boy who who who wears a plastic bag over his head everywhere he goes because he doesn't want to be recognized when he's out and about. But I was talking about how I think, actually, there's some good politicians in in Ireland.\n\nAnd I was mentioning I thought it was amazing the way that this sort of you know, you've got you've got the 2 main parties in co so that they swap for the role of Tisha from Mehor Martin, now Lia Radka. And he said and he got a laugh for it and a round of applause. As far as I'm concerned, they're just 2 cheeks of the same arse, which is a kinda nice, easy jibe to make. But I think that what Sinn Fein are banking on actually It's for young people in particular confronted with really bad housing, crisis for them literally to forget, Not to know about. So then the FINA4 and the FINA GILL have got to decide, well, do they attack Sinn Fein for those past\n\nSpeaker 1: relations or not? For Joe Biden. It's a question for Keir Starmer, it's the question for Macron. It's a question for shorts in Germany, isn't it? That there could be politicians out there who People admire.\n\nI mean, I think we look at Ireland's politicians, we tend to think they're pretty good, pretty serious. Ireland has been a genuine, genuine miracle. I mean, it's now got some of the highest life expectancy educational scores ahead of Europe, one of the highest GDP per capita from a very, very poor base. It's a genuine numerical. It's quite I mean, you're right.\n\nThere are problems in Ireland like housing, but by and large, my goodness, it's performed well.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah. And also this sort of the the progress on the kind of questions of cons so what normally social conservatism, has has been huge as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And also surprising, not quite as much regional inequality as you get in many European countries. And yet, as you say, the populace can still come in and take on even pretty good, pretty formidable, competent politicians tickets. And destroy them. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the next Irish election will be really, really interesting, very interesting. And where is where Blind Boy has got a point about, you know, 2 cheeks with the same arse. I mean, I wouldn't phrase it like that, but but I think unless you do know the history of Ireland, actually sort of working out the difference between Fenie Foyle and Finagale. It's not always straightforward. I mean, it's not you know, generally, people would say, oh, well, Vrak is more of a Tory, but it's kinda not as simple as that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just for my final one on Ireland, what did you make of the Irish president and his position on Palestine? And just remind people what happened there.\n\nSpeaker 0: So the Irish president, Michael Higgins, who's a very, very popular guy and pretty left wing, he made a very, very outspoken statement on what's happening in the Middle East. And, again, I asked the business leaders what they thought\n\nSpeaker 1: and And and he was wearing a Palestinian scarf.\n\nSpeaker 0: Afaz and his scarf. He was very, very strongly you you'd put him on the pro Palestinian side, which historically, Ireland has Yeah. Has always been.\n\nSpeaker 1: I saw an interview in the Israeli Matt's saying that they see Ireland as almost the most difficult country for them to deal with in\n\nSpeaker 0: the whole of the union. I think they see Ireland Ireland and Spain as the most sort of, you know Yeah. They define it as anti Israel. I've got a very good friend in in Ireland who actually does some work with Israel who's who says that it is a difficult place to have this debate. But interestingly, the business leaders again, I did another show of hands on that one, they were they were not happy about that.\n\nThey felt that that was an overstepping of the president's mark.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Now how will the US selection impact UK Labour, Andy Byers? Which will be more beneficial for the Labour Party, a general election prior to the US election or after it? Or will the impact of one not affect the other?\n\nSo let's just think this through. So I suppose there are there are 4 possibilities. There's an election before which Biden wins, an election before which Trump wins, an election after which Biden wins, an election after which Trump wins, Which marginally might be more of a problem for the Labour Party, more of an advantage?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the ideal for Labour would be an election before which Biden wins, which takes away the this is a sort of major question. It will be a big question. If the president if the American presidential election doesn't happen before, a general election here, then Labour will legitimately and constantly be asked. And, I mean, you could imagine a situation where Labour end up saying, well, we don't comment or interfere in the elections of other countries. I don't think that will happen because I think It'll be so clear that the Labour government would prefer to work with Biden than with Trump.\n\nSo I would I would say that would be the the the trickiest would be American election before which Trump wins. No. In fact, It might even be in the American election after which Trump wins because, you'd be sort of working with Biden up to the point of, and then that could get very, very\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: What about books? Should we talk talk about books? So some this is Gavin Dingwall Dingwall, home of Ross County Football Club.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: You knew that, didn't you?\n\nSpeaker 1: I did not until this moment, but that's a very good very good very good very good, insight. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. So Gavin says, other than your own, what are your favorite Of the many political books that have been published this year, I'm gonna start with a book that wasn't published this year, but which is very relevant this year. And that is a book by my old friend Donald McIntyre, who I'm sure you know, journalist, spent a lot of time in the Middle East, and his book is quite is simply called Gaza. And if you really want to know the history of Gaza, then that is a book worth getting. I'm also gonna give a shout out to Chris Bryant for his book Code of Conduct.\n\nSimilar theme, Ian Dunnt, How Westminster Works and Why It Doesn't. And I think a book I've mentioned on the podcast before, Russell Jones, wrote a book called The Tyranny of Nostalgia, which is a really, really good analysis of why our economy is not as strong as it should be.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so my my recommendations on politics more broadly, I did a I did an event yesterday with Mary Beard, who's just written a book called Emperor of Rome, and we had a really\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, Rory, before you go on Yeah. Before we go on, we had a question a couple of weeks ago, which we didn't get around to, but also I was also asked this by somebody called Alice in the swimming pool the other day. Mhmm. Very keen listener to the podcast, said she'd love to ask you in in particular. How often do you think about the Roman Empire?\n\nIt's a weird question, isn't it? That's But it's being asked a lot about it, though, right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I mean, I obviously think about it a lot. So How\n\nSpeaker 0: How many times a day would you think about the Roman Empire?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, 5 or 6?\n\nSpeaker 0: Really? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think about the Roman Empire a lot. Yep. Mary Beard and I had a very detailed discussion, about Roman emperors yesterday for an hour and a half, on a on a stage at the Cadogan Hall.\n\nSpeaker 0: So yesterday, you thought about it a lot. I\n\nSpeaker 1: thought about it a great deal, and people interest in it. So Mary Beard, who people will know, has written a beautiful book, not about specific emperors, but about the nature of power in Rome and the way in which power is playacting, The role of women in Roman politics. Because, of course, women were not emperors, never became emperors. And I think it's It's it's I think she was actually really good on this stage at thinking about some of the echoes between Roman politics and British politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: Including today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Including today.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I suppose I suppose bringing Cameron back is sort of we describe it as being Victorian, but We could probably go back even though\n\nSpeaker 1: about the Romans get in. Couple of AI books if people haven't particularly been picking up on that from people we've interviewed on Leading. And if you haven't heard, do listen to them. The Suleiman's coming wave and weeks.\n\nSpeaker 0: Book is getting a lot of love in the bookshops.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. I noticed. Reid Hoffman's impromptu, which he wrote with Chert GBT. Yeshemonk\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who I think we've we've talked about getting on the podcast, and I think we should at some point, has written a really powerful book called The Great Experiment. And Yashamank is very interested in 2 different types of things at the moment. He's very interested in the way that Immigration works, multicultural societies are formed, and he challenges the populist far right on that. He's also very interesting, though, increasingly on challenging the far left On identity politics. In some ways, we should get him on, but he's trying to stand up for a vision of liberalism, which is neither National identity politics nor other forms of identity politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: The the book I'm most looking forward to Yep. Next year is, I'm not giving up on my attempts to get Angela Merkel onto the podcast.\n\nSpeaker 1: That would be a real\n\nSpeaker 0: And I know that, one of her key advisers is a regular listener.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very\n\nSpeaker 0: good. Sir Merkel is not doing interviews at the moment because she's writing her book and memoirs, which I think will be a great read.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let me let me put in a final plug for a book that I've just finished, which hasn't yet been published, was about to come out, and people can preorder by Gary Stevenson called Trading Game. Gary Stevenson, working class guy from London who became a currency trader in a bank Just before 2008, and it is the most chilling, terrifying account of the madness of Those banks and their culture. I mean, I sometimes you know, there I am thinking politics is the most obnoxious, disgusting, bullying, horrifying Game of the world. But when he describes these city traders in full roar, you see something absolutely appalling.\n\nI mean, both the way that he was treated by Citibank, The way in which they blew up the economy, the way in which they made money, the way in which their bonuses are just the culture, the day to day culture of those trading floors. So Gary Stevenson, Trading Game.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now we should just say that lots of people I know will have got your book and my last book through Coles Books, which is a fantastic bookshop down in Bicester. And any of the books that we mention on the podcast, at any time, you can get 10% off at Coles Books by becoming a trip plus member, and see all the books we mention every week by signing up to the newsletter.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's take a break.\n\nSpeaker 0: Welcome back to the rest of this politics question time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with me, Rory Stewart. And a plug For our leading interview with Comfort Iroh, who is a British Nigerian, who is the head of International Crisis Group, And gave us, I thought, a stunning interview looking at crises around the world, an amazing introduction to the complexity of the world today. What did you say?\n\nSpeaker 0: And I really enjoyed it. Really enjoyed it. Her work is meant to be about the crisis group who's just trying to prevent crises. There are lots of crises that have not been prevented. I don't think we could put the blame\n\nSpeaker 1: entirely out of the door\n\nSpeaker 0: at all. Yeah. But there was a lot to talk about. And and it was a reminder of even though we pride ourselves on talking about stuff that much of the British mainstream media doesn't focus on. There's an awful lot of other stuff that\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodness sakes.\n\nSpeaker 0: You just can't we don't have time for.\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, she got us into Haiti and the Philippines and Venezuela.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yemen and all these different places. And I'm also I'm particular I'm really looking forward to Another leading interviewee that we've got coming up, which is Tony Klug. This is a guy who's who's represented both sides in the in the Middle East piece process debate. So I'm looking forward to that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great. Looking forward to that too.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thomas Vandeville, can you give your insights on the upcoming Dutch election and why Onzt and his new party, NSC, are doing so well in the polls. Have you been following this at all?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Can't tell us about that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, this guy, Peter Omsigt, is a sort of, center right kind of politician who's set up a new party, the new social contract, a few months ago, and he's currently leading the polls. And this is an election that was caused by Mark Rutter. His coalition collapsed. I think he's, like, I think he's onto his 4th coalition, Bill I. Merkel, But he's now not standing, so you've got all the all the leaders who are standing for the main parties are new.\n\nYou got this new party. You've got Franz, Timmermann, European commissioner who's leading a kind of left, labor green sort of coalition. But Om OmSeekt is doing really, really well in the polls.\n\nSpeaker 1: And And what do they stand for? And what do they do? They\n\nSpeaker 0: they're quenching that he he's he's from the sort of center right background, but he's more left wing on some issues. Queues. So he's kind of he's a sentry. He's he's\n\nSpeaker 1: And is he seen as a sort of macro figure?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think he's a macro figure. And also, interestingly, he said that he doesn't intend to be prime minister. So he's saying he's leading the party. Vote for the party, and then they're going to decide who'll be prime minister. He's not come out of nowhere in terms of being quite well known in the Netherlands, But his but his party has literally just been formed almost for this election.\n\nSo it's got elements of Macron.\n\nSpeaker 1: What what but but what's what's the platform? Why is he so hugely popular? What's the thing? What are they fed up with? What are they doing?\n\nWhat's the what do voters want him?\n\nSpeaker 0: Because he's basically saying he's sensible in the economy, but look after people kind of thing, and, You know, fairly obvious stuff, but in a\n\nSpeaker 1: You wouldn't thought you can blow up a political system with that kind\n\nSpeaker 0: of message. Bringing it up because one of the problems that has led to this election is the that that small parties can emerge and and do very, very well. And if you look at if you look at the full list, I haven't got it in front of me, but take a look at full list of all the parties that are standing. I mean, there are so many of them, but they will get some votes. And, you know, because it's a portion representation, some of them will end up in in parliament.\n\nBut it's a very, very interesting one. And, you know, maybe because Mark Rutte was there and was seen as quite a strong figure and he held things together, Him going, I think, has possibly just opened up the space for people to look at other people differently. Franz Timmerman as well is doing is doing pretty well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who we may get onto the podcast?\n\nSpeaker 0: I would love to hear on the forecast, and we definitely will. If he becomes prime minister, we'd like to have mister Peter Omsicht. And and and I can I can I can try my 1 sentence of Dutch out on it?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's very good. That's very good. You remind\n\nSpeaker 0: us of\n\nSpeaker 1: your 1 sentence\n\nSpeaker 0: You kept the field. My daughters are built.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. That is impressive.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Do you know what it means? No? I played my bagpipes too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Very good. That evidence is true as well as Peter Omsik.\n\nSpeaker 0: We should keep tabs on that and maybe talk about it again after the event, but Peter Olmsik, definitely worth watching.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is Githin has written to us saying, are Haig and Miliband the most influential politicians in the UK? Are there disastrous changes to leadership elections within their parties, largely to blame for Brexit, Johnson, Corbyn trust, has seen that said clever? Initially, I thought this was a question about whether\n\nSpeaker 0: when they should be brought\n\nSpeaker 1: David Miliband should be brought back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's about Ed Miliband and Willie May.\n\nSpeaker 1: And let me start on that. I absolutely agree with these questions. I think the changes to the leadership elections that allowed Boris Johnson to come through, allowed, Jeremy Corbyn to come through, Allowing this trust to come through were catastrophic. And at least the way the conservative party used to organize There's things before these Hague reforms, which allowed the MPs who actually work day in, day out with these people, knew That Boris Johnson was somebody who could not be trusted and would not have voted for him, I think, if they hadn't sensed that the power of labor, the party, and the party in the country would vote for him was a much better system. And, you can also make a democratic argument for it.\n\nI mean, it's difficult, sometimes to get their head around. But the point is that At least the MPs are elected. Whereas the members of the conservative party in the country, 2 a half 1000000 when my mother was a member in 19 fifties, Now, only just over a 100,000 members, and they get effectively to select the prime minister. So this is totally Much less democratic. Even though it's more people than the MPs, it's much less democratic because unlike the MPs, senator likes it.\n\nSo Yeah. I would like to return to a system where the MPs chose the leader.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, it's it's interesting because this is where sometimes you have to be honest with people about the limitations of of the franchise and democracy and the the systems that you have. I remember Bruce Grocott, who is now in the House of Lords and was Tony's parliamentary private secretary. And I remember at the time of the changes in labor system that he was saying, oh, this this is not this is not sensible. This is not clever.\n\nThe one thing the MPs always have in mind First of all, they know the contenders better, and secondly, they have a a broader interest in making sure they try to get the right person. Whereas members will be a little bit if anything, more divorced from where real public opinion might be. So he was always very, very, very against this. I remember that. And and, of course, it's a hard thing to argue against, what you're saying that the members shouldn't have a say.\n\nWell, no, we're not saying Just an issue that was bigger, say, as the MPs. And, of course, the other problem is that a lot of MPs aren't terribly well respected in their communities. But I I broadly agree with you. I I I think that the that both the main parties should have another look at how they elect their leaders.\n\nSpeaker 1: Lucy Bishop, I'm a politics student at UCL looking at what my next steps are for a life in the political sphere, particularly in foreign policy and diplomacy. Do I need a master's civil service fast stream? Any advice based on the requirements and skills needed before I start my career? So I'd say couple of things on that, and maybe this is just too much my own experience. The first is, I would really recommend, if you wanna work in foreign policy, getting out and spending some time living in a foreign country and ideally in a country in the global south and in a rural area where you're in somewhere very, very different.\n\nBecause one of the biggest challenges in foreign policy Understanding what life is like outside the capital city in a remote rural area in a developing country. So spend a year there. Secondly, I could not recommend the civil service Fast Stream more. It was life changing for me. That 5 years I spent gave me so much of the basic skills of organizing myself, running meetings.\n\nSpeaker 0: How hard is it to get on to?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a competitive exam, but it's a pretty fair meritocratic exam. In the days when I did it, it It was largely an IQ test, basically, a long IQ test. And then the final stage, you were given some exercises on doing some paper and sharing committees. But I for the rest of my life, even, you know, setting up a charity, it was drawing on that 5 years basic experience I had in the civil service just set me up for life.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now listen. This is definitely one for you. Ned Gibbons, why is the far right of the conservative party so powerful? The way I see it, their only way out of the current message is to move towards the center, but many in the party want to head further to the right. What's am I missing?\n\nAnother question, amazing grace, not my daughter, currently appearing in New York, by the way, at the Soho Playhouse, And it's not her, though. Why do the ERG and the right wing of the Tory party hold so much power and sway over their leadership? Are they in the majority? What is it that makes the prime minister's dance to their tune?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's actually not very different from the power that the the left had with Corbyn and the Labour Party. It's partly that, the Tory party members are older and more right wing than the general population. It's partly that Boris Johnson bucked the trend in the 2019 election where he got an over 80 seat majority by tilting to the right when the conventional wisdom is that you should fight in the center. But more than any of that, it's that people who are very ideologically charged, people who spend their time in echo chamber Talking to each other, it doesn't matter whether it's Corbynistas with their own particular socialist version of Britain or whether it's right wing conservatives with their particular I don't know what it is quite. I mean, with Liz Truss, it's a sort of distorted tribute act to Margaret Thatcher.\n\nWith others, it's kinda nationalism. But whatever it is, they Operate in an echo chamber. They talk to their party members. They convince themselves that everybody in the country agrees with them. And in the case of both Corbyn supporters And sort of Boris Johnson, this trust supporters.\n\nOf course, sometimes they're right. There are often things that the center ground politicians aren't concentrating on that the public really care about. Mhmm. So Corbyn was absolutely right to say that the public were very, very angry about the 2008 Financial crisis in the way that the banks got away with things and that no centrist party was really gripping that. And, unfortunately, I think it probably is True that the right of the conservative party has caught on to something when they think that there's a lot of concern amongst the public about immigration.\n\nSo there will be things that they say which resonate with people, which convince them they're right about everything.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: But the major problem is the way that they can hold the balance of power out Out of all proportion to their numbers, so this horrible group from my point of view, at least, during Brexit called the Spartans led by Marc Francois, who eventually were reduced to a rump of barely kind of 30 people, in the end, were able to control the whole party because that was the 30 votes it was\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I saw last night, I was sort of channel hopping a bit last night, and John Craig on Sky News was reporting from outside this meeting of the so called new conservatives who'd been briefing that they were the new power in the land. And he said, sort of count on 2 hands how many MPs were there. I think they overstate their power, and And their power is given. When they say, why did the prime ministers dance to their tunes? It's the fact of the prime ministers dancing to the tunes that gives them their power.\n\nAnd what you've seen post Corbyn with Keir Starmer clearly going in a different direction is that erodes their power. And I think you'll see that now with This is why Soon actually have done this right at the start. I think what he's done with bringing back Cameron is is is going to erode their power. And I suspect before too long, I'll make a prediction that while the other hard right figure, Farage, is making a complete idius of himself in\n\nSpeaker 1: What? 1,200,000 Concannon, Fantastic.\n\nSpeaker 0: 1,500,000. Yeah. I was offered 1,000,000 at one point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And you don't think for 1.5, you might change your mind that I'm a celebrity.\n\nSpeaker 0: I wouldn't. No. I think the tragedy look. If for Farage is not stupid, right, and he's probably yes. He likes money.\n\nOkay? So he's gone there. He's making a lot of money. But I actually do think this is part of his rehabilitation into the Conservative Party. And just like Trump made his political name on reality TV, Raj is thinking the same the same game.\n\nAnd what I keep saying to people, any audience that's willing to listen, if we don't get serious about our apologies again, We are finished. And what this says, if we now reward somebody and the lesson the lesson for the arm of celebrity thing is, I mean, Hancock Matt Hancock did not to help his reputation. I hope Farage doesn't help his reputation because I think what the public should say, you're either a serious political figure or you're not, But you can't go down and do stupid reality TV shows and remain a political serious political figure. But that's his game. So I think the right's power will see itself eroded.\n\nAnd this is how leadership is meant to work. You set a course, and then you try and take people with you. Whereas what Sunak has done since he became prime minister is allow his course to be set by everybody else.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's so difficult, though, isn't it? I I always feel that you are in a tight rope in politics because we push it too far, You can be toppled.\n\nSpeaker 0: For sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and in the end, Theresa May was brought down by by the right she couldn't she she tried to confront them maybe too late. Maybe she didn't do it in the right way, but in the end, They took her down, and they brought in Boris Johnson. But you're absolutely right. Equally, sometimes you face them down in the way that Keir Sama seems to have done with the left of the Labour Party, And it's gone much better for him than many of the Corbynistas would have predicted. Presumably, many of them would have thought, he's never gonna get away with that.\n\nWe're gonna destroy him if he does this. And he did get away with it.\n\nSpeaker 0: And if you if you think about when Jeremy Corbyn was was leave of the Labour Party, okay. So John McDonald is still around, and you see him from time to time. And but there there was a kind of So a dozen MPs who for a time were kind of household names. They were never off the television screen. Well, they're now never on it.\n\nAnd I think that's because there's a different course which is being tracked and people are gathering around that. Now listen, here's one I I really want to to ask because, one, I like the of her asking it in this way, Ginny Smith, from the editorial team of Sussex Bylines, one of 10 regional titles in the Bylines network of online newspapers. How important do you think citizen journalism is becoming in combating the mainstream right wing bias and giving local communities a voice? Very. And I I'm a bit of a fan of the Bylines group.\n\nI think they do. Yes. They are broadly in the same political space as I am, I guess, but I think they, you know, they call out all sides. But I think it's good that we're we're getting these new sort of voices out there. That I put the new European in the same category.\n\nI I think that the, you know, new voices that are not part of this kind of right wing media mix, which I think has done massive damage to the country and to our culture. So, yeah, big fan, Ginny. Carry on. Keep up the good work.\n\nSpeaker 1: Last question for me. Katrina Shepherd, UBI. Last week, Rory outlined how cash given directly transformed homelessness. Perhaps did you discuss your take on how a universal So basic income might work to grow the economy, eradicate poverty, redistribute wealth, and access resources, and might the Labour Party ever consider it? I was thinking we were joking yesterday about Legacy.\n\nAnd I failed to say that if I really was dreaming of a legacy, a legacy I would love to have It's being associated with the generation that ended extreme poverty globally. I mean, it remains unbelievably shocking that there are over 700,000,000 who cannot meet their most basic ends, who are eating once or twice a day, who are dying very young, living in completely unsuitable accommodation, whose kids are not etcetera. So on an international basis, I think the idea of cash transfers to lift people out of poverty is very strong. But I also think in a domestic context, there is more and more evidence that generous, Unconditional cash transfers can really transform the lives of people caught in poverty. And I'm very interested in this because labor can be a bit uneven on this.\n\nOn the one hand, strong socialist tradition of Wanting to tackle inequality and care for the poor. On the other hand, sometimes a temptation to sound pretty kinda macho and aggressive On benefits, cheating, and this kind of stuff. Mhmm. What where do you think Labour's likely to go on this? Can we expect Some fresh radical thinking around addressing poverty in Britain?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think on the universal basic income, Katrina's question, I think I'm right. I could be wrong about this. I'm gonna mention another book now, but Ed Miliband's book, Go Big. I can't remember whether this I think this was one of the sort of proposals that he was at least saying, let's look at this. And he was giving some sort of analysis as to why this might be a good thing.\n\nI can't see Labour going for it in this next manifesto. But I think it's one of those things that's that's on the agenda. Interestingly, I think Elon Musk was talking about this as well because of law.\n\nSpeaker 1: A lot of the Silicon Valley people like it because they think that AI is gonna lead to mass unemployment Yeah. And a lot of redistribution of wealth towards the Elon Musk's world, at which point taxing them And giving a universal basic income to people would be the only solution if you ended up with Matt Sutton Punzmann.\n\nSpeaker 0: Where I am, and I I sort of blow hot and cold on this, on the one hand, I can see the the logic, and the and I can see the political attraction as well. On the other hand, I can see a lot of the difficulties. Do you know what? I think we should do a special on this at some point.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think we should get a couple of people in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. To do UBI?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think I think I think it's a really,\n\nSpeaker 1: really Maybe some of these big ideas. Maybe I think that's a great idea. Or maybe we Could get someone on the UBI and Yashimank at the same time or something like that where we could get, I ideas radical ideas on on direction of modern democracies.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Good. Excellent. Well, on that commitment to yet another workload, for the rest is politics. I remember, well, I don't know what I said when I first went to you, Robyn.\n\nI know when I was first approached by this. It won't be more than a few hours a week. It'll just be able to fit around everything else.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. It's it's getting it's getting a lot. I I've Very kindly, occasionally, I get approached by, headhunters trying to convince me to be chairs of boards. And they always say to me Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Couple of hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Couple of hours.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then he talks to the previous board chair, and he's like, you couldn't do it. I took it all the way. 8 days a month, and you're\n\nSpeaker 0: like, oh. Anyway, not that we don't enjoy it, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Not that we don't enjoy it. We love it. Thank you all for your wonderful questions.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best.\n\nSpeaker 1: See you all next week. Bye bye.",
