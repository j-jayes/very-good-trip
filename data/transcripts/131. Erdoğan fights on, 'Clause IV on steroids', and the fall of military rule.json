Welcome to another episode of The Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell. And with me, Rory Stewart, we're sitting we're sitting in a a very strange barstool on a round table looking at each other in Harrogate. Through 2 very large microphones. Through 2 very large microphones. You're fortunately tall enough for me to be able to see you at the top. You can't see me. Can't see you very well, ma'am. And we're we're going to, Later today, doing a live show in Harrogate. Very exciting. This, of course, is a place which was the the home of the Gilbert and Sullivan That's very good. I might do that. Now there's a lot to get through. We had a, I think, quite a significant speech by Keir Starmer over the weekend. We've had these, Frankly, bizarre conferences by groups, factions associated with the Conservative Party. We'll talk about the Turkish elections. I actually found the elections in Thailand more interesting. I've seen there's the no coverage in the UK media of it. We should talk about that as well. Very good. But let's start with Keir Starmer. I I don't know if you had time to read his speech, but he actually talked about how he felt the conservative party is no longer conservative. Well, I I liked all all that stuff. I couldn't agree more with him on that. I thought that was very strong. So center of his speech, he says, as you said, that they've given up on family. They've given up on their international reputation. And he said, if people call me a conservative, I'm not gonna be ashamed if being a conservative means those kind of things. So It was a nice push at that part of the speech towards the kind of conservatism I care about. However, what do you think about the speech as a whole? I thought it It did a lot of things that I want him to do. It set out it was much more rounded about the kind of state of the world and the state of politics than he's been up to now. It's still, I think deliberately short on the the big ticket policy stuff. But I think this line that he used about, you're gonna get clause 4 on steroids. Clause 4, the big thing that Tony Blair did in 1994, changing the labor party constitution. I think what he's doing there is setting up the next stages, And he's gonna have to be held to that now. I think once you start to say things like that, you've got to come up with a quality idea. Tricky thing, isn't it? Just tell us where was it? Who was he speaking to? What was this? So it's a conference organized by, relatively new group called Progressive Britain, but who are on the progressive side of the Labour Party probably do want to push more on the on the big bold radical side of things rather than the Ming bars. But I I thought it was one of I really do think it was one of his better speeches, and I I quite like that out boldness of of saying we're coming on we're bringing tanks onto your lawn. And I do you know the other thing I think? This thing about the conservatives, If I think about you being a conservative, I think your conservatism is very much rooted in history, culture, tradition, not changing things unless you really need to. And they come along, they want to change the the sort of rate the health service, change the BBC, pollute our seas and rivers with Unimaginable quantities of human wastage. And it's not very conservative. And I thought that was a that was a smart place to be, But then the next bit of his kind of journey of leadership, I think, is going to be about taking 3 or 4 big areas where the big policy ideas come. And that's what we have to See. Because as you say, if you're gonna talk about clause 4 on steroids I mean, clause 4 was huge, probably the biggest thing that Labour Party had done. So Clause 4 on steroids, I didn't quite understand what that can be that's gonna be bigger than clause 4. 12. But I think clause clause 4. I mean, I think this is another problem, isn't it? For all these politicians that they have in their minds these radical moves. So the conservatives, obviously, completely obsessed with Margaret Thatcher. And one of their problems is that they keep working out how they can outdo Margaret Thatcher. But, of course, the things she's done can't be done twice. Prioritization, selling off council houses, restructuring the economy, and they're gonna be able to do them again. He's not gonna be able to get rid of clause 4 twice. What's what's the big reform that he's gonna bring to the Labour Party according to clause 4? What he's talking about, the reform of public services. But clause 4 was Was a reckoning with the party? Right? Yes. It was. But that's what you know, we've talked a lot about how leadership is about telling the party things it doesn't want to hear. People go on about clause clause 4, I think, much more because of the the symbolism the symbolism of that change. It wasn't it didn't really Remind us what Claws for what? What did it say? Oh, god. The ownership common ownership and means of just distribution supply. I remember production distribution supply. It was a sort of faintly Marxist It's a sounding course. And it was something which the Labour Party no longer believed. Even Dennis Skinner didn't really believe in that as a kind of, you know, economic policy. So it was symbolic, And then the policy change followed from that. And I think with these missions I did an event last night with Beth Wriggley from Sky, over the How To Academy. And so about 5 or 600 people there, Obviously, coming out on a Tuesday night to listen to me and Beth Rigby talk about a book about politics, they're interested in politics. Somebody asked a question about the missions, the 5 labor missions. And I and I asked for a show of hands in the audience, who has heard of the 5 labor missions? It was a minority. So my point on that is that they've still got to communicate the basic big picture of the time together as well. There is a messaging problem. I'm not sure He's quite tightened his language enough. So there were 3 big words that he was selling the speech. Do you remember what those words were? I I mean, I I can tell you what Respect. Yep. I I don't wanna put you on the spot, but it's service, respect, and stability. But even when you said Service, respect. But I mean, obviously, I love that stuff. Sounds very conservative. I love service, respect, stability. But it doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it? Service, respect, stability. There's a lot of hesitancy going on. Yeah. It's kind of him, though. I think this this this respect thing, I know, goes very deep with him. Sibilance. Service response. Okay. Okay. Well, that's that's a that's a biolinguistic point, I suppose, the major political strategic point. This respect thing is massive for him, I think. Are action words. That's another thing, maybe. As a communications expert, if I came to you and said my 3 big words, and I run a campaign on service, respect, and stability, It doesn't it's not a call to action, exactly, I said. But Gordon listen. Gordon ran on stability and did very, very well, but as a chancellor rather than as the leader of the party. You, would want To say stability, and this is what Gordon Brown did, if you are the government. Because as George Osborne was saying in our just to plug it, our leading interview, which Which is out this week. Just just go to your podcast feed, search for leading Leading George Osborne. George Osborne. Yeah. In that, he pointed out that, basically, you've got 2 strategies. Either you're in opposition, which case you say things gotta change Mhmm. Or you're in government, in which case you have to say stability, basically. You have to say it was Gordon Gordon and society in opposition. You had a good phrase for it there, didn't you? You said, lot done. Lots done. Yep. Lots to do. Lots to lose. Very good. And and by the way, my friend Eddie Rama in Albania has just had the best election local election results ever. That's it. 55 municipalities to 6. On the lots done, lots to do, lots to lose. I obviously, Keir Starmer's not Gonna be particularly listening to me, but I think I do represent a certain kind of floating voter. And when I saw that speech, I felt there was still Not enough optimism, vision, and hope. There was quite a lot of I mean, he did quite a lot on How dare they bail out the bankers and make poor people pay to bail out banks? Now as far as I know, Labour Party policy at the time was to provide state support for those banks. He's not laying out what the alternative is That's a grudge from 2008, 9? Mhmm. Who's he playing to there? Where's the where's where's the where's the constituency for that stuff? I I think that's the sort of, a a a labor a a sort of strong tribal labor base that really wants to hear the Tories getting the boot put in put into them. And did Tony Blair do that? Did you feel you had to do that in 95, 96? Oh, yeah. I mean, Tony didn't like doing the, sort of, nasty negative stuff, but he could do it. I remember when he once remember when he did John Major over the dispatch box, week, week, week. And you could feel the blow loudly with each word. I remember he came out and said, I didn't like doing that. I said, yeah, but you did it. And I guess he did it on the He would have done it on the banning out of the European exchange rate. Like, there's more of that sort of stuff. Yeah. And I think I think a little bit of Ion has entered Keir's soul post Sunak. I think he's been quite taken aback by how Quite nasty soon that can be. All this lefty lawyer stuff and and constant misrepresentation. He did it again the other day about the police numbers and the crime figures. And so I think I I don't know. I feel Keir's moved into a different gear, but but I still I agree with where I agree with you, I still want more in that page that says, this is what Britain's gonna be like if you have 10 years of a local government. Oh, we like I think there's a lovely phrase, that John McCain loved, which is that People like voting for a politician who's a happy warrior. They like the sense of the confident, happy optimism. Well, that was Johnson's strength. That was Johnson's strength, unfortunately. Yeah. But it would be nice to see a little bit of that here. Now should we talk about the Tories? Yeah. You're a lot. I mean, horrifying. Fine. So I'm looking at the list. So this is this is something that you've you've raised with us and called the National Conservatism Conference London, May 15th to 17th. Led and the confirmed speakers, Suella Braverman, Douglas Murray, Jacob Rees Mogg, Senator JD Vance from the US, Lee Anderson, Theodore Dalrymple, who writes these articles in The Spectator grumbling about generally grumbling about people on benefits As far as I can remember, David Frost, John Hayes, Melanie Phillips, Nigel Bigger, who's the theologian at Oxford, who's been doing revisionist history On the British Empire, Darren Grimes? It's a pretty pretty astonishing group of people, isn't it? Terrific. Terrific. Also, I mean, Sumely Bravaman, she's the home secretary in a government led by Rishi Sunak, who yesterday was meeting Zelensky, The leader of Ukraine to talk about the next stage is in an incredibly important military confrontation with Russia. And his home secretary is topping the bill at an organization an an event organized essentially to tell Rishi Sunak that his domestic political strategy is autocock. And some of the speeches, Douglas Murray, who you mentioned, said he was talking about the, you know, there's nothing wrong with it. She had this thing about there's nothing racist about wanting to stop immigrants coming into the country. I always have a problem with people who start There's nothing racist to that. It usually means they're going to go on to exploit racism if they can. She he Douglas Murray made this speech where he said that just because the Germans mucked picked up a couple of times in the last century, which doesn't mean we should stop feeling proud about our nationality. I mean, that is a pretty amazing historical analogy. Jacob Rees Mogg, who sat in the cabinet when the voter ID registration bill was being put through, attacked Sunak for doing it and said it was gerrymandering. And Braverman, this this lot, honestly, if this was at the equip the left wing equivalent, the right wing papers would be going insane with this stuff. Braverman made this joke about Keir Starmer, who doesn't know the difference between a man and a woman, maybe he'll be end up being the 1st woman leader of the Labour Party. I mean, they're they're just it's pathetic stuff. And then then Danny Kruger had a big speech on the centrality of family and how Stick together when you hate each other Yeah. For the kids. It's it's it's pretty odd because it feels I mean, including the inclusion of a US Republican senators are in this. And also funded by an American think tank. It's all this sort of, you know, where's the money coming from stuff, which never gets asked of the right. But very much, this is People leaning into American cultural issues. And, of course, Lee Anderson, very central to all of that, who's who's the the vice chairman of the party. Well, he's the guy who said on Deputy chairman of the party. Out loud, you know, The the last election, we had Boris, Brexit, and Corbyn. We've got none of those at the next. We've gotta have culture wars and trans. But this is why I was talking to a conservative cabinet minister yesterday who was saying that it seems likely, of course, that the conservatives will lose the next election. Is that what they think now? It's not not exactly that's what they think. That's not a big revelation 21. But what was striking is how completely confident he was that when they lose, the leading candidates will be from the right, And the party will lurch the right in response to loss, and that and Kemi Badnock are the leaders to take over the party. Which you know what? If Labour do get in, Even with a small majority, it could be good for Labour. I think if the Tory party lurches into some sort of post Farageist Yukipari of culture war nonsense. I think it's very, very bad for the country. Well, I agree with that. I agree with that. I agree it's bad for the country. So I did that policies live program, and Danny Kruger was on the panel, and so was Shammy Chakrabarty. And Shammy and I Didn't always agree about stuff during the pandemic. Danny Danny Kruger was a big supporter of Boris Johnson. He was one of his private secretaries before he was elected. He was one of the key members of his administration. I wonder how he reconciles his very strong Christian views on marriage with being a strong supporter of Boris Johnson. Who knows? But what was really fascinating was we Shammy and I, at one point, were looking at each other because Danny Kruger was coming out with this stuff about he was looking at us and pointing at us and saying that This leftist, so I think he says something like morally transformative agendas. I'm wondering what the hell is he talking about? And then he comes up with his speech about, you know, couples should stay together for the kids, and I just thought the the whole thing felt weird. I'll tell you the other thing that really made me laugh. You know the other organizer? We've talked about the the Napped Cons as they call themselves. But the day before, you had the other one, the the the Bannerman, Cruddus, Lord Cruddus, Boris Johnson fan and club, what's he called? Organization of Democratic, something like that. And somebody sent me The clips of Priti Patel, Nadine Dorries, Andrea Jenkins, and Cruddas speaking. You know that thing they have in the corner of the screen which tells you how many people are watching online live. The highest was 66. And you were one of them? Well, I wasn't one of them. Somebody said to me, I record 25 of them were Tory MPs who've now got shows on GB News where they talked about this amazing conference that they were all at. But we do give them we're probably doing the same now. We're giving them far too much attention. But on Pravamen, what so when Rees Mogg came out and said to that conference yesterday, he said, We will be toast. We'll be finished if we try and change the leader again. I wonder if, actually, he was trying to signal in a very misleading way to Sunak that his position is tape when actually it's not safe at all. Well and and, of course, one of the extraordinary things is that Tory MPs always say that and then often go on and change leaders. I mean, it's it's a knee jerk reaction. They said it will be tested if we get rid of Boris Johnson. Will be tested if we get rid of Liz Truss. I think Rishi Sunak did something which was Brave and correct, which was to get rid of this bill, which was going to rip up EU legislation. But it's a very, very risky, dangerous thing he did within his party because He got elected on a manifesto. You remember he had a Video of a shredder? A video of a shredder. And that has really wound up the Brexit right who feel profoundly Trade. And, actually, in this, extremely bad tempered exchange you had on news night, you had, you had a was it on news night? Was this Bad tempered exchange. Anyway, with that lady on it was news side. Right? Yeah. It was news side. In that, I noticed she was also laying into Rishi Sunak And questioning whether he was really a Brexiteer and saying, you know, that he had betrayed his promises. He didn't really believe in the whole project. So He's got a very, very difficult job trying to hold that transaction together. We should probably talk a little bit about the news and I think, but did that not, Damaged Badnock as well, because she's the one who had to present the the whole thing to the commons as being pinned. Yeah. I think it must be difficult for her. So that helps Braverman? Probably does. Yeah. Probably does. Although it might make Cali Bad not paradoxically, there are still probably a 100 Tory MPs who see them more sells more on the center left of the party. So do you think I strayed from the disagreeing agreeably path of enlightenment in the Roy Stewart here at My Life. Well, I don't know. I occasionally do it myself. What I notice being a a a sinner myself, is Is that is that certainly Shoshana watching it doesn't like seeing either of us getting shouty? She didn't I mean, when she was watching with me, she didn't particularly blame you for But she thought the whole tone of the thing as a as a watcher. You cease to take in the the arguments, and you begin to face it. I'm I'm just very glad that Fiona was in bed and didn't here. And when she saw I was trending in Twitter on Twitter the next morning, she said, what have you done? I said, I just on Newsnight last night, it was a bit of a bit of a problem and, got a bit aerated. She didn't watch it. So explain tell us a bit about it for people who didn't watch it. So I put out a speech as I was doing that night about Europe, which I wanted to be about my desire that Labour become a bit bolder on calling out the Brexit disaster. And because the soon I could announce that they were scrapping the the retained EU law bill. They asked me if I would go on. I thought I was going to be on go on with a Jacob Riessmaul Gora, a Farage, or something like that. Maybe I don't follow these things as close as I should, but I I'd actually I didn't even know who she was. I couldn't quite believe And she was an MEP She's a former MEP. She's now an adviser to Richard TICE, the Reform Party. But, UKIP and EPO? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or the Brexit party. Brexit party. And Before this before we went in there, the Israeli the an Israeli MP was about to go on after us with the Palestinian ambassador. I was talking to the Palestinian ambassador about Middle East peace process, and such like. And she she got into conversation and started to try to tell the Palestinian ambassador that people in working class areas in and their cost of living was rising because of Brexit. To which he looked and said, do you know anything about inflation and how the economy works on inflation? So that I just thought This is not going So so it wasn't going well in the green room? It wasn't going badly, but it wasn't going great. And then in the interview, she just came out with stuff that was it's just Utter bilge and factually inaccurate and, you just get sick of it after a while. What I didn't like myself for doing was turning on Victoria Derbyshire. I think I probably did that because And Victoria Burch, the BBC interviewer. Yeah. Who actually I I do think there's been a problem with the BBC according out these Brexiters. I mean, you know, the fact that Nigel Farage has been under question time more than any other politician in history is ridiculous. They very rarely get pinned to the wall. Well, even last night new for Arsenal Newsnight last night saying Brexit is a disaster. He's now just commenting on it despite having been one of the great creators of it. So I got very aerated with with Victoria. But to be honest, it's one of those things, end of a long day. And do you find the process of publishing your book And the reviews and the interviews and all this stuff. Is it stressful? Because sometimes what's happening is people are kinda dredging up your past, Chucking the Iraq war at you, chucking your time in Downing Street at you. Is that unpleasant for you? Do you have quite a thick skin? Do you worry about it? I don't no. I I don't. I quite enjoy look, I there will come a point, probably in a couple of weeks, where I'll think, well, I've done the book and I'll move on to the next thing. So now on the way here, I went to a school, just down the road, and I really enjoyed it. Young kids, really engaged in politics, All of them getting a book for the asking a question, all that sort of stuff. And it was so that sort of stuff I enjoy. I should I don't know if you're aware, Rory, but I did Invent another new word yesterday, podoltery. Podoltery? Podoltery. I committed podoltery yesterday. Oh, yes. I was invited on that So I'm supposed to be asking a surprise question to you on that show. You went on newsagents. I did. Yeah. So you have to do certain things. As you will find out when Politics On the Edge is published in September. You have to do all sorts of of pedultory. So I did a bit of pedultory. And What I what was interesting, you mentioned Iraq, they actually taught a lot about these changes that we had around. They were singing your praises as an interviewer, And they were saying they thought that you got more out of me on Iraq than anybody else ever had. That's very kind. I don't agree with that, but, you know, that's what they thought. Listen. Just just a You know, I don't find it that difficult. I just I know when I'll have reached the end of But but but it's not been too painful. No. I was in Paris yesterday, and I was in a square outside the Senate, where for 5 months, Catholic protesters were protesting a change on surrogate mothers. And I was reminded how very different the culture wars are in places like France from the culture wars here. In France and the United States, So much of it is driven by religion. And whatever's happening in the National Conservatism Conference, the culture wars of Lee Anderson and Stoking up here. It feels to me as though Britain is still a much, much more secular society. And so despite the fact you get, You know, JD Vance, who's a US senator, wanted to talk about keeping the family together and all that stuff. It's got a completely different resonance in the US, or even, I think, in Catholic countries in Europe To the rest of the What's the issue in France? So that was I I'm just reminded of it again. Again, I keep forgetting that one of the things that It's a continual challenge. It's that there is still a conservative religious Catholic element in in in French politics that doesn't like Liberal progressive reforms brought in by Francois, your friend Francois, on on things like surrogate mothers. And I was just reminded that for 5 months, It's sat on the square outside the senate protesting it. And the What about the assisted dying thing? Is that not seen as a religious thing? Because Macron's moving the dial on that pretty fast. Well, I think I think it's a huge thing. And I think we underestimate how much in all these countries, when you and I naturally applaud progress in Ireland France on all these issues, how there is often 40% of the population that remains very, very uncomfortable about these things. I'm probably very resentful of the politicians that introduced them. Right. On that note, we'll take a break. Welcome back to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And Alastair looking Extremely sort of fresh, notwithstanding the middle of his book tour. Looking fresh? Yeah. I think it looked pretty fresh. Okay. I did swim this morning. Doing well? You went for another one of your cold swims? I did. Very Pretty good. It's not recall at the moment. 16 degrees. Was that in London or here in Yorkshire, where we recorded Lido. It's not I might find somewhere in West Yorkshire tomorrow. Now what's the population of Turkey? Population of Turkey? I don't know what's the population. 85,200,000. Very good. Thailand, 71.6. Which is roughly the same as United Kingdom. Yep. And how much have you heard on the British media about the elections in Thailand? Very little. Are Are you gonna tell us about them? Well, I think they're fascinating because the party that's been running the place, which is very pro military And pro king. And Very Pro King, have been absolutely battered. A party that's clearly taken a lot of lessons from Emmanuel Macron calling itself the Move Forward Party. You could always say, em barge. Progressive, youth led. Actually, At the heart of their campaign, something that could be seen as a crime because they're actually calling for reform of the monarchy, And they have the whole Les Majesticet thing that you're not allowed to it's 15 years top sentence for criticizing the the monarchy. Or indeed their pets. Probably their pets. Exactly. Or anything they wear. Yeah. They have campaigned on reducing the power of the military, ending conscription, new constitution, and they've done incredibly well. One one way I saw it described is that what made them different From the party that came second, which is the traditional populist party, is, as you say, their focus is on institutional reform. People didn't really think they we're gonna get anywhere. Institutional reform's not usually a sexy subject. People argued that the reform to the constitution, the election rules made it very difficult for this party to come through. And despite New types of electoral system, which is a parallel system that first past the post, that PR, they've managed to come romping through over 30% of the vote. And then the parties with which the Former prime minister Priyat Chanocha is associated. Between them, he's got 2 parties, one that used to run and one that now does 76 between us. So they're finished. But what's terrible about this whole system is that the prime minister now has to be chosen by a by 250 members of the senate who have been appointed by the military. So even though these guys have won, it's not clear how they're gonna put together a coalition. But it is an absolute we're going about populism, and we'll as we talk about Erdogan. This is a total defeat of the populists. Well, it's it's it's it's extraordinary. It's a defeat for the populists, and it's a defeat for the crusty military Conservatives who are sort of 2 different bits of Thailand for a new progressive movement that's very exciting and took credible numbers of seats in Bangkok, Took a lot of seats in Chiang Mai, which is the 2nd largest city led by this charismatic Mhmm. A graduate from actually the Harvard Kennedy School where I used to teach a bit. He Was there when I was there? I didn't think he took my classes. This is Peter Limjaroie Nat. And then the other guy, the the one of the candidates who who led The youth movement and the the protests against the government in 2020 is still in his twenties and he won of won one of these seats in in Bangkok. And I think they owned I think they won all but one of the constituents in Bangkok. So it's a pretty big story, but, and then you've you've now got this, whether they'll be able to form a government on the basis that they can they're going to deliver on some of these promises of reforming the military and reforming the The monarchy will wait and see. So so, like, little little potted history of, Thailand. So the Thailand was ruled for More than 70 years by the current king's father, who ruled at the kind of length that queen Elizabeth the second or the emperor Hirohito ruled, all the way from just after the 2nd World War through the 2000. Was very much caught up in US cold war politics because you remember the domino theory, and the whole idea was that if Vietnam fell, Thailand was gonna be the next to fall. So the US really invested in the fifties sixties and trying to back generally quite right wing anti communist governments in Thailand. In 92, it had its breakthrough into democracy, which the old king was incredibly important 4, a bit like, I think, the king of Spain coming in after Franco. There was a very famous image where the general and the main opposition leader knelt in front of the king, and the king basically told them to get on with the elections. And this vision of these 2 people kneeling in front of him was incredibly important. And it was, of course, one of the real economic miracles. This is a country which, in 1980, had a GDP per capita about $1500, And it's now up at $10,000 per capita in in in not even in purchasing power parity terms in In absolute dollar terms, was hit very hard by this financial crisis in 97, bounced back by about 2004, 5. And even with all these changes, because there were these horrible military coups, which have happened now twice in the since 2000, At a time when you felt the world was ever more democratizing, Thailand was the exception to the rule, military coup's happening, but still hasn't off the course of very, very impressive economic rate, slightly reduced by the military, but still one of the great miracles to Stream poverty rate in Thailand are now something like 0.03% of people. Do you give directly work there? Living under $2? No. We don't because it's much too wealthy. Now given that we want to be prosecuted under the Thai laissez majestay rules, let me just tell people a little bit about the king of Thailand, which nobody's allowed to talk about. We don't want to be prosecuted. We don't want to be prosecuted. We like the fact that we can criticize our own king, though very, very few people do, especially you. Have you ever criticized our king? No. No. I I know. And is that a point of principle? Well, I do really admire him. I I do think he's wonderful. King Vajiralonkom, who's the current king, do you know where he lives? No. Munich lives in Bavaria. Frame. Why? Why? Well, it's it's actually a sort of family tradition. His his father, largely, until he became king, lived in Switzerland. But it appears that, he has a a lady love, and he has been spending most of his time living in Bavaria. And this is one of the Large objections of the Thai people that they're keen Do they all know that? Yes. Everyone knows that. How do they know that if you can't criticize them? Well, it's it's difficult to get the news out, but occasionally it Comes out. I mean, something comes up for things like WikiLeaks. So the US ambassador wrote this wonderful report about air chief marshal Foo Foo, who was the poodle belonging to the king who turned up at a diplomatic reception dressed in a full evening gear, Including Diamante little, shoes that covered, I guess, his paws and was allowed to dance over the tables drinking from the US ambassador's drink. Also in WikiLeaks, was a famous video of Phu Fu's birthday hosted by the king And the queen who appeared topless for the for the birthday party. So anyway, the king's reputation as a party boy, he's now 70 years old. Yeah. Living in Munich. Living in Munich, and the relationships with Foo Foo, and what's called his profound moments of eccentricity Compared to the very, very revered status of his father, who for 70 years was seen as an extraordinary sort of force for for good and religious Just propriety in Thailand is is at the heart of But does King not have to do stuff in Thailand? Does he keep him to flip back to Thailand to do ceremonial stuff? No. He he he doesn't do very much No. And in fact, there was a tradition in the Tyrell House of not doing very much that. Quite a lot of them in the twenties thirties were ruling from Europe. Turkey? Turkey. Erdogan's gonna win. Erdogan's gonna win because he so it's gone to a runoff Mhmm. May 26th, I think. 28th. May 20th, very good, but he almost got it 49% of the votes. So it's gonna be very, very difficult for him not to make it through. Also the guy who's taken the 5%, the 3rd guy, he's even further to the right than the Erdogan. So it's very hard to see that 5% going back to the opposition. Absolutely. And the opposition leader, to add to his problems, had Support from the Kurdish party, and Erdogan's whipping up the fact he had support from the Kurdish party to turn up and considerate. I mean, there's a Small hope that now people see Erdogan as vulnerable. Mhmm. They may change their minds in the election. So I wouldn't completely He writes it off, but it looks like he's gonna be able to win. The thing is it that's interesting. We talked a bit about the I mean, I think we have been consistent about saying that we think that Erdogan probably would end up winning, But he actually did incredibly well in the earthquake zones where there'd been an assumption that they'd handle it so badly. I I you remember, we did a podcast when I was in the earthquake scenes. And I was actually quite struck by how much the Turkish state had mobilized. He'd moved governors who are like French prefaces. They sort of appointed people down. And I was in a room with 1 of these Turkish governors running the response near Gaziantep, and it was pretty impressive. If he had all the military and the police, and they lined up, they had the maps out. They were and trucks were pouring in. So I I can see that working. In a sense, that's what he made his reputation. He made his reputation. Erdogan made his reputation in Istanbul in the nineties As a guy who got things done, he was and even when he was president, it was all about the fact he doubled the number of roads in the country. He massively increased water supply, bridges. He loves big public infrastructure. He also did a huge Public sector pay deal just before the election. I mean, like, huge for and big raising the minimum wage, big civil service pay rises. And I guess the other thing I mean, Jonathan Powell's brother, Chris, who's quite involved in politics in different parts the world. And he he was involved with the the Istanbul mayor, Imamoglu, who we've talked about before, who I think would have been a much better for opposition leader. Then Of course, they have managed to get him stuck away in jail for a bit because he criticized the election authorities which are entirely appointed by Erdogan. And And, also, it was strange watching I watched the, I actually took a leaf out of your book, and I watched it, the live coverage on Al Jazeera, which was pretty good to be honest. They are with Sean Robertson and and the CNN. But what was when you saw the numbers all being announced by the official Turkish news agency, which is pretty much controlled by Erdogan, And it was clearly designed to try to make the opposition people who were watching the the the the vote counting just give up. And and so they held in, and they're going to they they're they're still there. They're still in the fight, but I find it very, very hard. Unless because the turnout was so high, it was something about 88 point 2%. Unbelievable. 82%. And so it's very hard to see where those people who might think, oh my god. Yeah. Maybe we could beat him, given that the polls were saying that was going to happen anyway. So he's sort of So those turn up figures are unbelievable, aren't they? I mean, I don't think anyone gets this kind of turn up figures. No. See, well, other than you unless you have compulsory voting. The other thing I looked into, The Turk a lot of Turks, obviously, living around the European Union. The vote for Erdogan in the 1,500,000 Turks living in Germany, 65.4%. So very, very struck by how much German politicians are interacting with this, partly because I mean, as you say, you had a figure of just over a1000000. But in fact, 3,000,000 Germans, I think, were born in Turkey, and 7,000,000 have Turkish ancestry. Yeah. And and and because the Germans have been quite tight on giving them German passports. A lot of them will still be Turkish citizens, even more than and it was even higher in the Netherlands. 68% of the Netherlands, 64% of France and 71% of Turks living in Austria Voting for Erdogan. Voting for Erdogan. And a lot of them I I read a thing in Bild Zeitung where they were saying that the reason is because they really resent the way that European politicians talk about Turkey and talk about Erdogan. I was thinking about his career. I was also thinking about the the similarities both of them went to, quite conservative Islamist backgrounds. Erdogan grew up As a teenager, literally on the street selling water bottles, selling Simit, which is like a big pretzel, then didn't probably go to university. He claims he did, but There's no real record of that. Was a footballer, so you'd relate to that. And, anyway, old group was also actually a semifredion footballer with Gold Coast. He's got a very he's the other one's got a very Kind of let it go. Well, he's he never smiles, does he? It's very strange as a politician. But then he became I remember from the nineties through to about 2014 was such a kind of hopeful figure. When when he came in in the early 2000, he very, very quickly did these amazing reforms. He He said very progressive things about gay rights. He got rid of the death penalty. He tried to run a peace process with the Kurds. Yeah. But a lot of this was about EU accession. And when that began going sour In about 2014 and we talk about 2014 as the beginning of the age of populism in a sense because that's when Modi comes in in India. That's when ISIS take Mosul. And that's the point at which Things change with with Erdogan. That's the point at which he becomes president. Essentially, we say that because I hadn't really thought about it because I've forgotten it. But when We've talked before about the 1st time with Tony that we met Putin. Similar with Erdogan, he was seen as a a kind of reformist, west leaning, On pro Atlanticist. And this campaign I mean, Biden has been a big part of this campaign. Essentially, he's been saying, You know, vote for me to put Biden in his place. It's it's a almost a complete reversal of where he was. Obama's 1st international trip and first big Speech was made in Turkey in 2009 because Turkey was seen as this fantastic example of moderate Islamists, Western friendly NATO members trying to join the European Union and a model for what Syria could be, Iraq Could be all these other countries could be without an invasion, without an intervention, a sort of positive, locally led move. And then suddenly from 2014 onwards, It all begins to go pretty horribly wrong. There's this coup, which there's still lots of questions about. Was it a real coup against him? Was it a coup he himself staged? He then drove this crackdown, which ended up with 91,000 people being arrested. Mhmm. A whole areas of self-service cleaned out. Then he brought through a new constitution that he got through on a 52/48 referendum. You can remember that kind of stuff, which basically strengthened the power of the presidency against judicial. He built a $300,000,000 presidential palace. Started flirting with the Russians. Bought their air defense systems. Started getting very, very aggressively involved in Somalia, in Libya, and this kind of Ottoman expansion muscle Stuff. And then went full on eccentric on his economic policy in 2018. It's still there? Yeah. Where he wiped out half the value of his currency in a year, drove incredible numbers of companies to bankruptcy with an absolute and we we talk about It's the opposite of austerity. He was a great believer in borrow, borrow, borrow, and putting the interest rates as low as possible. We still do. With inflation, well, it's coming down a little bit now. Way, way, way beyond what most countries do. I mean, you've taken us neatly into that that part another thing happening in in that part of the world that you've been talking about, which is Syria, back in the Arab League. Is is this another string to the bow of David Miliband talking about the age of impunity? Well, it's extraordinary, isn't it? So that is An announcement has just come out, and it's been led by Saudi Arabia and UAE and opposed by Jordan And Qatar. Yeah. It's absolutely astonishing. I mean, heartbreaking for the Syrian opposition because they famously gave speeches in the Arab League 10 years ago. They were given the the Syrian seat, weren't they? Absolutely. And so the yeah. And and now find themselves absolutely out on the cold. Meanwhile, the Syrian economy, we we've been talking a lot about Thailand, Turkey, Syria. I just had some figures that I that I was looking at about how these different countries have fared since 1980. So Thailand, GDP per capita, $700 in 1980, $8,000 today, 11 times richer. Turkey, $2,000, 1980, $10,000 today, 5 times richer. Very, very, you know, impressive stuff. South Korea, 15 times growth. But Syria, Syria has gone from a situation in which they were at $2,000 in 1980, Reached $10,000 in 2007 and are now down at $1,200 per capita. They have Basically pushed 30% of their population to extreme poverty, 70% now unemployed. And they've gone from being, an upper middle income country to being one of the poorest countries in the world. 200,000 of them are dead in the Current situation. The other thing I didn't realize was the extent to which one of the reasons why the Saudis are so keen to get this thing sorted is because they Mohammed bin Salman, as he goes towards his vision in 2030, doesn't want his neighbors kind of, you know, with all this trouble going on. But I hadn't realized that this drug, Captagon and amphetamine, is now Syria's largest export. It's effectively become a mafia state. And and members of of his family, Assad's family, are sanctioned because of their trade in this. Yeah. And this drug And and the British, have put out a paper saying that 80% of the world trade in Captagon. So Captagon is, As you said, it's amphetamine related to Phenylephrine, which some of us get in our cold medication. Obviously, this is You were the you were the drugs expert on this podcast taking opium. Yeah. Absolutely. What does this one do to you, this captain? Well, so originally developed in the 19 sixties to deal with attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy. And then by the early seventies, people began cutting down on its use because of its psychotic effects. And by the middle of the eighties, almost nobody was producing it anymore. And then a Bulgarian gang began shipping it through with Balkan traders into the Middle East, developed a huge market for it in places like UAE and Saudi. They then moved their production facilities. The Bulgarians, the Turks cracked down on this, in the early 2000. Production facilities started again in Syria. And according to the British, The Syrian regime and Assad is currently making 3 times the volume of trade of the Mexican drug cartels, this thing called Captagon. It's incredible, but, I mean, virtually, everything in the world knows about the Mexican drug cartels, but I didn't even know about this until recently. Is it Sorry. And and the Saudis just found, I think, 4,600,000 pills hidden in flour. The UAE has just found pills hidden in green bean shipments, And it's all coming through from Syria. The so the the Jordanians, there's a new committee being set up with the Saudis, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, who are looking at all these issues, amnesties, return of refugees, drug smuggling and how to rein in Russian and Iranian influence. That's quite a big agenda. And and it seems to me they'll achieve none of those things. I think another thing that is difficult here. Is it's another sign of the way in which the Saudi US relationship is breaking apart? Because the US has been very, very clear that they do not like the idea of normalizing relationships with Bashar al Assad. And there's a pattern now of Saudi Deliberately poking the United States in the eye, partly because they feel humiliated. Partly Biden, called them a prior state. Trump refused to Support Saudi when there were these attacks from Houthi again the Houthi Iranian backed terrorists against, oil terminals. But since Mohammed bin Salman's come in, There's been a lot of this stuff. Do you remember when the US made requests on their oil production because of sanctions against Ukraine, Russia? They completely ignored it And basically help the Russians with their move on. We talked about the theatricality of Biden's visit to Northern Ireland and who greets him at the airport and how Hey. When he landed in Saudi Arabia, there was a very deliberate snub. They sent a very junior prince to meet him at the airport. Whereas when Xi Jinping arrived, There was everybody was there. Mohammed bin Salman, huge state ceremony. And this is another sign of the Saudis again and again Saying, we're not gonna be told what to do by United States anymore. We want to be treated entirely as an equal partner. And, actually, We care much more about getting our relationships right with Israel, Iran, Syria than worrying about what the US Well, the Americans put out a very, very strong statement, saying they didn't leave Syria Merged Merged Readmission, all sanctions remain. On on that, for a complicated note, maybe we're gonna bring it to an end. We'll chat again at question time. Excellent.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nWelcome to another episode of The Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with me, Rory Stewart, we're sitting we're sitting in a a very strange barstool on a round table looking at each other in Harrogate.\n\nSpeaker 0: Through 2 very large microphones.\n\nSpeaker 1: Through 2 very large microphones. You're fortunately tall enough for me to be able to see you at the top. You can't see me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can't see you very well, ma'am. And we're we're going to, Later today, doing a live show in Harrogate.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very exciting. This, of course, is a place which was the the home of the Gilbert and Sullivan That's very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: I might do that. Now there's a lot to get through. We had a, I think, quite a significant speech by Keir Starmer over the weekend. We've had these, Frankly, bizarre conferences by groups, factions associated with the Conservative Party. We'll talk about the Turkish elections.\n\nI actually found the elections in Thailand more interesting. I've seen there's the no coverage in the UK media of it. We should talk about that as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: But let's start with Keir Starmer. I I don't know if you had time to read his speech, but he actually talked about how he felt the conservative party is no longer conservative.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I liked all all that stuff. I couldn't agree more with him on that. I thought that was very strong. So center of his speech, he says, as you said, that they've given up on family. They've given up on their international reputation.\n\nAnd he said, if people call me a conservative, I'm not gonna be ashamed if being a conservative means those kind of things. So It was a nice push at that part of the speech towards the kind of conservatism I care about. However, what do you think about the speech as a whole?\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought it It did a lot of things that I want him to do. It set out it was much more rounded about the kind of state of the world and the state of politics than he's been up to now. It's still, I think deliberately short on the the big ticket policy stuff. But I think this line that he used about, you're gonna get clause 4 on steroids. Clause 4, the big thing that Tony Blair did in 1994, changing the labor party constitution.\n\nI think what he's doing there is setting up the next stages, And he's gonna have to be held to that now. I think once you start to say things like that, you've got to come up\n\nSpeaker 1: with a quality idea. Tricky thing, isn't it? Just tell us where was it? Who was he speaking to? What was this?\n\nSpeaker 0: So it's a conference organized by, relatively new group called Progressive Britain, but who are on the progressive side of the Labour Party probably do want to push more on the on the big bold radical side of things rather than the Ming bars. But I I thought it was one of I really do think it was one of his better speeches, and I I quite like that out boldness of of saying we're coming on we're bringing tanks onto your lawn. And I do you know the other thing I think? This thing about the conservatives, If I think about you being a conservative, I think your conservatism is very much rooted in history, culture, tradition, not changing things unless you really need to. And they come along, they want to change the the sort of rate the health service, change the BBC, pollute our seas and rivers with Unimaginable quantities of human wastage.\n\nAnd it's not very conservative. And I thought that was a that was a smart place to be, But then the next bit of his kind of journey of leadership, I think, is going to be about taking 3 or 4 big areas where the big policy ideas come.\n\nSpeaker 1: And that's what we have to See. Because as you say, if you're gonna talk about clause 4 on steroids I mean, clause 4 was huge, probably the biggest thing that Labour Party had done. So Clause 4 on steroids, I didn't quite understand what that can be that's gonna be bigger than clause\n\nSpeaker 0: 4. 12.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I think\n\nSpeaker 0: clause clause 4. I mean,\n\nSpeaker 1: I think this is another problem, isn't it? For all these politicians that they have in their minds these radical moves. So the conservatives, obviously, completely obsessed with Margaret Thatcher. And one of their problems is that they keep working out how they can outdo Margaret Thatcher. But, of course, the things she's done can't be done twice.\n\nPrioritization, selling off council houses, restructuring the economy, and they're gonna be able to do them again. He's not gonna be able to get rid of clause 4 twice. What's what's the big reform that he's gonna bring to the Labour Party according to clause 4?\n\nSpeaker 0: What he's talking about, the reform of public services.\n\nSpeaker 1: But clause 4 was Was a reckoning with the party? Right? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: It was. But that's what you know, we've talked a lot about how leadership is about telling the party things it doesn't want to hear. People go on about clause clause 4, I think, much more because of the the symbolism the symbolism of that change. It wasn't it didn't really\n\nSpeaker 1: Remind us what Claws for what?\n\nSpeaker 0: What did it say? Oh, god. The ownership common ownership and means of just distribution supply. I remember production distribution supply. It was\n\nSpeaker 1: a sort of faintly Marxist It's a\n\nSpeaker 0: sounding course. And it was something which the Labour Party no longer believed. Even Dennis Skinner didn't really believe in that as a kind of, you know, economic policy. So it was symbolic, And then the policy change followed from that. And I think with these missions I did an event last night with Beth Wriggley from Sky, over the How To Academy.\n\nAnd so about 5 or 600 people there, Obviously, coming out on a Tuesday night to listen to me and Beth Rigby talk about a book about politics, they're interested in politics. Somebody asked a question about the missions, the 5 labor missions. And I and I asked for a show of hands in the audience, who has heard of the 5 labor missions? It was a minority. So my point on that is that they've still got to communicate the basic\n\nSpeaker 1: big picture of the time together as well. There is a messaging problem. I'm not sure He's quite tightened his language enough. So there were 3 big words that he was selling the speech. Do you remember what those words were?\n\nI I mean, I I can tell you\n\nSpeaker 0: what Respect. Yep. I\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't wanna put you on the spot, but it's service, respect, and stability. But even when you said Service, respect. But I mean, obviously, I love that stuff. Sounds very conservative. I love service, respect, stability.\n\nBut it doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it? Service, respect, stability. There's a lot of hesitancy going on.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's kind of him, though. I think this this this respect thing, I know, goes very deep with him.\n\nSpeaker 1: Sibilance. Service\n\nSpeaker 0: response. Okay. Okay. Well, that's that's a that's a biolinguistic point, I suppose, the major political strategic point. This respect thing is massive for him, I\n\nSpeaker 1: think. Are action words. That's another thing, maybe. As a communications expert, if I came to you and said my 3 big words, and I run a campaign on service, respect, and stability, It doesn't it's not a call to action, exactly, I said.\n\nSpeaker 0: But Gordon listen. Gordon ran on stability and did very, very well, but as a chancellor rather than as the leader of the party.\n\nSpeaker 1: You, would want To say stability, and this is what Gordon Brown did, if you are the government. Because as George Osborne was saying in our just to plug it, our leading interview, which Which is out this week. Just just go to your podcast feed, search for leading\n\nSpeaker 0: Leading George Osborne.\n\nSpeaker 1: George Osborne. Yeah. In that, he pointed out that, basically, you've got 2 strategies. Either you're in opposition, which case you say things gotta change Mhmm. Or you're in government, in which case you have to say stability, basically.\n\nYou have\n\nSpeaker 0: to say it was Gordon Gordon and society in opposition.\n\nSpeaker 1: You had a good phrase for it there, didn't you? You said, lot done.\n\nSpeaker 0: Lots done. Yep. Lots to do. Lots to lose.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and by the way, my friend Eddie Rama in Albania has just had the best election local election results ever. That's it. 55 municipalities to 6. On the lots done, lots to do, lots\n\nSpeaker 1: to lose. I obviously, Keir Starmer's not Gonna be particularly listening to me, but I think I do represent a certain kind of floating voter. And when I saw that speech, I felt there was still Not enough optimism, vision, and hope. There was quite a lot of I mean, he did quite a lot on How dare they bail out the bankers and make poor people pay to bail out banks? Now as far as I know, Labour Party policy at the time was to provide state support for those banks.\n\nHe's not laying out what the alternative is That's a grudge from 2008, 9? Mhmm. Who's he playing to there? Where's the where's where's the where's the constituency for that stuff?\n\nSpeaker 0: I I think that's the sort of, a a a labor a a sort of strong tribal labor base that really wants to hear the Tories getting the boot put in put into them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And did Tony Blair do that? Did you feel you had to do that in 95, 96?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah. I mean, Tony didn't like doing the, sort of, nasty negative stuff, but he could do it. I remember when he once remember when he did John Major over the dispatch box, week, week, week. And you could feel the blow loudly with each word. I remember he came out and said, I didn't like doing that.\n\nI said, yeah, but you did it. And I\n\nSpeaker 1: guess he did it on the He would have done it on the banning out of the European exchange rate. Like, there's more of that sort of stuff. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I think I think a little bit of Ion has entered Keir's soul post Sunak. I think he's been quite taken aback by how Quite nasty soon that can be. All this lefty lawyer stuff and and constant misrepresentation. He did it again the other day about the police numbers and the crime figures. And so I think I I don't know.\n\nI feel Keir's moved into a different gear, but but I still I agree with where I agree with you, I still want more in that page that says, this is what Britain's gonna be like if you have 10 years of a local government.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, we like I think there's a lovely phrase, that John McCain loved, which is that People like voting for a politician who's a happy warrior. They like the sense of the confident, happy optimism.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that was Johnson's strength.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was Johnson's strength, unfortunately. Yeah. But it would be nice to see a little bit of that here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now should we talk about the Tories? Yeah. You're a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, horrifying. Fine. So I'm looking at the list. So this is this is something that you've you've raised with us and called the National Conservatism Conference London, May 15th to 17th. Led and the confirmed speakers, Suella Braverman, Douglas Murray, Jacob Rees Mogg, Senator JD Vance from the US, Lee Anderson, Theodore Dalrymple, who writes these articles in The Spectator grumbling about generally grumbling about people on benefits As far as I can remember, David Frost, John Hayes, Melanie Phillips, Nigel Bigger, who's the theologian at Oxford, who's been doing revisionist history On the British Empire, Darren Grimes?\n\nIt's a pretty pretty astonishing group of people, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Terrific. Terrific. Also, I mean, Sumely Bravaman, she's the home secretary in a government led by Rishi Sunak, who yesterday was meeting Zelensky, The leader of Ukraine to talk about the next stage is in an incredibly important military confrontation with Russia. And his home secretary is topping the bill at an organization an an event organized essentially to tell Rishi Sunak that his domestic political strategy is autocock. And some of the speeches, Douglas Murray, who you mentioned, said he was talking about the, you know, there's nothing wrong with it.\n\nShe had this thing about there's nothing racist about wanting to stop immigrants coming into the country. I always have a problem with people who start There's nothing racist to that. It usually means they're going to go on to exploit racism if they can. She he Douglas Murray made this speech where he said that just because the Germans mucked picked up a couple of times in the last century, which doesn't mean we should stop feeling proud about our nationality. I mean, that is a pretty amazing historical analogy.\n\nJacob Rees Mogg, who sat in the cabinet when the voter ID registration bill was being put through, attacked Sunak for doing it and said it was gerrymandering. And Braverman, this this lot, honestly, if this was at the equip the left wing equivalent, the right wing papers would be going insane with this stuff. Braverman made this joke about Keir Starmer, who doesn't know the difference between a man and a woman, maybe he'll be end up being the 1st woman leader of the Labour Party. I mean, they're they're just it's pathetic stuff.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then then Danny Kruger had a big speech on the centrality of family and how\n\nSpeaker 0: Stick together when you hate each other Yeah. For the kids.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's it's pretty odd because it feels I mean, including the inclusion of a US Republican senators are in this.\n\nSpeaker 0: And also funded by an American think tank. It's all this sort of, you know, where's the money coming from stuff, which never gets asked of the right.\n\nSpeaker 1: But very much, this is People leaning into American cultural issues. And, of course, Lee Anderson, very central to all of that, who's who's the the vice chairman of the party.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, he's the guy who said on Deputy\n\nSpeaker 1: chairman of\n\nSpeaker 0: the party. Out loud, you know, The the last election, we had Boris, Brexit, and Corbyn. We've got none of those at the next. We've gotta have culture wars and trans.\n\nSpeaker 1: But this is why I was talking to a conservative cabinet minister yesterday who was saying that it seems likely, of course, that the conservatives will lose the next election.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is that what they think now?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not not exactly that's what they think. That's not a big revelation 21. But what was striking is how completely confident he was that when they lose, the leading candidates will be from the right, And the party will lurch the right in response to loss, and that and Kemi Badnock are the leaders to take over the party.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which you know what? If Labour do get in, Even with a small majority, it could be good for Labour. I think if the Tory party lurches into some sort of post Farageist Yukipari of culture war nonsense.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's very, very bad for the country.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I agree with that. I agree with that. I agree it's bad for the country. So I did that policies live program, and Danny Kruger was on the panel, and so was Shammy Chakrabarty. And Shammy and I Didn't always agree about stuff during\n\nSpeaker 1: the pandemic. Danny Danny Kruger was a big supporter of Boris Johnson. He was one of his private secretaries before he was elected. He was one of the key members of his administration. I wonder how he reconciles his very strong Christian views on marriage with being a strong supporter of Boris Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 0: Who knows? But what was really fascinating was we Shammy and I, at one point, were looking at each other because Danny Kruger was coming out with this stuff about he was looking at us and pointing at us and saying that This leftist, so I think he says something like morally transformative agendas. I'm wondering what the hell is he talking about? And then he comes up with his speech about, you know, couples should stay together for the kids, and I just thought the the whole thing felt weird. I'll tell you the other thing that really made me laugh.\n\nYou know the other organizer? We've talked about the the Napped Cons as they call themselves. But the day before, you had the other one, the the the Bannerman, Cruddus, Lord Cruddus, Boris Johnson fan and club, what's he called? Organization of Democratic, something like that. And somebody sent me The clips of Priti Patel, Nadine Dorries, Andrea Jenkins, and Cruddas speaking.\n\nYou know that thing they have in the corner of the screen which tells you how many people are watching online live. The highest was 66.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you were one of them?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I wasn't one of them. Somebody said to me, I record 25 of them were Tory MPs who've now got shows on GB News where they talked about this amazing conference that they were all at. But we do give them we're probably doing the same now. We're giving them far too much attention. But on Pravamen, what so when Rees Mogg came out and said to that conference yesterday, he said, We will be toast.\n\nWe'll be finished if we try and change the leader again. I wonder if, actually, he was trying to signal in a very misleading way to Sunak that his position is tape when actually it's not safe at all.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well and and, of course, one of the extraordinary things is that Tory MPs always say that and then often go on and change leaders. I mean, it's it's a knee jerk reaction. They said it will be tested if we get rid of Boris Johnson. Will be tested if we get rid of Liz Truss. I think Rishi Sunak did something which was Brave and correct, which was to get rid of this bill, which was going to rip up EU legislation.\n\nBut it's a very, very risky, dangerous thing he did within his party because He got elected on a manifesto. You remember he had a\n\nSpeaker 0: Video of a shredder?\n\nSpeaker 1: A video of a shredder. And that has really wound up the Brexit right who feel profoundly Trade. And, actually, in this, extremely bad tempered exchange you had on news night, you had, you had a was it on news night? Was this\n\nSpeaker 0: Bad tempered exchange.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, with that lady on it was news side. Right? Yeah. It was news side. In that, I noticed she was also laying into Rishi Sunak And questioning whether he was really a Brexiteer and saying, you know, that he had betrayed his promises.\n\nHe didn't really believe in the whole project. So He's got a very, very difficult job trying to hold that transaction together.\n\nSpeaker 0: We should probably talk a little bit about the news and I think, but did that not, Damaged Badnock as well, because she's the one who had to present the the whole thing to the commons as being pinned.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think it must be difficult for her.\n\nSpeaker 0: So that helps Braverman?\n\nSpeaker 1: Probably does. Yeah. Probably does. Although it might make Cali Bad not paradoxically, there are still probably a 100 Tory MPs who see them more sells more on the center left of the party.\n\nSpeaker 0: So do you think I strayed from the disagreeing agreeably path of enlightenment in the Roy Stewart here at My Life. Well, I\n\nSpeaker 1: don't know. I occasionally do it myself. What I notice being a a a sinner myself, is Is that is that certainly Shoshana watching it doesn't like seeing either of us getting shouty? She didn't I mean, when she was watching with me, she didn't particularly blame you for But she thought the whole tone of the thing as a as a watcher. You cease to take in the the arguments, and you begin to face it.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm I'm just very glad that Fiona was in bed and didn't here. And when she saw I was trending in Twitter on Twitter the next morning, she said, what have you done? I said, I just on Newsnight last night, it was a bit of a bit of a problem and, got a bit aerated. She didn't watch it. So explain tell\n\nSpeaker 1: us a bit about it for people who didn't watch it.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I put out a speech as I was doing that night about Europe, which I wanted to be about my desire that Labour become a bit bolder on calling out the Brexit disaster. And because the soon I could announce that they were scrapping the the retained EU law bill. They asked me if I would go on. I thought I was going to be on go on with a Jacob Riessmaul Gora, a Farage, or something like that. Maybe I don't follow these things as close as I should, but I I'd actually I didn't even know who she was.\n\nI couldn't quite believe\n\nSpeaker 1: And she was an MEP She's a former MEP.\n\nSpeaker 0: She's now an adviser to Richard TICE, the Reform Party.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, UKIP and EPO? Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Or the Brexit party. Brexit party. And Before this before we went in there, the Israeli the an Israeli MP was about to go on after us with the Palestinian ambassador. I was talking to the Palestinian ambassador about Middle East peace process, and such like.\n\nAnd she she got into conversation and started to try to tell the Palestinian ambassador that people in working class areas in and their cost of living was rising because of Brexit. To which he looked and said, do you know anything about inflation and how the economy works on inflation? So that I just thought This is not going\n\nSpeaker 1: So so it wasn't going well in the green room?\n\nSpeaker 0: It wasn't going badly, but it wasn't going great. And then in the interview, she just came out with stuff that was it's just Utter bilge and factually inaccurate and, you just get sick of it after a while. What I didn't like myself for doing was turning on Victoria Derbyshire. I think I probably did that because\n\nSpeaker 1: And Victoria Burch, the BBC interviewer.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Who actually I I do think there's been a problem with the BBC according out these Brexiters. I mean, you know, the fact that Nigel Farage has been under question time more than any other politician in history is ridiculous. They very rarely get pinned to the wall. Well, even last night new for Arsenal Newsnight last night saying Brexit is a disaster.\n\nHe's now just commenting on it despite having been one of the great creators of it. So I got very aerated with with Victoria. But to be honest, it's one of those things, end of a long day.\n\nSpeaker 1: And do you find the process of publishing your book And the reviews and the interviews and all this stuff. Is it stressful? Because sometimes what's happening is people are kinda dredging up your past, Chucking the Iraq war at you, chucking your time in Downing Street at you. Is that unpleasant for you? Do you have quite a thick skin?\n\nDo you worry about it?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't no. I I don't. I quite enjoy look, I there will come a point, probably in a couple of weeks, where I'll think, well, I've done the book and I'll move on to the next thing. So now on the way here, I went to a school, just down the road, and I really enjoyed it. Young kids, really engaged in politics, All of them getting a book for the asking a question, all that sort of stuff.\n\nAnd it was so that sort of stuff I enjoy. I should I don't know if you're aware, Rory, but I did Invent another new word yesterday, podoltery.\n\nSpeaker 1: Podoltery? Podoltery.\n\nSpeaker 0: I committed podoltery yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yes. I was invited on that So I'm supposed to be asking a surprise question to you on that show. You went on newsagents.\n\nSpeaker 0: I did. Yeah. So you have to do certain things. As you will find out when Politics On the Edge is published in September. You have to do all sorts of\n\nSpeaker 1: of pedultory.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I did a bit of pedultory. And What I what was interesting, you mentioned Iraq, they actually taught a lot about these changes that we had around. They were singing your praises as an interviewer, And they were saying they thought that you got more out of me on Iraq than anybody else ever had.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's very kind. I don't\n\nSpeaker 0: agree with that, but, you know, that's what they thought. Listen. Just\n\nSpeaker 1: just a You know,\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't find it that difficult. I just I know when I'll have reached the end of But but\n\nSpeaker 1: but it's not been too painful. No. I was in Paris yesterday, and I was in a square outside the Senate, where for 5 months, Catholic protesters were protesting a change on surrogate mothers. And I was reminded how very different the culture wars are in places like France from the culture wars here. In France and the United States, So much of it is driven by religion.\n\nAnd whatever's happening in the National Conservatism Conference, the culture wars of Lee Anderson and Stoking up here. It feels to me as though Britain is still a much, much more secular society. And so despite the fact you get, You know, JD Vance, who's a US senator, wanted to talk about keeping the family together and all that stuff. It's got a completely different resonance in the US, or even, I think, in Catholic countries in Europe\n\nSpeaker 0: To the rest of the What's the issue in France?\n\nSpeaker 1: So that was I I'm just reminded of it again. Again, I keep forgetting that one of the things that It's a continual challenge. It's that there is still a conservative religious Catholic element in in in French politics that doesn't like Liberal progressive reforms brought in by Francois, your friend Francois, on on things like surrogate mothers. And I was just reminded that for 5 months, It's sat on\n\nSpeaker 0: the square\n\nSpeaker 1: outside the senate protesting it. And the What about\n\nSpeaker 0: the assisted dying thing? Is that not seen as a religious thing? Because Macron's moving the dial on that pretty fast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think I think it's a huge thing. And I think we underestimate how much in all these countries, when you and I naturally applaud progress in Ireland France on all these issues, how there is often 40% of the population that remains very, very uncomfortable about these things. I'm probably very resentful of the\n\nSpeaker 0: politicians that introduced them. Right. On that note, we'll take a break.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome back to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Alastair looking Extremely sort of fresh, notwithstanding the middle of his book tour.\n\nSpeaker 0: Looking fresh? Yeah. I\n\nSpeaker 1: think it looked pretty fresh. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: I did swim this morning.\n\nSpeaker 1: Doing well? You went for another one of your cold swims?\n\nSpeaker 0: I did. Very Pretty good.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not recall\n\nSpeaker 0: at the moment. 16 degrees.\n\nSpeaker 1: Was that in London or here in Yorkshire, where we\n\nSpeaker 0: recorded Lido.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's not I\n\nSpeaker 0: might find somewhere in West Yorkshire tomorrow. Now what's the population of Turkey?\n\nSpeaker 1: Population of Turkey? I don't know what's the population. 85,200,000.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very good. Thailand, 71.6.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is roughly the same as United Kingdom.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. And how much have you heard on the British media about the elections in Thailand?\n\nSpeaker 1: Very little. Are Are you gonna tell us about them?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think they're fascinating because the party that's been running the place, which is very pro military And pro king. And Very Pro King, have been absolutely battered. A party that's clearly taken a lot of lessons from Emmanuel Macron calling itself the Move Forward Party. You could always say, em barge. Progressive, youth led.\n\nActually, At the heart of their campaign, something that could be seen as a crime because they're actually calling for reform of the monarchy, And they have the whole Les Majesticet thing that you're not allowed to it's 15 years top sentence for criticizing the the monarchy. Or indeed their pets. Probably their pets. Exactly. Or anything they wear.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: They have campaigned on reducing the power of the military, ending conscription, new constitution, and they've done incredibly well.\n\nSpeaker 1: One one way I saw it described is that what made them different From the party that came second, which is the traditional populist party, is, as you say, their focus is on institutional reform. People didn't really think they we're gonna get anywhere. Institutional reform's not usually a sexy subject. People argued that the reform to the constitution, the election rules made it very difficult for this party to come through. And despite New types of electoral system, which is a parallel system that first past the post, that PR, they've managed to come romping through over 30% of the vote.\n\nSpeaker 0: And then the parties with which the Former prime minister Priyat Chanocha is associated. Between them, he's got 2 parties, one that used to run and one that now does 76 between us. So they're finished. But what's terrible about this whole system is that the prime minister now has to be chosen by a by 250 members of the senate who have been appointed by the military. So even though these guys have won, it's not clear how they're gonna put together a coalition.\n\nBut it is an absolute we're going about populism, and we'll as we talk about Erdogan. This is a total defeat of the populists.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's it's it's extraordinary. It's a defeat for the populists, and it's a defeat for the crusty military Conservatives who are sort of 2 different bits of Thailand for a new progressive movement that's very exciting and took credible numbers of seats in Bangkok, Took a lot of seats in Chiang Mai, which is the 2nd largest city led by this charismatic Mhmm. A graduate from actually the Harvard Kennedy School where I used to teach a bit. He Was there when I was there? I didn't think he took my classes.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is Peter Limjaroie Nat. And then the other guy, the the one of the candidates who who led The youth movement and the the protests against the government in 2020 is still in his twenties and he won of won one of these seats in in Bangkok. And I think they owned I think they won all but one of the constituents in Bangkok. So it's a pretty big story, but, and then you've you've now got this, whether they'll be able to form a government on the basis that they can they're going to deliver on some of these promises of reforming the military and reforming the The monarchy will wait and see.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so, like, little little potted history of, Thailand. So the Thailand was ruled for More than 70 years by the current king's father, who ruled at the kind of length that queen Elizabeth the second or the emperor Hirohito ruled, all the way from just after the 2nd World War through the 2000. Was very much caught up in US cold war politics because you remember the domino theory, and the whole idea was that if Vietnam fell, Thailand was gonna be the next to fall. So the US really invested in the fifties sixties and trying to back generally quite right wing anti communist governments in Thailand. In 92, it had its breakthrough into democracy, which the old king was incredibly important 4, a bit like, I think, the king of Spain coming in after Franco.\n\nThere was a very famous image where the general and the main opposition leader knelt in front of the king, and the king basically told them to get on with the elections. And this vision of these 2 people kneeling in front of him was incredibly important. And it was, of course, one of the real economic miracles. This is a country which, in 1980, had a GDP per capita about $1500, And it's now up at $10,000 per capita in in in not even in purchasing power parity terms in In absolute dollar terms, was hit very hard by this financial crisis in 97, bounced back by about 2004, 5. And even with all these changes, because there were these horrible military coups, which have happened now twice in the since 2000, At a time when you felt the world was ever more democratizing, Thailand was the exception to the rule, military coup's happening, but still hasn't off the course of very, very impressive economic rate, slightly reduced by the military, but still one of the great miracles to Stream poverty rate in Thailand are now something like 0.03%\n\nSpeaker 0: of people. Do you give directly work there?\n\nSpeaker 1: Living under $2? No. We don't because it's much too wealthy. Now given that we want to be prosecuted under the Thai laissez majestay rules, let me just tell people a little bit about the king of Thailand, which nobody's allowed\n\nSpeaker 0: to talk\n\nSpeaker 1: about. We\n\nSpeaker 0: don't want to be prosecuted.\n\nSpeaker 1: We don't want to be prosecuted.\n\nSpeaker 0: We like the fact that we can criticize our own king, though very, very few people do, especially you. Have you ever criticized our king?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. I I know.\n\nSpeaker 0: And is that a point of principle?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I do really admire him. I I do think he's wonderful. King Vajiralonkom, who's the current king, do you know where he lives? No. Munich lives in Bavaria.\n\nSpeaker 0: Frame. Why? Why?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's actually a sort of family tradition. His his father, largely, until he became king, lived in Switzerland. But it appears that, he has a a lady love, and he has been spending most of his time living in Bavaria. And this is one of the Large objections of the Thai people that they're keen\n\nSpeaker 0: Do they all know that?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Everyone knows that.\n\nSpeaker 0: How do they know that if you can't criticize them?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's difficult to get the news out, but occasionally it Comes out. I mean, something comes up for things like WikiLeaks. So the US ambassador wrote this wonderful report about air chief marshal Foo Foo, who was the poodle belonging to the king who turned up at a diplomatic reception dressed in a full evening gear, Including Diamante little, shoes that covered, I guess, his paws and was allowed to dance over the tables drinking from the US ambassador's drink. Also in WikiLeaks, was a famous video of Phu Fu's birthday hosted by the king And the queen who appeared topless for the for the birthday party. So anyway, the king's reputation as a party boy, he's now 70 years old.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Living in Munich.\n\nSpeaker 1: Living in Munich, and the relationships with Foo Foo, and what's called his profound moments of eccentricity Compared to the very, very revered status of his father, who for 70 years was seen as an extraordinary sort of force for for good and religious Just propriety in Thailand is is at the heart of\n\nSpeaker 0: But does King not have to do stuff in Thailand? Does he keep him to flip back to Thailand to do ceremonial stuff? No.\n\nSpeaker 1: He he he doesn't do very much No. And in fact, there was a tradition in the Tyrell House of not doing very much that. Quite a lot of them in the twenties thirties were ruling from Europe.\n\nSpeaker 0: Turkey? Turkey. Erdogan's gonna win.\n\nSpeaker 1: Erdogan's gonna win because he so it's gone to a runoff\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: May 26th, I think.\n\nSpeaker 0: 28th.\n\nSpeaker 1: May 20th, very good, but he almost got it 49% of the votes. So it's gonna be very, very difficult for him not to make it through.\n\nSpeaker 0: Also the guy who's taken the 5%, the 3rd guy, he's even further to the right than the Erdogan. So it's very hard to see that 5% going back to the opposition.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. And the opposition leader, to add to his problems, had Support from the Kurdish party, and Erdogan's whipping up the fact he had support from the Kurdish party to turn up and considerate. I mean, there's a Small hope that now people see Erdogan as vulnerable. Mhmm. They may change their minds in the election.\n\nSo I wouldn't completely He writes it off, but it looks like he's gonna be able to win.\n\nSpeaker 0: The thing is it that's interesting. We talked a bit about the I mean, I think we have been consistent about saying that we think that Erdogan probably would end up winning, But he actually did incredibly well in the earthquake zones where there'd been an assumption that they'd handle it so badly.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I you remember, we did a podcast when I was in the earthquake scenes. And I was actually quite struck by how much the Turkish state had mobilized. He'd moved governors who are like French prefaces. They sort of appointed people down. And I was in a room with 1 of these Turkish governors running the response near Gaziantep, and it was pretty impressive.\n\nIf he had all the military and the police, and they lined up, they had the maps out. They were and trucks were pouring in. So I I can see that working. In a sense, that's what he made his reputation. He made his reputation.\n\nErdogan made his reputation in Istanbul in the nineties As a guy who got things done, he was and even when he was president, it was all about the fact he doubled the number of roads in the country. He massively increased water supply, bridges. He loves big public infrastructure.\n\nSpeaker 0: He also did a huge Public sector pay deal just before the election. I mean, like, huge for and big raising the minimum wage, big civil service pay rises. And I guess the other thing I mean, Jonathan Powell's brother, Chris, who's quite involved in politics in different parts the world. And he he was involved with the the Istanbul mayor, Imamoglu, who we've talked about before, who I think would have been a much better for opposition leader.\n\nSpeaker 1: Then Of\n\nSpeaker 0: course, they have managed to get him stuck away in jail for a bit because he criticized the election authorities which are entirely appointed by Erdogan. And And, also, it was strange watching I watched the, I actually took a leaf out of your book, and I watched it, the live coverage on Al Jazeera, which was pretty good to be honest. They are with Sean Robertson and and the CNN. But what was when you saw the numbers all being announced by the official Turkish news agency, which is pretty much controlled by Erdogan, And it was clearly designed to try to make the opposition people who were watching the the the the vote counting just give up. And and so they held in, and they're going to they they're they're still there.\n\nThey're still in the fight, but I find it very, very hard. Unless because the turnout was so high, it was something about 88 point 2%. Unbelievable. 82%. And so it's very hard to see where those people who might think, oh my god.\n\nYeah. Maybe we could beat him, given that the polls were saying that was going to happen anyway. So he's sort of\n\nSpeaker 1: So those turn up figures are unbelievable, aren't they? I mean, I don't think anyone gets this kind of turn up figures.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. See, well, other than you unless you have compulsory voting. The other thing I looked into, The Turk a lot of Turks, obviously, living around the European Union. The vote for Erdogan in the 1,500,000 Turks living in Germany, 65.4%.\n\nSpeaker 1: So very, very struck by how much German politicians are interacting with this, partly because I mean, as you say, you had a figure of just over a1000000. But in fact, 3,000,000 Germans, I think, were born in Turkey, and 7,000,000 have Turkish ancestry.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And and and because the Germans have been quite tight on giving them German passports. A lot of them will still be Turkish citizens, even more than and it was even higher in the Netherlands. 68% of the Netherlands, 64% of France and 71% of Turks living in Austria\n\nSpeaker 1: Voting for Erdogan.\n\nSpeaker 0: Voting for Erdogan. And a lot of them I I read a thing in Bild Zeitung where they were saying that the reason is because they really resent the way that European politicians talk about Turkey and talk about Erdogan.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was thinking about his career. I was also thinking about the the similarities both of them went to, quite conservative Islamist backgrounds. Erdogan grew up As a teenager, literally on the street selling water bottles, selling Simit, which is like a big pretzel, then didn't probably go to university. He claims he did, but There's no real record of that. Was a footballer, so you'd relate to that.\n\nAnd, anyway, old group was also actually a semifredion footballer with Gold Coast.\n\nSpeaker 0: He's got a very he's the other one's got a very Kind of let it go. Well, he's he never smiles, does he? It's very strange as a politician.\n\nSpeaker 1: But then he became I remember from the nineties through to about 2014 was such a kind of hopeful figure. When when he came in in the early 2000, he very, very quickly did these amazing reforms. He He said very progressive things about gay rights. He got rid of the death penalty. He tried to run a peace process with the Kurds.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But a\n\nSpeaker 1: lot of this was about EU accession. And when that began going sour In about 2014 and we talk about 2014 as the beginning of the age of populism in a sense because that's when Modi comes in in India. That's when ISIS take Mosul. And that's the point at which Things change with with Erdogan. That's the point at which he becomes president.\n\nSpeaker 0: Essentially, we say that because I hadn't really thought about it because I've forgotten it. But when We've talked before about the 1st time with Tony that we met Putin. Similar with Erdogan, he was seen as a a kind of reformist, west leaning, On pro Atlanticist. And this campaign I mean, Biden has been a big part of this campaign. Essentially, he's been saying, You know, vote for me to put Biden in his place.\n\nIt's it's a almost a complete reversal of where he was.\n\nSpeaker 1: Obama's 1st international trip and first big Speech was made in Turkey in 2009 because Turkey was seen as this fantastic example of moderate Islamists, Western friendly NATO members trying to join the European Union and a model for what Syria could be, Iraq Could be all these other countries could be without an invasion, without an intervention, a sort of positive, locally led move. And then suddenly from 2014 onwards, It all begins to go pretty horribly wrong. There's this coup, which there's still lots of questions about. Was it a real coup against him? Was it a coup he himself staged?\n\nHe then drove this crackdown, which ended up with 91,000 people being arrested. Mhmm. A whole areas of self-service cleaned out. Then he brought through a new constitution that he got through on a 52/48 referendum. You can remember that kind of stuff, which basically strengthened the power of the presidency against judicial.\n\nHe built a $300,000,000 presidential palace. Started flirting with the Russians. Bought their air defense systems. Started getting very, very aggressively involved in Somalia, in Libya, and this kind of Ottoman expansion muscle Stuff. And then went full on eccentric on his economic policy in 2018.\n\nIt's still there? Yeah. Where he wiped out half the value of his currency in a year, drove incredible numbers of companies to bankruptcy with an absolute and we we talk about It's the opposite of austerity. He was a great believer in borrow, borrow, borrow, and putting the interest rates as low as possible.\n\nSpeaker 0: We still do. With inflation, well, it's coming down a little bit now. Way, way, way beyond what most countries do. I mean, you've taken us neatly into that that part another thing happening in in that part of the world that you've been talking about, which is Syria, back in the Arab League. Is is this another string to the bow of David Miliband talking about the age of impunity?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's extraordinary, isn't it? So that is An announcement has just come out, and it's been led by Saudi Arabia and UAE and opposed by Jordan And Qatar. Yeah. It's absolutely astonishing. I mean, heartbreaking for the Syrian opposition because they famously gave speeches in the Arab League 10 years ago.\n\nThey were\n\nSpeaker 0: given the the Syrian seat, weren't they? Absolutely. And so the yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and now find themselves absolutely out on the cold. Meanwhile, the Syrian economy, we we've been talking a lot about Thailand, Turkey, Syria. I just had some figures that I that I was looking at about how these different countries have fared since 1980. So Thailand, GDP per capita, $700 in 1980, $8,000 today, 11 times richer. Turkey, $2,000, 1980, $10,000 today, 5 times richer.\n\nVery, very, you know, impressive stuff. South Korea, 15 times growth. But Syria, Syria has gone from a situation in which they were at $2,000 in 1980, Reached $10,000 in 2007 and are now down at $1,200 per capita. They have Basically pushed 30% of their population to extreme poverty, 70% now unemployed. And they've gone from being, an upper middle income country to being one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\nSpeaker 0: 200,000 of them are dead in the Current situation. The other thing I didn't realize was the extent to which one of the reasons why the Saudis are so keen to get this thing sorted is because they Mohammed bin Salman, as he goes towards his vision in 2030, doesn't want his neighbors kind of, you know, with all this trouble going on. But I hadn't realized that this drug, Captagon and amphetamine, is now Syria's largest export. It's effectively become a mafia state. And and members of of his family, Assad's family, are sanctioned because of their trade in this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And this drug And and the British, have put out a paper saying that 80% of the world trade in Captagon. So Captagon is, As you said, it's amphetamine related to Phenylephrine, which some of us get in our cold medication. Obviously, this is\n\nSpeaker 0: You were the you were the drugs expert on this podcast taking opium. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. What\n\nSpeaker 0: does this one do to you, this captain?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so originally developed in the 19 sixties to deal with attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy. And then by the early seventies, people began cutting down on its use because of its psychotic effects. And by the middle of the eighties, almost nobody was producing it anymore. And then a Bulgarian gang began shipping it through with Balkan traders into the Middle East, developed a huge market for it in places like UAE and Saudi. They then moved their production facilities.\n\nThe Bulgarians, the Turks cracked down on this, in the early 2000. Production facilities started again in Syria. And according to the British, The Syrian regime and Assad is currently making 3 times the volume of trade of the Mexican drug cartels, this thing called Captagon.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's incredible, but, I mean, virtually, everything in the world knows about the Mexican drug cartels, but I didn't even know about this until recently.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it Sorry. And and the Saudis just found, I think, 4,600,000 pills hidden in flour. The UAE has just found pills hidden in green bean shipments, And it's all coming through from Syria.\n\nSpeaker 0: The so the the Jordanians, there's a new committee being set up with the Saudis, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, who are looking at all these issues, amnesties, return of refugees, drug smuggling and how to rein in Russian and Iranian influence. That's quite a big agenda.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and it seems to me they'll achieve none of those things. I think another thing that is difficult here. Is it's another sign of the way in which the Saudi US relationship is breaking apart? Because the US has been very, very clear that they do not like the idea of normalizing relationships with Bashar al Assad. And there's a pattern now of Saudi Deliberately poking the United States in the eye, partly because they feel humiliated.\n\nPartly Biden, called them a prior state. Trump refused to Support Saudi when there were these attacks from Houthi again the Houthi Iranian backed terrorists against, oil terminals. But since Mohammed bin Salman's come in, There's been a lot of this stuff. Do you remember when the US made requests on their oil production because of sanctions against Ukraine, Russia? They completely ignored it And basically help the Russians with their move on.\n\nWe talked about the theatricality of Biden's visit to Northern Ireland and who greets him at the airport and how Hey. When he landed in Saudi Arabia, there was a very deliberate snub. They sent a very junior prince to meet him at the airport. Whereas when Xi Jinping arrived, There was everybody was there. Mohammed bin Salman, huge state ceremony.\n\nAnd this is another sign of the Saudis again and again Saying, we're not gonna be told what to do by United States anymore. We want to be treated entirely as an equal partner. And, actually, We care much more about getting our relationships right with Israel, Iran, Syria than worrying about what the US Well,\n\nSpeaker 0: the Americans put out a very, very strong statement, saying they didn't leave Syria Merged Merged Readmission, all sanctions remain.\n\nSpeaker 1: On on that, for a complicated note, maybe we're gonna bring it to an end. We'll chat again at question time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Excellent.",
