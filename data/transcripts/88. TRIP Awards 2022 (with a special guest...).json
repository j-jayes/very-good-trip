Well, welcome to The Rest is Politics Awards with me, Alastair Campbell. And me, Rory Stewart. And this, I I'm gonna I'll just give you a bit of credit for this, the awards. So I'm gonna be guided by you a little bit through the system. So what we've done, Roel, why we we've just worked out a few categories, and each of us have to to pick, a person, an event, whatever it might be, To fit these categories, outstanding, politicians, event of the year, surprise of the year, moment of the year, film of the year, all sorts of things. Is it is it all about the World Cup, Or there's some other stuff I'm gonna try and get through without even mentioning the World Cup. Oh. Because unlike you, I'm just not obsessed with football. I'm just not a massive football fan of you. And then at the end, we're going to have a lifetime achievement award. But on that one, we have to agree. On all the others, we don't have to agree. We can say what we like. So the first one is outstanding British politician of the year. Gosh. Well, as a starter for 10 then, maybe the big theme of the end of the year is the way in which We have moved a little bit away, I guess, from the extremes of populism of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. And in their different ways, Keir Starmer and the Labour Party Has, I think, completed the transition away from Jeremy Corbyn, made them a really serious electable party, you You know, many, many points ahead. I know what they are. 20, 30 points ahead on the polls at the moment. And Rishi Sunak has, for for all the grumbles we've done on the show, Definitely, compared to Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, brought a bit more sort of sanity and restraint back to the conservative party. So So So in your in your classic establishment way, Rory, you're going for the leaders. You go for the 2 leaders of the 2 main parties. I'm going to the backbenches. Oh, go on, man. And I'm also going to the Tory backbenches. Go on. And my 2022 politician of the year is Charles Walker. Charles Walker. Sir Charles Walker. Go and tell us about him then. Well, the reason I like I've I've always liked Charles Walker because he was one of the 1st MPs of any party to come out openly and say that he had mental health problems, that he'd struggled all his life with OCD. But I think the reason he's impressed me this year In a pretty unimpressive parliament, it has to be said, is he has genuine this is a guy who's never been in ministry. He's been an MP for 20 odd years. He's never been a minister. But he has genuinely spoken truth to power with real passion and conviction. He did it to Johnson when Johnson was falling apart. He was one of the first people to Called on Trust to Go said she was an absolute disgrace and a shambles, that she couldn't he couldn't imagine why anybody would would vote for her. And I think I remember as well when During the COVID, period, when he was he seemed to me you had all these kind of anti vaxxers who were really, really irritating, but he just had a passionate snip to kind of view that we were doing massive mental health damage by locking people up for so long. We weren't thinking through the consequences. So I'm going for Charles Walker. Well, that's that's great. So I I I always liked him very much. I mean, he's incredibly so he's the stepson of an MP. He's he's sort of the kind of guy who I thought would be Almost a kind of pinup conservative MP of the 19 fifties. He's very kinda good looking, very charming, but as you say, has very much been a professional backbencher. He's a big Stalwart of the 1922 committee, which was this it's the backbench kind of engine room of the conservative party. He could be very funny in the House of Commons. He'd make these I I once saw him make a speech that I think was about 4 words long. If not now, when? Oh, very good. Oh, goodness gracious me. Although, yeah, you actually knew that? That was the that was true. Money, that was him calling for a referendum, so I didn't like him for that. No. Although, yeah, I noticed in the new European, which we sometimes promote a little bit on the show Yeah. He gave an interview in 2019 saying, Brexiteer MP, colon, I was an idiot to ever think a referendum was a good idea. I like him even better. So one of the nice things is he's he's quite he's quite good unlike most MPs that Sort of contradicting himself. He says, I'm an idiot. I'm happy to admit to your listeners I'm an idiot. So So there we are. That's the 1st award. Outstanding UK politicians are Charles Walker from me and Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak from Rory. Now outstanding overseas politician of the year. And I guess this was just really boring, isn't it? Because this one this one, such an obvious choice Currently at Washington. I know. But we gotta avoid him. We're not not allowed to say we're not allowed not allowed to say Zelensky if that's what we've got. I think we probably I think we should probably say Zelensky, but here's a great question from Alex Skitt. Outside of Zelensky and Putin, if you could pick 1 hero and 1 villain of 2022, Who would it be and why? And I think I'm gonna go for Joe Biden. I think Joe Biden has just been extraordinary this year. I mean, yes, he's very old, and, yes, he looks A bit doddery at times, and he gets his words all bottled up. But I think, you know, we've seen it just in recent days with Zelensky in Washington. For all that Johnson tried to take the credit on Ukraine, Biden has really showed incredible global leadership on Ukraine. He's done some pretty remarkable things on the domestic front. And he's just a very, very nice bloke. It's it's extraordinary, isn't it? I mean, I'm I'm in the US at the moment, and The last acts of this Democratic Party dominated Senate congress is gonna be to vote through another very, very large package of support for Ukraine, But there's an extraordinary dissonance because you're absolutely right. Objectively, he's got through this big stimulus package, One of the biggest environment climate packages ever passed in the United States, probably the biggest, he's done very well in Ukraine, but on the other hand, Everybody that I talk to in Washington who works closely with him literally says it's like the end of the film of El Cid. He's like this He's this dead corpse being put on a horse and ridden out. So there's this sort of weird discrepancy between the sense of him being very Apparently, in public, decrepit, and forgetful, while at the same time getting these amazing things done. I'd like a shout out, though, too, to your friend Macron. I know he embarrassed himself a little bit, I thought, on the on the World Cup pitch. There we are. I got World Cup reference in. You're obsessed, or are you obsessed? He did he did succeed in seeing off, Le Pen in the elections. Yeah. We obviously had a major criticism last week of him, which is the way in which he's got in the way of blocking a lot of the accession of countries like Bosnia and Serbia to the EU, which was a very important part of what was drawing people into peace in the Balkans. But all that aside, I think he is a genuinely Extraordinary figure. I mean, it's incredible how he's reinvented French politics, how he's shown that being an independent could work, how he reshaped the entire party system. I mean, I think If great politicians are creative people who create new circumstances, Macron certainly seems to have done that. And so if we're not allowed Putin as the as the worst foreign politician of the year, I think we probably agreed that he is, but if we're not allowed him, I think I'm gonna go for Lukashenko, his poodle in Belarus. In fact, I one of the, more interesting things I did this week this year rather was the contact I had with the Belarus opposition who are some pretty, you know, fantastic people who are doing some very, very brave things. And in fact, you mentioned the new European. Let's give them another plug. They did a big piece that we got the opposition to do a big piece, and it was all about Putin's poodle and, and so forth. But, you know, Lukashenko is one of the few last standing enablers. I guess Xi is to some extent in that Xi could, you know, he could push harder against him, but I'm I'm going for Lukashenko as Putin's sidekick. I I in 2003 when I just finished in Iraq sorry, 2005, just finished in Iraq and I was looking for a new job in the foreign office And somebody tried to, encourage me to apply to be the ambassador in Belarus and said, it's a great opportunity, 2005. Lukashenko's on his way out. This is the last dictatorship on the edge of the European Union. You need to get in there as the ambassador in 2005, and you'll have an amazing 3 years bringing Belarus Into the fold of the European Union and spreading democracy to the edge of Russia. You're not tempted. Here we are 17 years later. I might have That that that would have been a good job. You don't know. You might have made a difference. So what about domestic domestic worst politician of the year? I suppose Johnson and Truss are runaway winners. Well, I I must say Liz Truss was pretty astonishing. I mean, she doesn't I mean, Boris Johnson, you know, As I keep saying, he's the most monstrous human being but has a certain kind of political skill. I mean, he he Won elections. He almost got himself back in again, voted in by the Conservative MPs. He's standing against a great survivor. Liz Truss, I mean, I cannot think of a more catastrophic period, sadly, as prime minister for 200 or 300 years. I mean, it broke records in every way as well as breaking the The British economy. On the international side, though, a a little shout out for Pedro Castillo, who's who, although he lasted a bit longer than Liz Truss, is a pretty Astonishing combination of both being pretty uninspiring, this is the president of Peru, ex president of Peru, pretty uninspiring individual, not great Intellectual skills and development, but also managed to culminate in trying to do a massive Anti constitutional coup d'etat, full on populism trying to dissolve his own legislature and has ended up, as you pointed out last week, in jail. Yeah. But you say he's not inspiring, but he is partly inspiring from jail these people to go out and fight on the streets, and it's really it's leading us rather a lot of bloodshed. That's true. That's true. I mean, he's a full on left wing populist. I mean, I think he's and I was thinking about this also with Jeremy Corbyn, who's been popping up a bit on Twitter in the last, last couple of weeks, holding forth on the World Cup, hold holding forth on Palestine and the normal Germany competition. Which we all wholly thought that the World Cup is exclusively your preserve. Exactly. Exactly. Jeremy Corbyn and I are competing for who is more expert on the subject of football. But It is extraordinary thinking back to 2017 and the fact that he could pack Glastonbury and have the entire crowd Chanting, oh oh, Jeremy Corbyn. I mean, it's it's, it it is extraordinary and how somebody who I, certainly, when I entered politics in 2010, Was a joke. I mean, I remember the Labour front bench, when he spoke, would all sort of turn around and laugh, and people would walk out of the chamber when he'd try Speak and Well, Artie Artie Roy, when on the day that David Cameron won the election against Ed Miliband, And I've been helping Ed a bit during the campaign, and I was down at, Labour Party headquarters, and they asked me to go and do the media round down on College Green. And I was due to do Radio 5 with Peter Allen, Radio 5 live. And I was went over to the tent, and they said, oh, Jeremy Corbyn's in there, at the moment doing an interview. Would you mind doing it together? And I said, well, I don't mind, but, you know, you better ask him. And so he didn't mind. So we ended up doing this interview together where I was saying that, you You know, just saying nice things about aired, but then saying the Labour Party has to regroup and continue to modernize and blah blah blah blah blah. Now I honestly think if I had said At that time, do you know what? I think the next leader is sitting with us right here in this tent. I think how to be taken away and taken over to Saint Thomas'. And yet A few weeks later, he was the leader. It was it was incredible. It's the most unbelievable story. I don't think it's properly been told. Has somebody written a really good book about how he managed To do this because I think if for listeners who are interested in politics, to to take it back to it, this was a man who had never been considered Suitable for even the most junior shadow front bench position under any Labour administration had been put forward as a candidate Almost just because it was buggings' term for the far left of the Labour Party to rotate through different candidates and John McDonald had Didn't particularly want to do it. Didn't wanna do it. John McDonald had done it, I think, the time before or Diane Abbott done it time before, so they put him through. Got a couple of votes from more moderate figures who thought it was good for diversity to have Jeremy Corbyn on the race. Margaret Beckett, Sadiq Khan. Where are you now? Exactly. And then next thing we know, he wins. So So can you just tell us a little bit about how on earth did he manage to win from a position where nobody rated him to actually winning the whole thing? I think it was an underestimation of the extent to which the party had changed. And, you know, the party that we we'd had it in this era of pretty tight command and control, message discipline, so forth. Then we I think going through the crash, because the Labour Party did sort of at least come together behind it and really tried to go for it, And I think opened the door to the sense that we needed something a bit more radical. There is, by the way, a good book, and I've just Remember the name of it. It's it's called the it's Left Out, Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogreund, who now writes some pretty good stuff for the for the Sunday Times. Look. It's very hard to explain, but but I think also don't underestimate. We're back to this thing about and I'm not saying this is being critical of Corbyn, We were well into the populist era by then, and I think the sense of somebody going out and basically saying that you can have all this stuff that you want, you can we can make all this massive change. And we can do it without, you know, worrying too much about the detail. You know, he he was able in a way that I never thought we would be able to to galvanize an awful lot of young people to say, yeah. I wanna get behind this. It's it's amazing, isn't it? Because the candidates against him were Yvette Cooper Mhmm. Andy Burnham Yep. Who's been doing an amazing job in Chester, I really, you know, I I grumble about sleep calm, but I'm a great admirer of Andy Bannons and Liz Kendall, and you would have thought any one of those 3 would have been a very, very plausible candidate. I can't even remember who I voted for. He he apparently won by the largest mandate ever won by a party leader Yeah. With almost no support from his own MPs. Yeah. Owen Smith was a he challenged him in later than the end, and I did I did vote for him. But, no, you gotta hand it to Jeremy Corbyn. He's got something. And now there he is, You know, sort of probably thinking about whether he's gonna stand as an independent in in his LinkedIn. And and even very high profile figures, the history for independent candidates is not great. I've got one other shout out for the worst politician of the year. Yep. Neil Parish. Oh, Neil Parish, the poor man who was watching tractor porn on his, on his iPad. I mean, this is you said, we were just sort of think think talking about where we're at for a walk earlier, talking about all these things. All these things that have happened in 2022 that you've forgotten. And there'd be so the the Johnson era was just 1 after 1 ridiculous incident doing damage to our body politic. And, I think Neil Parish that was without a doubt the best excuse of misconduct or bad behavior I've ever heard. I was looking I was looking at subtractor websites, and for some reason, it led me to this pornographic site, and it popped up as I was sitting That's a compliment. It's also very sad, isn't it, because there was a there was a Labour MP who got in trouble when I was early in parliament. I'm not gonna humiliate him by mentioning him, but His excuse was, again, that he'd he'd again been found with some astonishing male pornography on his screen, and He he claimed he had no idea why Google had suggested this to him, but, of course, there is a reason why Google suggests this stuff, But we don't need to go to algorithms. Okay. Right. Moment of the year. Moment of the year. What was your moment of the year? I'm gonna stay in Latin America. I think my moment of the year was Bolsonaro losing. And the reason for that is that even though I have no massive connections with Brazil, if you remember the build up to that, There was all this talk about Bolsonaro wouldn't recognize the outcome if he'd lost, that there was the possibility of the military and the police getting involved against Lula if he won. And, actually, I hope this could be wishful thinking, but it's one of the reasons I am a little bit more optimistic about the state of the world than I was at the start of the year, Is Johnson's gone? And funnily enough, Johnson's departure didn't fill me with pleasure for some reason. I didn't I just felt so sick at the idea he'd ever been there. That Bolsonaro going, I felt, was potentially a really big turning point. And Trump apparently so far pretty much humiliating himself. I mean, not only now absolutely exposed for his illegal activity, but having really failed to move the dial on the midterms and Having really embarrassed himself in the last few weeks. The other politician who nearly got my foreign politician of the year award was Liz Cheney. Yep. I wrote down Liz Cheney. I would have talked about this Cheney. I'm a huge admirer of Liz Cheney's. Obviously, I am a great admirer of former conservatives who do the right thing and Break against their party leaders, but but I I I think Liz Cheney's been been very brave. On moment here, I think my moment of the year, to be very boring, has to be the invasion of Ukraine because it was something that changed 75 years of European history, And it's difficult to remember it was just this year that it happened, that it opened the floodgates to challenging the entire global trade system, destroyed global energy security, Wrecked our economies, raised the spectre of conflict with China, and moved the world, I think, from an age of populism to an age of global conflict. And I wonder, actually, whether that phenomenon you were talking about, which is some of the Short term fading of populism, so Trump humiliating himself, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss going, Bolsonaro going, may not Be connected to that, that maybe the specter of global conflict, hopefully unlike the way that it played in the 2nd World War where it seemed to reinforce Populist nationalism may in fact be driving in favor of slightly more moderate figures. And and and and serious politicians. And more serious politicians. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got I mean, Zelensky is has without a doubt. He was Time Magazine of the Year. Let's give a 3rd plug to the new European. He's the new European's European of the Year. Henry was saying this morning when we we were watching his speech in In congress, when you think of the the stress levels, I mean, I'm used to operating under quite severe stress levels, but the stress levels that he must be operating under off the charts. And yet he always seems to be able to come across as pretty authentic, pretty energetic, genuinely leading. It's wonderful, and I I there was a great tweet out from Dan Snow yesterday, historian, and he was responding to somebody who'd attacked Zelensky saying this man's an actor, he's turned up in Congress in his combat fatigues, and Dan Snow reminded asked that when Winston Churchill went to the United States, the early forties, he turned up in his sort of blitz boiler suit. And I think it's right. It's completely legitimate for a war leader to show through the clothes they wear But they are leading in a war, and that's what leadership is partly about. They're public figures. It also helps with, not having to put luggage in the hole. Just take hand baggage, which is as Very brilliant. And as you guys agreed, is is very important even if they send Air Force 1 for you. Exactly. Camouflage fatigues are also incredibly easy to wash and the hotel sinks. So I think that's a huge one. Now just wait one second because there's somebody at the door who you might want to say hello to. Oh, yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. It's it's gonna be a footballer. I'm warning you. It's gonna be a footballer. It's it's Lionel Messi is coming to the door. So he's coming in. It's meant to be Lionel Messi, but he hasn't turned up with Messi, and he hasn't turned up with Ronaldo either. No. I I don't think you want to see it for Messi. No Ronaldo. No. Not yet. It was a it was a florist. It was a florist. Oh, no. Sorry. Sorry. But we'll see. We'll see. Got Really excited about that. No no message. No message. Okay. So the surprise of the year, apart from the fact that when your doorbell went, it was the florist, My surprise to hear is, I guess, Europe's willingness to stand up to Russia despite the incredible cost to its economies And the incredible threat to its energy supply. That is not something that Vladimir Putin predicted and I would not have confidently predicted that The German chancellor would have stood up so strongly that that Europe would have stood up so strongly that UK and the US would have stood up so strongly. And that that Sweden and Finland would apply to join NATO. For which, a a shout out to Sanna Marin, the amazing Finnish dancing queen stroke producer. My surprise, Rory Yes. I will be absolutely frank about this. My surprise has been the success of this podcast. That's pretty surprising. I agree. If you think about it, it is only 9 months, 10 months since the Goldhanger team met me in the Preta Monge there, where you used to do prison pay negotiations, and said, did I think a podcast with Dominic Cummings would work? And I said, no. I don't think it would. Not very not for more than 1 episode. And then we got ahold of you, and and here we are top of the charts and flogging out the Albert Hall. It's very weird, isn't it? It's like I found I have found that genuinely pricing. I'm not saying I think it's surprising. And I it's surprising because I'm also sort of I mean, it's obviously some kind of odd couple dynamic, but I'm still Struggling to pin down exactly how the odd couple dynamic works, but I'm very, very pleased that people wanna listen to us. So please please keep listening. So there's a question there, Roy. The question is Cecily Spelling. What did you hope to achieve with the podcast this year besides lots of listeners, and what ambitions do you have for next year? I think we have managed to if I I've written about this in the in the book I've written for it's coming out later this next year, where I do think you have Slightly changed the manner in which I approach politics, and that's through us having this sort of motto of disagreeing Agreeably. I I can still be very combative. I can still lose my temper. I can still get very bit vituperative, but I've I've realized that, actually, It is better to have a a more consensual approach to some of these issues. Yeah. I think you've also been very good for me. I mean, I I I definitely have a tendency to go off on slightly pompous abstract digressions. I think you've been very good at roosting us. I think this is a good this is a good tense sign. Anyway, we stopped congratulating ourselves. What's your book of the year? We've got 1 fiction, 1 nonfiction. My nonfiction book And I think I read it this year, but it I I could be wrong, but it but it's one of the it's partly what inspired me to write the book that I'm writing, and it is our old friend, Moises' name, the revenge of power. I think I think it's the best, encapsulation of a lot of the stuff that we talk about about why our politics has gone as bad as it as it has. Very good. My, fiction book is, I'm going to show off my German here. I have read it in German, but it is available in English. And I didn't realize until I picked it up at German airport, but it's been out for a decade. And in German, it's, And the English translation is Look Who's Back by Timo Vermes, and it's this incredible book. And it's It is really it's very funny in parts. You feel a bit guilty about it being so funny because it's basically about Hitler, and, you know, we shouldn't really laugh about Hitler. Is it isn't there isn't there an amazing TV series on it? Been a film. Yeah. Film. Film. Yeah. Which is also called. And so, basically, just to give you the sort of brief of the story, Hitler wakes up in a rubbish lot, near the bunker, And he's got no memory or no knowledge of anything that's happened between 1945 and and and the Merkel era, which is when he he arrives. And he and, essentially, he goes around the place. Everybody recognizes who he is, but nobody believes him when he says he's Adolf Hitler. They think he's They think he's a comedian or he's a he's an actor, and he eventually ends up on a TV show. And there are there are some incredibly funny bits. The bit where he's He's trying to get an email address. Somebody's explaining to him about the Internet and the email is over, and he can't understand why he's not allowed just to call himself Adolf Hitler. And there's two reasons. 1 is that Adolf Hitler is a sort of a very bad lay, but also people have stolen every Adolf Hitler formulation going. So It's a kind of satire, but it does it does give you a sense of of why people Found him attractive as well, which I know is you could argue is is a bit dangerous. But, anyway, so that's my that's my novel of the year. That's good. Well, My books here, one of them, very old classic if anyone's got teenage children, but also, actually, I think it's a great book for adults to read, although it it is, to Some had said a young adult book, Ursula Le Guin, The Wizard of Earthsea trilogy, very, very strongly recommended. She was an amazing, child of an anthropologist, profound thinker from California, wrote very well about the Dao De Ching, the the Chinese, mystical text, but produced this wonderful, probably the best book ever written about wizards and dragons. So sorry. Is this is this this is nonfiction? This is the fiction one. Oh, this is the fiction one. Sorry. Fiction one. I thought you were talking about I I wonder whether you were going Tell me you also believe in UFO sightings. I also believe in dragons. Yeah. No. The a nonfiction one I was going to suggest, is by Raphael Bear. Mhmm. And who, we almost lost him, had a amazing, you know, he's younger than me and had a Terrible heart attack and almost died on a on a jog, but anyway, he came back from it and has written a book with the title, Politics A survivor's guide Mhmm. Which I've read the the the proof of, and you can preorder on now. Oh, it's not out yet? Not out yet, but it is preorder it, and It's a really, really thoughtful, interesting romp through his own history as a Jewish immigrant, His trips to Eastern Europe, his reporting in Moscow, and then his returning back to what he calls the perma crisis of Boris Johnson. So Rafael Baer, politics, the survivor's guide. It sounds like you're promoting what might be a little bit of a competitor to my book, really, and So I may have to take him down at some point. He's gloomier than you. You're you're the more optimistic one. Film of the year. Oh, film of the year. Yep. Well, I'm gonna say Elvis, which you recommended to me and I thought was absolutely wonderful. Over to you. I would say Elvis because I love saying Elvis, but I'm gonna go for Belfast, Kenneth Branagh. I absolutely I absolutely loved that film. I think it was this year. I certainly saw it this year. It is it is it really is a beautiful film. The young boy who plays, what, you know, you imagine to be a young Branagh, It's just so kind of warm and sort of lovable. And the the the parents have, you know, got there's a real sense of Authenticity about them and about their story, and it's not self indulgent. You get a real sense of what growing up during the troubles was like. And it also did I think I said at the time, it it it sort of fueled my anger at what this government is doing and is continuing to mess around with the, the peace process by not gripping, Brexit in the way that they should. I've I've been, Been watching Kenneth Branagh because the the Hamlet that I've been watching is Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. It's full length, 3 and a half out, and he's managed to persuade Charlton Heston To play the actor who does the play within the play, Mohammed. So that You're you're you're having some right or cultural experiences. Right. Right. All cultural experiences. Right. I think time for a cultural break. So welcome back to the Rest is Politics Awards ceremony with me, Rory Stewart. No. No. No. Rory, that wasn't good enough. So welcome back to the Restless Pro League's 2022 awards ceremony. With me, Rory Stewart and me, Alastair Campbell. The only person I've ever heard do that was Theresa May when she made me a minister did that sort of voice. It sounded a bit like being made a minister by Paul Daniels. She was like, Rory, I would like to make you the minister Of state in the department of international development. Like that. Listen. I heard a hilarious story about one of your appointments the other day. You can tell me if this is true. I met a guy who is now a press officer at the Labour Party, and he was a press officer at the prisons department. And he said that when you were prisons minister, you were so sort of Committed to your role as prisoners minister that you were trying out a new tag for prisoners, And they knew that you were about to be appointed to the cabinet by Theresa May because you were wearing your tag. Exactly. I was wearing an electronic tag, And they were able to monitor me right the way across the road into Downing Street on my electronic tech. And then, of course, as you know, when you get made a minister in your department, so I'd be made Sexually safe for international development. I then jumped in this fancy electric Jaguar and was driven over to the department for international development. With your tag? Still with my tag on, and, of course, Tags are designed for release participants not to be able to remove the tag, and the only way of getting the tag off was back in the Ministry of Justice. But I was now well into my working day in the department for industrial development, so I spent my 1st 2 days in the job with a with a tag on. So I'm glad I'm glad that was true. That proves that Labour Party press officers always tell the truth. Always. Always. Yeah. What's your personal highlight of the year, Alastair? It's a toss-up. They both involve swimming. The the one country I think I only went to 1 new country this year, and that was Cote d'ivoire. Which you loved. Which you really, really loved. And one of the swims I had there in this these incredible waves, with these guys who were playing music on the beach, and it was just absolutely beautiful. So that one, but probably the winner It was actually last week when I set a new personal low of swimming in 1 degree water. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. So I think that was my personal highlight. So just sort of quick one degree, there is Isonic, or there isn't Isonic? Not quite. You can see the beginnings of Icy. You can see the beginnings. Yeah. Not yeah. Yeah. So my highlight of the year, cheesily, is actually taking over as the president to give directly and reengaging with poverty in Africa because after I left politics, I, Went into a bit of a hibernation. I taught at Yale. I was a bit out of the swing of things, and it's been amazing to now be back And a proper job and to be able to travel properly in Africa and to take on a new team. We've got nearly a 1000 people, 12 country offices, but most of all, I think We do have a crack at making a dent in extreme poverty in our lifetime and I think cash transfer And the dignity it gives to people and the trust it gives to people. Very exciting, which is why I'm very keen, to try to invite you to come on a trip maybe with the pod to Malawi next year. Absolutely. Definitely. Definitely. That'd be great fun and, and interesting as well. Now what about speech of the year? Oh, speech of the year. I I I you know, I'm I I'm not really a big oh, actually, it's a bit it's a bit last year, but I often don't give him full credit. But probably the best parliamentary speech I heard was Tom Toogenhardt on the Afghan withdrawal, which was the most extraordinary 5, 6 minutes of Mhmm. Passion, anger, glimpses of humor, real oratory, and a very serious political point about The shamefulness of Britain's abandonment of Afghanistan. And, yeah, I should I should give him a bit of a shout out on that. Who's your speech there? Well, I'm gonna get a bit of grief here from all my Labour friends because my runner-up is Michael Heseltine, who did a brilliant speech about why we should never give up the fight to get back into the European Union. But my winner is a speech that John Major made, and the headline of the speech was in democracy we trust, question mark. And it was one of in a very majoresque, quite understated sort of way, it was the finest demolition of Johnson and the damage that he was doing to democracy. And I strongly recommend that people look it up and read the whole thing just to be reminded, because there's a real danger we forget of this sort of slow erosion of standards and the long term damage. I also owe you something because It's thanks to you that I've had another look at Tony Blair who I was deeply, deeply skeptical of and I was actually very impressed. I went to an event that he organised, Very impressed by his speech and his engagement with technology, his thoughtfulness about the future work. I think your doorbell's going, though. Is this Lionel Messi turning up to see you again? He's arrived. It might be Ronaldo. I don't know. Hold on. So we're we're waiting for Alastair to return. I'm looking at his bookshelf, and I'm looking at a door. There's some will be dreaming. There's some strange guest coming in. This person has even brought me a nice Christmas presents Beautiful. Bridget present. Bridget present. Bridget. But who is this? Because you're in the way of the camera. I can't see the person. At the moment. You'd have to put an ear you'd have to put an earphone. You're not seriously in It's it's just being filmed. This is it's David Miliband leaning at Alastair's feet. It's absolutely extraordinary. David, hello. David Miliband is playing Santa. I brought Alastair his, Christmas I'm sorry. And Fiona, but it's slightly Alastair focused. Two Christmas presents. Oh, Dave, we're very, very excited to have you. And he he he talks you up a lot, so I wasn't quite sure whether you were gonna be one of the most famous footballers in the world or I said I said Lionel Messi was gonna Oh my god. I'm I feel like I've disappointed you. As always, I feel disappointed. This This is making me feel like I'm very close to kissing you. Can you put this in the other ear? I put my yeah. Like that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Actually, we Alastair and I were being photographed. We got very close to kissing each other. We all made our photographs almost nose to nose. What? The Royal Albert Hall in front of 5,500 people? Yeah. It was very disturbing. David, Quick question for you. We're doing our events of the year, and somebody called Emily O'Brien's written it, and I'm gonna give you a second because it's not unfair to you. I'm gonna get Alastair to answer first. Mistake of the year in politics and personally. We'll give you a bit of time. I'm gonna let Alastair think about it while you think about mistake of the year. Do you mean being our own mistakes or other people's I think a A mistake someone else's mistake in politics. Trust QuaTing, without a doubt. That was pretty colossal, wasn't it? The 2nd award for trust in QuaTing. In the in the in the demerits of the year? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. John, then I think the mistake of the year was Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This was a bad year for dictators In various ways, it was a very bad year for people around the world in some in extreme circumstances, but I think Putin's invasion will go down as Grand historical error on Napoleonic scale. I think David Miliband's mistake of the year is kneeling down at my I'm not at your feet. I'm at exactly, I've got this rather difficult, thing, but I want you to, open the present because the The the tree's motif has got He's opening a present just for those of you who are listening to this. Oh, you can listen to the look. What's he giving you? How to be more tree. Now just ex with the I'm very old. Look at it. Don't don't don't don't do what children do and throw the book present away before you've looked at it. Great trees of New York map. Oh, was he expecting a Pokemon or something, and now he's really disappointed? But look look the the thing is it tells you how this now, I'm afraid, just in case you are suffering from low self esteem, this will show that, Actually, your obsession with trees is quite well It is. Grounded. Look at what the chapter life lessons for perennial happiness. I've always believed trees can make you happy. No. The the trees don't the trees have figured out how to be happy. Look at the chapter headings. Okay. Beginnings are always small. Japanese maple tree. Patience in the Vertu. I've heard that one. Draw strength from our draw strength from our husband, Alastair. The where where do you get with the patience? There's a virtue one, Alastair, then. Ask for help when you need it. The Elm tree does that. It's fabulous. Environment. The American nation beach. Be authentic. Hornby. Hornby. Always have a plan b. Not for what's your plan b, David? Plan I'm on to plan n by now, I think, rather than plan b. Thank you very much. Is this are you podcasting in, the questions Podcast was just a domain. Awards. We're doing a special award. Special award ceremony. Yeah. How many have you won for yourselves? Hasn't won it. Well, the podcast was the the success of the podcast was the surprise. David, I I want you to have a chance to talk properly to Anastar, but can we just quickly just do the last bits on this pod? No. David's not staying. He's going. He's I'm I'm not. Well, he's got very important people to see. Well, let's do event Event of the year, sport. Event of the year, culture. And then let you have 5 minutes chat to David. So, Gun, what's what's your event of the year, sport? What's your event of the year, culture? In sport. Well, you'd have to say the World Cup, I I think. But the I think there's English cricket English cricket has been amazing this year. Mhmm. Amazing. Just extraordinary. I have to say, I think Burnley be absolutely destroying Blackburn Rovers was up there. I do think Ben Stokes should have been Sports Personality I know it was fantastic. You wouldn't run the football, and Beth Reid is a great footballer. But the bench what Ben Stowe has done this year has been extraordinary. My cultural event of the year Mhmm. Yep. It's Abba Voyage. Oh, yeah. That's And if you haven't seen it, go and see it. I know but it also has a political connotation to this because it did it did make me worry about the potential for deep fake. Because you because you you really thought you were watching ABBA even though you were sitting next to ABBA. You were watching the 4 members of ABBA perform live. It was incredible. Despite the fact they were sitting next to you. So Michael Chandler, yeah, just to remind of all the things that have happened this year is the queen's funeral. It's extraordinary that this year has seen so much. The Boris Johnson mistrust, car crashes, Donald Trump temporarily imploding, Putin's version of Ukraine, but the queen's queen's funeral Queen's funeral. The death of the queen, I think, has been a massive epochal event for Britain. Perhaps also worth mentioning as a as a great cultural event, the list of trust curtsy. Perhaps perhaps we should just abolish the whole curtsy thing, Rory. What do you think? I think the curtsy thing is Does Rory curtsy to you when he comes into the podcast? I don't think he curtsies to me, but I suspect he does curtsy when he meets Camilla. Well, at at the moment, I noticed David's actually kneeling to you, which I've never actually done. Yes. That you can't see me below my midriff or above my sort of My chin. Below my chin. I think we should let David stay because the other thing we're doing is a lifetime achievement award. Oh, okay. Now we've only decided who this is because it's the only one we had to agree on. Mhmm. And we've agreed to agree that our the first ever Rest is Politics Lifetime achievement award goes to Neil and Glynis Kinnock. Wow. That was very nice. Neil because of his role in paving the way. And Glenys Glenys, who's head of a great public career, but also has been struggling a little bit with dementia. Yep. About which they're now talking openly as a way of trying to raise awareness and better service, etcetera. Of course, Glenys worked for you at the was A minister in the foreign office, very lucky for me. She was extraordinarily committed. She had this Real experience, from the European Parliament on the worksheet done in Africa. Neil was actually the chairman of the British Council when we appointed Glenys as the minister, and he then felt he had to resign Yeah. From the British Council to avoid any suggestions Shay. Reminds you. Can you imagine any of this Honestly, I I it hadn't really occurred to anyone that there was a reason for him to there was no reason for him to resign. But he he immediately said, I think it's fantastic that Glenys is being made a minister. She was briefly minister for Europe and then went became minister for Africa. He said I can't carry on in this role because you know what it'll be like. People will say that something will come up and people will say that It wasn't right, so he resigned, which and he'd done an amazing job. He'd been 4 or 5 years as the chairman of the British Council. Oh, well, that's I think that's a very good thing to end on, and we're gonna let Alastair and David, chat for a few minutes. And thank you all so much for listening to The Restless Politics special events. No, Roy. You've gotta do better than that. Thank you so much for joining us at the rest is politics awards for 2022. See you next year. That's how you See you next year.",

To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show tickets. Just go to the rest is politics.com. That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nWell, welcome to The Rest is Politics Awards with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And me, Rory Stewart. And this, I I'm gonna I'll just give you a bit of credit for this, the awards. So I'm gonna be guided by you a little bit through the system.\n\nSpeaker 0: So what we've done, Roel, why we we've just worked out a few categories, and each of us have to to pick, a person, an event, whatever it might be, To fit these categories, outstanding, politicians, event of the year, surprise of the year, moment of the year, film of the year, all sorts of things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it is it all about the World Cup, Or there's some other stuff\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm gonna try and get through without even mentioning the World Cup. Oh. Because unlike you, I'm just not obsessed with football. I'm just not a massive football fan of you. And then at the end, we're going to have a lifetime achievement award.\n\nBut on that one, we have to agree. On all the others, we don't have to agree. We can say what we like. So the first one is outstanding British politician of the year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gosh. Well, as a starter for 10 then, maybe the big theme of the end of the year is the way in which We have moved a little bit away, I guess, from the extremes of populism of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. And in their different ways, Keir Starmer and the Labour Party Has, I think, completed the transition away from Jeremy Corbyn, made them a really serious electable party, you You know, many, many points ahead. I know what they are. 20, 30 points ahead on the polls at the moment.\n\nAnd Rishi Sunak has, for for all the grumbles we've done on the show, Definitely, compared to Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, brought a bit more sort of sanity and restraint back to the conservative party. So\n\nSpeaker 0: So So in your in your classic establishment way, Rory, you're going for the leaders. You go for the 2 leaders of the 2 main parties. I'm going to the backbenches.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, go on, man.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I'm also going to the Tory backbenches.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go on.\n\nSpeaker 0: And my 2022 politician of the year is Charles Walker.\n\nSpeaker 1: Charles Walker. Sir Charles Walker. Go and tell us about him then.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, the reason I like I've I've always liked Charles Walker because he was one of the 1st MPs of any party to come out openly and say that he had mental health problems, that he'd struggled all his life with OCD. But I think the reason he's impressed me this year In a pretty unimpressive parliament, it has to be said, is he has genuine this is a guy who's never been in ministry. He's been an MP for 20 odd years. He's never been a minister. But he has genuinely spoken truth to power with real passion and conviction.\n\nHe did it to Johnson when Johnson was falling apart. He was one of the first people to Called on Trust to Go said she was an absolute disgrace and a shambles, that she couldn't he couldn't imagine why anybody would would vote for her. And I think I remember as well when During the COVID, period, when he was he seemed to me you had all these kind of anti vaxxers who were really, really irritating, but he just had a passionate snip to kind of view that we were doing massive mental health damage by locking people up for so long. We weren't thinking through the consequences. So I'm going for Charles Walker.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's that's great. So I I I always liked him very much. I mean, he's incredibly so he's the stepson of an MP. He's he's sort of the kind of guy who I thought would be Almost a kind of pinup conservative MP of the 19 fifties. He's very kinda good looking, very charming, but as you say, has very much been a professional backbencher.\n\nHe's a big Stalwart of the 1922 committee, which was this it's the backbench kind of engine room of the conservative party. He could be very funny in the House of Commons. He'd make these I I once saw him make a speech that I think was about 4 words long.\n\nSpeaker 0: If not now, when?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, very good. Oh, goodness gracious me. Although, yeah, you actually knew that?\n\nSpeaker 0: That was the that was true. Money, that was him calling for a referendum, so I didn't like him for that.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Although, yeah, I noticed in the new European, which we sometimes promote a little bit on the show\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: He gave an interview in 2019 saying, Brexiteer MP, colon, I was an idiot to ever think a referendum was a good idea.\n\nSpeaker 0: I like him even better.\n\nSpeaker 1: So one of the nice things is he's he's quite he's quite good unlike most MPs that Sort of contradicting himself. He says, I'm an idiot. I'm happy to admit to your listeners I'm an idiot.\n\nSpeaker 0: So So there we are. That's the 1st award. Outstanding UK politicians are Charles Walker from me and Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak from Rory. Now outstanding overseas politician of the year. And I guess this was just really boring, isn't it?\n\nBecause this one this one, such an obvious choice Currently at Washington.\n\nSpeaker 1: I know. But we gotta avoid him. We're not not allowed to say we're not allowed not allowed to say Zelensky if that's what we've got.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think we probably I think we should probably say Zelensky, but here's a great question from Alex Skitt. Outside of Zelensky and Putin, if you could pick 1 hero and 1 villain of 2022, Who would it be and why? And I think I'm gonna go for Joe Biden. I think Joe Biden has just been extraordinary this year. I mean, yes, he's very old, and, yes, he looks A bit doddery at times, and he gets his words all bottled up.\n\nBut I think, you know, we've seen it just in recent days with Zelensky in Washington. For all that Johnson tried to take the credit on Ukraine, Biden has really showed incredible global leadership on Ukraine. He's done some pretty remarkable things on the domestic front. And he's just a very, very nice bloke.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's extraordinary, isn't it? I mean, I'm I'm in the US at the moment, and The last acts of this Democratic Party dominated Senate congress is gonna be to vote through another very, very large package of support for Ukraine, But there's an extraordinary dissonance because you're absolutely right. Objectively, he's got through this big stimulus package, One of the biggest environment climate packages ever passed in the United States, probably the biggest, he's done very well in Ukraine, but on the other hand, Everybody that I talk to in Washington who works closely with him literally says it's like the end of the film of El Cid. He's like this He's this dead corpse being put on a horse and ridden out. So there's this sort of weird discrepancy between the sense of him being very Apparently, in public, decrepit, and forgetful, while at the same time getting these amazing things done.\n\nI'd like a shout out, though, too, to your friend Macron. I know he embarrassed himself a little bit, I thought, on the on the World Cup pitch. There we are. I got World Cup reference in.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're obsessed, or are you obsessed?\n\nSpeaker 1: He did he did succeed in seeing off, Le Pen in the elections.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: We obviously had a major criticism last week of him, which is the way in which he's got in the way of blocking a lot of the accession of countries like Bosnia and Serbia to the EU, which was a very important part of what was drawing people into peace in the Balkans. But all that aside, I think he is a genuinely Extraordinary figure. I mean, it's incredible how he's reinvented French politics, how he's shown that being an independent could work, how he reshaped the entire party system. I mean, I think If great politicians are creative people who create new circumstances, Macron certainly seems to have done that.\n\nSpeaker 0: And so if we're not allowed Putin as the as the worst foreign politician of the year, I think we probably agreed that he is, but if we're not allowed him, I think I'm gonna go for Lukashenko, his poodle in Belarus. In fact, I one of the, more interesting things I did this week this year rather was the contact I had with the Belarus opposition who are some pretty, you know, fantastic people who are doing some very, very brave things. And in fact, you mentioned the new European. Let's give them another plug. They did a big piece that we got the opposition to do a big piece, and it was all about Putin's poodle and, and so forth.\n\nBut, you know, Lukashenko is one of the few last standing enablers. I guess Xi is to some extent in that Xi could, you know, he could push harder against him, but I'm I'm going for Lukashenko as Putin's sidekick.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I in 2003 when I just finished in Iraq sorry, 2005, just finished in Iraq and I was looking for a new job in the foreign office And somebody tried to, encourage me to apply to be the ambassador in Belarus and said, it's a great opportunity, 2005. Lukashenko's on his way out. This is the last dictatorship on the edge of the European Union. You need to get in there as the ambassador in 2005, and you'll have an amazing 3 years bringing Belarus Into the fold of the European Union and spreading democracy to the edge of Russia.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're not tempted.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here we are 17 years later. I might have\n\nSpeaker 2: That that that would have been a\n\nSpeaker 0: good job. You don't know. You might have made a difference. So what about domestic domestic worst politician of the year? I suppose Johnson and Truss are runaway winners.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I must say Liz Truss was pretty astonishing. I mean, she doesn't I mean, Boris Johnson, you know, As I keep saying, he's the most monstrous human being but has a certain kind of political skill. I mean, he he Won elections. He almost got himself back in again, voted in by the Conservative MPs. He's standing against a great survivor.\n\nLiz Truss, I mean, I cannot think of a more catastrophic period, sadly, as prime minister for 200 or 300 years. I mean, it broke records in every way as well as breaking the The British economy. On the international side, though, a a little shout out for Pedro Castillo, who's who, although he lasted a bit longer than Liz Truss, is a pretty Astonishing combination of both being pretty uninspiring, this is the president of Peru, ex president of Peru, pretty uninspiring individual, not great Intellectual skills and development, but also managed to culminate in trying to do a massive Anti constitutional coup d'etat, full on populism trying to dissolve his own legislature and has ended up, as you pointed out last week, in jail.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But you say he's not inspiring, but he is partly inspiring from jail these people to go out and fight on the streets, and it's really it's leading us rather a lot of bloodshed.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's true. That's true. I mean, he's a full on left wing populist. I mean, I think he's and I was thinking about this also with Jeremy Corbyn, who's been popping up a bit on Twitter in the last, last couple of weeks, holding forth on the World Cup, hold holding forth on Palestine and the normal Germany competition.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which we all wholly thought that the World Cup is exclusively your preserve.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Exactly. Jeremy Corbyn and I are competing for who is more expert on the subject of football. But It is extraordinary thinking back to 2017 and the fact that he could pack Glastonbury and have the entire crowd Chanting, oh oh, Jeremy Corbyn. I mean, it's it's, it it is extraordinary and how somebody who I, certainly, when I entered politics in 2010, Was a joke.\n\nI mean, I remember the Labour front bench, when he spoke, would all sort of turn around and laugh, and people would walk out of the chamber when he'd try Speak and\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Artie Artie Roy, when on the day that David Cameron won the election against Ed Miliband, And I've been helping Ed a bit during the campaign, and I was down at, Labour Party headquarters, and they asked me to go and do the media round down on College Green. And I was due to do Radio 5 with Peter Allen, Radio 5 live. And I was went over to the tent, and they said, oh, Jeremy Corbyn's in there, at the moment doing an interview. Would you mind doing it together? And I said, well, I don't mind, but, you know, you better ask him.\n\nAnd so he didn't mind. So we ended up doing this interview together where I was saying that, you You know, just saying nice things about aired, but then saying the Labour Party has to regroup and continue to modernize and blah blah blah blah blah. Now I honestly think if I had said At that time, do you know what? I think the next leader is sitting with us right here in this tent. I think how to be taken away and taken over to Saint Thomas'.\n\nAnd yet A few weeks later, he was the leader. It was it was incredible.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the most unbelievable story. I don't think it's properly been told. Has somebody written a really good book about how he managed To do this because I think if for listeners who are interested in politics, to to take it back to it, this was a man who had never been considered Suitable for even the most junior shadow front bench position under any Labour administration had been put forward as a candidate Almost just because it was buggings' term for the far left of the Labour Party to rotate through different candidates and John McDonald had\n\nSpeaker 0: Didn't particularly want to do it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Didn't wanna do it. John McDonald had done it, I think, the time before or Diane Abbott done it time before, so they put him through. Got a couple of votes from more moderate figures who thought it was good for diversity to have Jeremy Corbyn on the\n\nSpeaker 0: race. Margaret Beckett, Sadiq Khan. Where are you now?\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. And then next thing we know, he wins. So So can you just tell us a little bit about how on earth did he manage to win from a position where nobody rated him to actually winning the whole thing?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think it was an underestimation of the extent to which the party had changed. And, you know, the party that we we'd had it in this era of pretty tight command and control, message discipline, so forth. Then we I think going through the crash, because the Labour Party did sort of at least come together behind it and really tried to go for it, And I think opened the door to the sense that we needed something a bit more radical. There is, by the way, a good book, and I've just Remember the name of it. It's it's called the it's Left Out, Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogreund, who now writes some pretty good stuff for the for the Sunday Times.\n\nLook. It's very hard to explain, but but I think also don't underestimate. We're back to this thing about and I'm not saying this is being critical of Corbyn, We were well into the populist era by then, and I think the sense of somebody going out and basically saying that you can have all this stuff that you want, you can we can make all this massive change. And we can do it without, you know, worrying too much about the detail. You know, he he was able in a way that I never thought we would be able to to galvanize an awful lot of young people to say, yeah.\n\nI wanna get behind this.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's amazing, isn't it? Because the candidates against him were Yvette Cooper Mhmm. Andy Burnham Yep. Who's been doing an amazing job in Chester, I really, you know, I I grumble about sleep calm, but I'm a great admirer of Andy Bannons and Liz Kendall, and you would have thought any one of those 3 would have been a very, very plausible candidate.\n\nSpeaker 0: I can't even remember who I voted for.\n\nSpeaker 1: He he apparently won by the largest mandate ever won by a party leader\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: With almost no support from his own MPs.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Owen Smith was a he challenged him in later than the end, and I did I did vote for him. But, no, you gotta hand it to Jeremy Corbyn. He's got something. And now there he is, You know, sort of probably thinking about whether he's gonna stand as an independent in in his LinkedIn.\n\nAnd and even very high profile figures, the history for independent candidates is not great. I've got one other shout out for the worst politician of the year. Yep. Neil Parish.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, Neil Parish, the poor man who was watching tractor porn on his, on his iPad.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, this is you said, we were just sort of think think talking about where we're at for a walk earlier, talking about all these things. All these things that have happened in 2022 that you've forgotten. And there'd be so the the Johnson era was just 1 after 1 ridiculous incident doing damage to our body politic. And, I think Neil Parish that was without a doubt the best excuse of misconduct or bad behavior I've ever heard. I was looking I was looking at subtractor websites, and for some reason, it led me to this pornographic site, and it popped up as I was sitting That's a compliment.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's also very sad, isn't it, because there was a there was a Labour MP who got in trouble when I was early in parliament. I'm not gonna humiliate him by mentioning him, but His excuse was, again, that he'd he'd again been found with some astonishing male pornography on his screen, and He he claimed he had no idea why Google had suggested this to him, but, of course, there is a reason why Google suggests this stuff, But we don't need to go to algorithms. Okay. Right. Moment of the year.\n\nMoment of the year. What was your\n\nSpeaker 0: moment of the year? I'm gonna stay in Latin America. I think my moment of the year was Bolsonaro losing. And the reason for that is that even though I have no massive connections with Brazil, if you remember the build up to that, There was all this talk about Bolsonaro wouldn't recognize the outcome if he'd lost, that there was the possibility of the military and the police getting involved against Lula if he won. And, actually, I hope this could be wishful thinking, but it's one of the reasons I am a little bit more optimistic about the state of the world than I was at the start of the year, Is Johnson's gone?\n\nAnd funnily enough, Johnson's departure didn't fill me with pleasure for some reason. I didn't I just felt so sick at the idea he'd ever been there. That Bolsonaro going, I felt, was potentially a really big turning point.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Trump apparently so far pretty much humiliating himself. I mean, not only now absolutely exposed for his illegal activity, but having really failed to move the dial on the midterms and Having really embarrassed himself in the last few weeks.\n\nSpeaker 0: The other politician who nearly got my foreign politician of the year award was Liz Cheney.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. I wrote down Liz Cheney. I would have talked about this Cheney. I'm a huge admirer of Liz Cheney's. Obviously, I am a great admirer of former conservatives who do the right thing and Break against their party leaders, but but I I I think Liz Cheney's been been very brave.\n\nOn moment here, I think my moment of the year, to be very boring, has to be the invasion of Ukraine because it was something that changed 75 years of European history, And it's difficult to remember it was just this year that it happened, that it opened the floodgates to challenging the entire global trade system, destroyed global energy security, Wrecked our economies, raised the spectre of conflict with China, and moved the world, I think, from an age of populism to an age of global conflict. And I wonder, actually, whether that phenomenon you were talking about, which is some of the Short term fading of populism, so Trump humiliating himself, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss going, Bolsonaro going, may not Be connected to that, that maybe the specter of global conflict, hopefully unlike the way that it played in the 2nd World War where it seemed to reinforce Populist nationalism may in fact be driving in favor of slightly more moderate figures.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and and and serious politicians.\n\nSpeaker 1: And more serious politicians. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. I've got I mean, Zelensky is has without a doubt. He was Time Magazine of the Year. Let's give a 3rd plug to the new European.\n\nHe's the new European's European of the Year. Henry was saying this morning when we we were watching his speech in In congress, when you think of the the stress levels, I mean, I'm used to operating under quite severe stress levels, but the stress levels that he must be operating under off the charts. And yet he always seems to be able to come across as pretty authentic, pretty energetic, genuinely leading.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's wonderful, and I I there was a great tweet out from Dan Snow yesterday, historian, and he was responding to somebody who'd attacked Zelensky saying this man's an actor, he's turned up in Congress in his combat fatigues, and Dan Snow reminded asked that when Winston Churchill went to the United States, the early forties, he turned up in his sort of blitz boiler suit. And I think it's right. It's completely legitimate for a war leader to show through the clothes they wear But they are leading in a war, and that's what leadership is partly about. They're public figures.\n\nSpeaker 0: It also helps with, not having to put luggage in the hole. Just take hand baggage, which is\n\nSpeaker 1: as Very brilliant. And\n\nSpeaker 0: as you guys agreed, is is very important even if they send Air Force 1 for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Camouflage fatigues are also incredibly easy to wash and the hotel sinks. So I think that's a huge one.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now just wait one second because there's somebody at the door who you might want to say hello to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good.\n\nIt's it's gonna be a footballer. I'm warning you. It's gonna be a footballer. It's it's Lionel Messi is coming to the door. So he's coming in.\n\nIt's meant to be Lionel Messi, but he hasn't turned up with Messi, and he hasn't turned up with Ronaldo either.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I I don't think you want to\n\nSpeaker 1: see it for Messi. No Ronaldo.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Not yet. It was a it was a florist.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was a florist. Oh, no. Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sorry. But we'll see. We'll see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got Really excited about that.\n\nSpeaker 0: No no message. No message.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So the surprise of the year, apart from the fact that when your doorbell went, it was the florist, My surprise to hear is, I guess, Europe's willingness to stand up to Russia despite the incredible cost to its economies And the incredible threat to its energy supply. That is not something that Vladimir Putin predicted and I would not have confidently predicted that The German chancellor would have stood up so strongly that that Europe would have stood up so strongly that UK and the US would have stood up so strongly.\n\nSpeaker 0: And that that Sweden and Finland would apply to join NATO.\n\nSpeaker 1: For which, a a shout out to Sanna Marin, the amazing Finnish dancing queen stroke producer.\n\nSpeaker 0: My surprise, Rory\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I will\n\nSpeaker 0: be absolutely frank about this. My surprise has been the success of this podcast.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's pretty surprising. I agree.\n\nSpeaker 0: If you think about it, it is only 9 months, 10 months since the Goldhanger team met me in the Preta Monge there, where you used to do prison pay negotiations, and said, did I think a podcast with Dominic Cummings would work? And I said, no. I don't think it would. Not very not for more than 1 episode. And then we got ahold of you, and and here we are top of the charts and flogging out the Albert Hall.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's very weird, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: It's like I found I have found that genuinely pricing. I'm not saying I\n\nSpeaker 1: think it's surprising. And I it's surprising because I'm also sort of I mean, it's obviously some kind of odd couple dynamic, but I'm still Struggling to pin down exactly how the odd couple dynamic works, but I'm very, very pleased that people wanna listen to us. So please please keep listening.\n\nSpeaker 0: So there's a question there, Roy. The question is Cecily Spelling. What did you hope to achieve with the podcast this year besides lots of listeners, and what ambitions do you have for next year? I think we have managed to if I I've written about this in the in the book I've written for it's coming out later this next year, where I do think you have Slightly changed the manner in which I approach politics, and that's through us having this sort of motto of disagreeing Agreeably. I I can still be very combative.\n\nI can still lose my temper. I can still get very bit vituperative, but I've I've realized that, actually, It is better to have a a more consensual approach to some of these issues.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think you've also been very good for me. I mean, I I I definitely have a tendency to go off on slightly pompous abstract digressions. I think you've been very good at roosting us. I think this is a good this is a good tense sign.\n\nAnyway, we stopped congratulating ourselves. What's your book of the year?\n\nSpeaker 0: We've got 1 fiction, 1 nonfiction. My nonfiction book And I think I read it this year, but it I I could be wrong, but it but it's one of the it's partly what inspired me to write the book that I'm writing, and it is our old friend, Moises' name, the revenge of power. I think I think it's the best, encapsulation of a lot of the stuff that we talk about about why our politics has gone as bad as it as it has.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: My, fiction book is, I'm going to show off my German here. I have read it in German, but it is available in English. And I didn't realize until I picked it up at German airport, but it's been out for a decade. And in German, it's, And the English translation is Look Who's Back by Timo Vermes, and it's this incredible book. And it's It is really it's very funny in parts.\n\nYou feel a bit guilty about it being so funny because it's basically about Hitler, and, you know, we shouldn't really laugh about Hitler. Is\n\nSpeaker 1: it isn't there isn't there an amazing TV series on it?\n\nSpeaker 0: Been a film.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Film. Film. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which is also called. And so, basically, just to give you the sort of brief of the story, Hitler wakes up in a rubbish lot, near the bunker, And he's got no memory or no knowledge of anything that's happened between 1945 and and and the Merkel era, which is when he he arrives. And he and, essentially, he goes around the place. Everybody recognizes who he is, but nobody believes him when he says he's Adolf Hitler. They think he's They think he's a comedian or he's a he's an actor, and he eventually ends up on a TV show.\n\nAnd there are there are some incredibly funny bits. The bit where he's He's trying to get an email address. Somebody's explaining to him about the Internet and the email is over, and he can't understand why he's not allowed just to call himself Adolf Hitler. And there's two reasons. 1 is that Adolf Hitler is a sort of a very bad lay, but also people have stolen every Adolf Hitler formulation going.\n\nSo It's a kind of satire, but it does it does give you a sense of of why people Found him attractive as well, which I know is you could argue is is a bit dangerous. But, anyway, so that's my that's my novel of the year.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good. Well, My books here, one of them, very old classic if anyone's got teenage children, but also, actually, I think it's a great book for adults to read, although it it is, to Some had said a young adult book, Ursula Le Guin, The Wizard of Earthsea trilogy, very, very strongly recommended. She was an amazing, child of an anthropologist, profound thinker from California, wrote very well about the Dao De Ching, the the Chinese, mystical text, but produced this wonderful, probably the best book ever written about wizards and dragons.\n\nSpeaker 0: So sorry. Is this is this this is nonfiction?\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the fiction one.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, this\n\nSpeaker 1: is the fiction one. Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: Fiction one.\n\nSpeaker 1: I thought you\n\nSpeaker 0: were talking about I I wonder whether you were going Tell me you also believe in UFO sightings.\n\nSpeaker 1: I also believe in dragons. Yeah. No. The a nonfiction one I was going to suggest, is by Raphael Bear. Mhmm.\n\nAnd who, we almost lost him, had a amazing, you know, he's younger than me and had a Terrible heart attack and almost died on a on a jog, but anyway, he came back from it and has written a book with the title, Politics A survivor's guide Mhmm. Which I've read the the the proof of, and you can preorder on now.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, it's not out yet?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not out yet, but it is preorder it, and It's a really, really thoughtful, interesting romp through his own history as a Jewish immigrant, His trips to Eastern Europe, his reporting in Moscow, and then his returning back to what he calls the perma crisis of Boris Johnson. So Rafael Baer, politics, the survivor's guide.\n\nSpeaker 0: It sounds like you're promoting what might be a little bit of a competitor to my book, really, and So I may have to take him down at some point.\n\nSpeaker 1: He's gloomier than you. You're you're the more optimistic one.\n\nSpeaker 0: Film of the year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, film of the year. Yep. Well, I'm gonna say Elvis, which you recommended to me and I thought was absolutely wonderful. Over to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: I would say Elvis because I love saying Elvis, but I'm gonna go for Belfast, Kenneth Branagh. I absolutely I absolutely loved that film. I think it was this year. I certainly saw it this year. It is it is it really is a beautiful film.\n\nThe young boy who plays, what, you know, you imagine to be a young Branagh, It's just so kind of warm and sort of lovable. And the the the parents have, you know, got there's a real sense of Authenticity about them and about their story, and it's not self indulgent. You get a real sense of what growing up during the troubles was like. And it also did I think I said at the time, it it it sort of fueled my anger at what this government is doing and is continuing to mess around with the, the peace process by not gripping, Brexit in the way that they should.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've I've been, Been watching Kenneth Branagh because the the Hamlet that I've been watching is Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet. It's full length, 3 and a half out, and he's managed to persuade Charlton Heston To play the actor who does the play within the play, Mohammed. So that\n\nSpeaker 0: You're you're you're having some right or cultural experiences.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. Right. All cultural experiences. Right. I think time for a cultural break.\n\nSo welcome back to the Rest is Politics Awards ceremony with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. No. Rory, that wasn't good enough. So welcome back to the Restless Pro League's 2022 awards ceremony.\n\nWith me, Rory Stewart and me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: The only person I've ever heard do that was Theresa May when she made me a minister did that sort of voice. It sounded a bit like being made a minister by Paul Daniels. She was like, Rory, I would like to make you the minister Of state in the department of international development. Like that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Listen. I heard a hilarious story about one of your appointments the other day. You can tell me if this is true. I met a guy who is now a press officer at the Labour Party, and he was a press officer at the prisons department. And he said that when you were prisons minister, you were so sort of Committed to your role as prisoners minister that you were trying out a new tag for prisoners, And they knew that you were about to be appointed to the cabinet by Theresa May because you were wearing your tag.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. I was wearing an electronic tag, And they were able to monitor me right the way across the road into Downing Street on my electronic tech. And then, of course, as you know, when you get made a minister in your department, so I'd be made Sexually safe for international development. I then jumped in this fancy electric Jaguar and was driven over to the department for international development.\n\nSpeaker 0: With your tag?\n\nSpeaker 1: Still with my tag on, and, of course, Tags are designed for release participants not to be able to remove the tag, and the only way of getting the tag off was back in the Ministry of Justice. But I was now well into my working day in the department for industrial development, so I spent my 1st 2 days in the job with a with a tag on.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I'm glad I'm glad that was true. That proves that Labour Party press officers always tell the truth.\n\nSpeaker 1: Always. Always. Yeah. What's your personal highlight of the year, Alastair?\n\nSpeaker 0: It's a toss-up. They both involve swimming. The the one country I think I only went to 1 new country this year, and that was Cote d'ivoire.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which you loved. Which you really, really\n\nSpeaker 0: loved. And one of the swims I had there in this these incredible waves, with these guys who were playing music on the beach, and it was just absolutely beautiful. So that one, but probably the winner It was actually last week when I set a new personal low of swimming in 1 degree water.\n\nSpeaker 1: Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.\n\nSpeaker 0: Ow. So I think that was my personal highlight.\n\nSpeaker 1: So just sort of quick one degree, there is Isonic, or there isn't Isonic?\n\nSpeaker 0: Not quite. You can see the beginnings of Icy.\n\nSpeaker 1: You can see the beginnings. Yeah. Not yeah. Yeah. So my highlight of the year, cheesily, is actually taking over as the president to give directly and reengaging with poverty in Africa because after I left politics, I, Went into a bit of a hibernation.\n\nI taught at Yale. I was a bit out of the swing of things, and it's been amazing to now be back And a proper job and to be able to travel properly in Africa and to take on a new team. We've got nearly a 1000 people, 12 country offices, but most of all, I think We do have a crack at making a dent in extreme poverty in our lifetime and I think cash transfer And the dignity it gives to people and the trust it gives to people. Very exciting, which is why I'm very keen, to try to invite you to come on a trip maybe with the pod to Malawi next year.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Definitely. Definitely. That'd be great fun and, and interesting as well. Now what about speech of the year?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, speech of the year. I I I you know, I'm I I'm not really a big oh, actually, it's a bit it's a bit last year, but I often don't give him full credit. But probably the best parliamentary speech I heard was Tom Toogenhardt on the Afghan withdrawal, which was the most extraordinary 5, 6 minutes of Mhmm. Passion, anger, glimpses of humor, real oratory, and a very serious political point about The shamefulness of Britain's abandonment of Afghanistan. And, yeah, I should I should give him a bit of a shout out on that.\n\nWho's your speech there?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'm gonna get a bit of grief here from all my Labour friends because my runner-up is Michael Heseltine, who did a brilliant speech about why we should never give up the fight to get back into the European Union. But my winner is a speech that John Major made, and the headline of the speech was in democracy we trust, question mark. And it was one of in a very majoresque, quite understated sort of way, it was the finest demolition of Johnson and the damage that he was doing to democracy. And I strongly recommend that people look it up and read the whole thing just to be reminded, because there's a real danger we forget of this sort of slow erosion of standards and the long term damage.\n\nSpeaker 1: I also owe you something because It's thanks to you that I've had another look at Tony Blair who I was deeply, deeply skeptical of and I was actually very impressed. I went to an event that he organised, Very impressed by his speech and his engagement with technology, his thoughtfulness about the future work. I think your doorbell's going, though. Is this Lionel Messi turning up\n\nSpeaker 0: to see you again? He's arrived. It might be Ronaldo. I don't know. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we're we're waiting for Alastair to return. I'm looking at his bookshelf, and I'm looking at a door. There's some will be dreaming. There's some strange guest coming in.\n\nSpeaker 0: This person has even brought me a nice Christmas presents Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bridget present.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bridget present.\n\nSpeaker 1: Bridget. But who is this? Because you're in the way of the camera. I can't see the person.\n\nSpeaker 2: At the moment.\n\nSpeaker 0: You'd have to put an ear you'd have to put an earphone.\n\nSpeaker 2: You're not seriously in\n\nSpeaker 0: It's it's\n\nSpeaker 1: just being filmed. This is it's David Miliband leaning at Alastair's feet. It's absolutely extraordinary. David, hello.\n\nSpeaker 2: David Miliband is playing Santa. I brought Alastair his, Christmas I'm sorry. And Fiona, but it's slightly Alastair focused. Two Christmas presents.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, Dave, we're very, very excited to have you. And he he he talks you up a lot, so I wasn't quite sure whether you were gonna be one of the most famous footballers in the world or I said I\n\nSpeaker 0: said Lionel Messi was gonna\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh my god. I'm I feel like I've disappointed you. As always, I feel disappointed. This This is making me feel like I'm very close to kissing you. Can you put this in the other ear?\n\nSpeaker 0: I put my yeah. Like that. Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Actually, we Alastair and I were being photographed. We got very close to kissing each other. We all made our photographs almost nose to nose.\n\nSpeaker 2: What? The Royal Albert Hall in front of 5,500 people?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It was very disturbing. David, Quick question for you. We're doing our events of the year, and somebody called Emily O'Brien's written it, and I'm gonna give you a second because it's not unfair to you. I'm gonna get Alastair to answer first.\n\nMistake of the year in politics and personally. We'll give you a bit of time. I'm gonna let Alastair think about it while you think about mistake of the year.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you mean being our own mistakes or other people's I think a\n\nSpeaker 1: A mistake someone else's mistake in politics.\n\nSpeaker 0: Trust QuaTing, without a doubt.\n\nSpeaker 1: That was pretty colossal,\n\nSpeaker 0: wasn't it? The 2nd award for trust in QuaTing.\n\nSpeaker 2: In the in the in the demerits of the year?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. John, then I think\n\nSpeaker 2: the mistake of the year was Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This was a bad year for dictators In various ways, it was a very bad year for people around the world in some in extreme circumstances, but I think Putin's invasion will go down as Grand historical error on Napoleonic scale.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think David Miliband's mistake of the year is kneeling down at my\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not at your feet. I'm at exactly, I've got this rather difficult, thing, but I want you to, open the present because the The the tree's motif has got\n\nSpeaker 1: He's opening a present just for those of you who are listening to this. Oh, you\n\nSpeaker 0: can listen to the look.\n\nSpeaker 1: What's he giving you?\n\nSpeaker 0: How to be more tree.\n\nSpeaker 2: Now just ex with the I'm\n\nSpeaker 1: very old.\n\nSpeaker 0: Look at it. Don't don't don't don't\n\nSpeaker 2: do what children do and throw the book present away before you've looked at it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Great trees of New York map.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, was he expecting a Pokemon or something, and now he's really disappointed?\n\nSpeaker 2: But look look the the thing is it tells you how this now, I'm afraid, just\n\nSpeaker 0: in case you are suffering from\n\nSpeaker 2: low self esteem, this will show that, Actually, your obsession with trees is quite well It is. Grounded. Look at what the chapter\n\nSpeaker 0: life lessons for perennial happiness. I've always believed trees can make you happy.\n\nSpeaker 2: No. The the trees don't the trees have figured out how to be happy. Look at the chapter headings.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Beginnings are always small. Japanese maple tree. Patience in the Vertu. I've heard that one.\n\nDraw strength from our draw strength from our husband, Alastair.\n\nSpeaker 1: The where where do you get with the patience? There's a virtue one, Alastair, then.\n\nSpeaker 2: Ask for help when you need it. The Elm tree does that.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's fabulous.\n\nSpeaker 0: Environment. The American nation beach. Be authentic. Hornby. Hornby.\n\nAlways have a plan b.\n\nSpeaker 2: Not for what's\n\nSpeaker 0: your plan b, David?\n\nSpeaker 2: Plan I'm on to plan n by now, I think, rather than plan b.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank you very much.\n\nSpeaker 2: Is this are you podcasting in, the questions Podcast was\n\nSpeaker 0: just a domain. Awards. We're doing a special award.\n\nSpeaker 1: Special award ceremony. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 2: How many have you won for yourselves?\n\nSpeaker 0: Hasn't won it. Well, the podcast was the the success of the podcast was the surprise.\n\nSpeaker 1: David, I I want you to have a chance to talk properly to Anastar, but can we just quickly just do the last bits on this pod?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. David's not staying. He's going. He's I'm\n\nSpeaker 2: I'm not. Well, he's got very important people to see.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let's do event Event of the year, sport. Event of the year, culture. And then let you have 5 minutes chat to David. So, Gun, what's what's your event of the year, sport? What's your event of the\n\nSpeaker 2: year, culture? In sport. Well, you'd have to say the World Cup, I I think. But the\n\nSpeaker 0: I think there's\n\nSpeaker 2: English cricket English cricket has been amazing this year. Mhmm. Amazing. Just extraordinary.\n\nSpeaker 0: I have to say, I think Burnley be absolutely destroying Blackburn Rovers was up there. I do think Ben Stokes should have been Sports Personality I know it was fantastic. You wouldn't run the football, and Beth Reid is a great footballer. But the bench what Ben Stowe has done this year has been extraordinary. My cultural event of the year Mhmm.\n\nYep. It's Abba Voyage.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, yeah. That's\n\nSpeaker 0: And if you haven't seen it, go and see it. I know but it also has a political connotation to this because it did it did make me worry about the potential for deep fake.\n\nSpeaker 1: Because you because you you really thought you were watching ABBA even though you were sitting next to ABBA.\n\nSpeaker 0: You were watching the 4 members of ABBA perform live. It was incredible.\n\nSpeaker 1: Despite the fact they were sitting next to you. So Michael Chandler, yeah, just to remind of all the things that have happened this year is the queen's funeral. It's extraordinary that this year has seen so much. The Boris Johnson mistrust, car crashes, Donald Trump temporarily imploding, Putin's version of Ukraine, but the queen's queen's funeral Queen's funeral. The death of the queen, I think, has been a massive epochal event for Britain.\n\nSpeaker 0: Perhaps also worth mentioning as a as a great cultural event, the list of trust curtsy. Perhaps perhaps we should just abolish the whole curtsy thing, Rory. What do you think? I think the curtsy thing\n\nSpeaker 2: is Does Rory curtsy to you when he comes into the podcast?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think he curtsies to me, but I suspect he does curtsy when he meets Camilla.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, at at the moment, I noticed David's actually kneeling to you, which I've never actually done.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yes. That you can't see me below my midriff or above my sort of My chin. Below my chin.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think we should let David stay because the other thing we're doing is a lifetime achievement award. Oh, okay. Now we've only decided who this is because it's the only one we had to agree on. Mhmm. And we've agreed to agree that our the first ever Rest is Politics Lifetime achievement award goes to Neil and Glynis Kinnock.\n\nSpeaker 2: Wow. That was very nice.\n\nSpeaker 0: Neil because of his role in paving the way.\n\nSpeaker 1: And Glenys Glenys, who's head of a great public career, but also has been struggling a little bit with dementia.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. About which they're now talking openly as a way of trying to raise awareness and better service, etcetera. Of course, Glenys worked for you at the\n\nSpeaker 2: was A minister in the foreign office, very lucky for me. She was extraordinarily committed. She had this Real experience, from the European Parliament on the worksheet done in Africa. Neil was actually the chairman of the British Council when we appointed Glenys as the minister, and he then felt he had to resign Yeah. From the British Council to avoid any suggestions\n\nSpeaker 0: Shay. Reminds you. Can you imagine any of this\n\nSpeaker 2: Honestly, I I it hadn't really occurred to anyone that there was a reason for him to there was no reason for him to resign. But he he immediately said, I think it's fantastic that Glenys is being made a minister. She was briefly minister for Europe and then went became minister for Africa. He said I can't carry on in this role because you know what it'll be like. People will say that something will come up and people will say that It wasn't right, so he resigned, which and he'd done an amazing job.\n\nHe'd been 4 or 5 years as the chairman of the British Council.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, well, that's I think that's a very good thing to end on, and we're gonna let Alastair and David, chat for a few minutes. And thank you all so much for listening to The Restless Politics special events.\n\nSpeaker 0: No, Roy. You've gotta do better than that. Thank you so much for joining us at the rest is politics awards for 2022. See you next year. That's how\n\nSpeaker 1: you See you next year.",
