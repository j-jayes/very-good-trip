Welcome to another episode of the rest of Politics Question Time with me, Alastair Campbell. And me, Rory Stewart. And this is all a bit muddled, listeners, because we decided last week that the best time for Rory and I get together was Monday morning in different continents as ever. But Monday morning has thrown up something of a unexpected development, which is Jeremy Hunt's Going to make a statement later in the day. So what we're going to do is we're recording question time now, and we're gonna steer well clear of Trussonomics and Conservative mismanagement. We're gonna q and a on lots of other issues. And then at the end of today, we will record The Baid Podcast, which will be out before this one. I hope that all makes absolute sense. Rory's looking confused at his hotel room in Malawi, But there we are. So are you clear, Rory, with what we're doing? I'm absolutely clear. We're not gonna talk too much about Trussonomics. We're gonna focus on other questions coming in on other issues, of which There have been well over a 1000 questions coming in in about 24 hours. So and you, of course, Alastair, being the hardworking one of this pair, the wise out of the Morecambe and wise, Have been through all those 1,000 questions, haven't you? And I'll tell you one subject that comes up a lot, and that is the so called deputy prime minister for how long, Teresa Coffey and her role as health secretary. Let me just give you a flavor. Debs White, working in the health service, things are awful. Nurses and junior doctors is likely to strike. People are dying waiting for ambulances. There's no serious plan from government. This is going to impact 1,000,000 over the winter. Why isn't this higher on the news agenda? Oh, and what would a serious plan look like? Mike Foster, do ministers now completely ignore civil servants' advice? I'm really puzzled coffee's statements on allowing surplus medicines to be handed out on request for unused antibiotics to be shared with friends, for pharmacists to dispense antibiotics people whose medical histories are unknown. And this one, Jenny King. Should Therese Coffey be arrested for saying that she supplies prescription drugs to her friends. I mean, Rory, we have a health secretary who says she doesn't really care whether the nurses go on strike or not because they're gonna get them from abroad. Good luck with that post Brexit. Set. She says that she gives out antibiotics to her friends. She is going back on anti obesity and anti smoking strategies that I think most of us thought were good things to do. She is the 1 woman anti health coalition. It's it's pretty amazing, isn't it? It's also interesting because she's she's actually a very you know, she's somebody with a doctorate. She's an unusual. We've heard a lot about the fact that MPs and ministers often don't have any scientific background, and she's somebody who had a PhD in chemistry and actually began working as a scientists in in British companies. So it it is particularly bizarre, and, I think I mean, it's one thing for her to try to argue that There could be reforms on access to antibiotics. That's very controversial because, obviously, there are people who think that antibiotic control is essential to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. But Therese Koffi is right that in much of the world, you can get antibiotics at a pharmacy without a doctor's prescription. So If this question of antibiotic resistance is a global issue, it's certainly true that most of the countries that I work and live in, if you want antibiotics, you just go to a pharmacy and get them. That's one thing, which is to make a policy argument about access, but the second thing is for her to say that she's been handing out antibiotics to friends Illegally at the moment before she's changed the policy. Exactly. But I look. I I was having my usual swim this morning, and swimming alongside me in the medium lane was doctor Jim Down, who's a wonderful chap, and he's also he's the guy I've mentioned before who's written 2 splendid books about life as a an intensive care consultant. But he said that, he was explaining to me that if you go, for example, in some countries, he mentioned Greece particularly, you can get the antibiotics over the counter, But that they actually are no longer effective to the treatment of most things that historically antibiotics were treated. And, of course, Jim O'Neill, who was a minister in the last government, might might be a minister in the Labour government as well, the way things are going. But he he's done this big review about the the growing resistance to antibiotics. I just think it's an extraordinary thing for the health secretary to say. And I can't I can't help thinking that if we weren't in the middle of this other sort of bigger Economic and political convulsion. It would that not be like huge news? The the health secretary says it's okay To give medication without consulting a doctor. Is that not libertarianism gone insane? Well, I think it I think it would be huge issues. I do think there's a very I I mean, all these things are tough and interesting debates. And as I say, you would have people from the World Health Organization and health ministers in many other countries backing her view That we're over restrictive on prescriptions in Britain, but I agree with you. That's a policy debate that we should be having openly. Certainly, what she shouldn't be doing is saying that she's handing out antibiotics to her friends before the policies change. On antimicrobial resistance, I mean, it is an extraordinary thing. Between 700,000 and several 1000000 deaths a year are coming because bacteria are adapting very quickly to antibiotics, and we're having to move from these more Broad spectrum, I think, to more narrow spectrum antibiotics to try to pick up on these diseases. And some of that has to do with people not completing their prescriptions so that the Drug learns during the course of the prescription to fight, but it's a very difficult thing to deal with because, of course, it's not something That is primarily driven by a small country of 70,000,000 people. It's driven by the billions of people in the world and exactly whether people in South Asia or Africa as well as in Europe are completing their prescriptions. And, certainly, if you're very poor, and this is another thing I've seen a lot of, many parts of the world, if you're very poor, if you begin to feel better, A few pills into your, antibiotics. You will stop taking them and try to save them up from another occasion because if you're living on $2 a day. You you simply can't afford those antibiotics. Yeah. Now, Alastair, you did this incredible job on pulling together questions, so I'm gonna have a look at some of these questions. One of the things which I thought was very striking this week are the number of questions around Liz Truss' mental health, and there's been a sense that Although people are horrified by what Liz Truss has done, there is interestingly quite a lot of empathy being shown by our listeners towards Personally, psychologically, what she must be going through, people are beginning to sense, along with the horror of what she's inflicted on the economy, the horror of what She must have inflexed on herself, so she took over as prime minister a few weeks ago. It's the job that's presumably she's been looking for for her entire life. She's been in the cabinet for 12 years, presumably sitting there in the cabinet thinking she could do a much better job than the other people who were Sitting in the middle of the table, and now she's taken over the job and she has had I think I'm right in saying the most Disastrous public humiliation of any prime minister on historical record because it's true there were disasters in the 18th 19th century, but that was before the development of modern media and social media, so the humiliation wouldn't have been quite as public. So here's question from Jane Hillier. While I despise her politics, I'm finding myself concerned for Liz Truss' mental health. The level of pressure she is under is unfathomable. Are there safeguards in place to help senior politicians, and are they sufficient? Well, I remember At the last general election, I was approached by more than 1 MP because of my kind of mental health campaigning hat, More than 1 MP and not just Labour, 1 Victorian, 2 or 3 Labour. And there were people who were on the edge And who could not decide whether they could face another term. In a couple of cases, they couldn't decide whether they could face the humiliation of being defeated, which they thought might happen. As it happens, they all stood again, and they all came back. But I was able to tell, one of them knew, but the others didn't know, There is actually a psych psychological support scheme for MPs. I actually did put one of them in touch with so they they This person didn't want to go down that road. I put them in touch with somebody else outside that system. So there are systems in place, but I think the difference If you get to that level of scrutiny as prime minister and only the prime minister is the only that's the only job where this kind of scrutiny really happens. Yes, chancellors. Yes, Secretaries of state, when you're really high profile, yes, if there's a big scandal. But in terms of systemic, sustained, relentless pressure and and scrutiny. It's the prime minister where that goes. And I think to get there, as Tony Blair did, as John Major did, as they all did, all the previous prime ministers, We can maybe talk a little bit about your friend, Theresa May, because I think maybe she's interesting in this regard as well. I think you have to have A little bit of imposter syndrome. You have to have an understanding in yourself that this is a bit weird to be here. And I think that one of Liz Truss's problems I could be wrong about this. I don't know as well as you do. But I have a sense that she doesn't suffer from imposter syndrome. She doesn't think there's anything remotely odd about the fact of her being prime minister. She didn't think there was anything remotely odd about her going around the hustings and coming up with these balmy ideas that Sunak was calling out as being Ruinous. But because they were her ideas, she felt they were right. And I don't know if she's just I think she lacks Any real self awareness. And you only it's only if you have self awareness that if you do Get into psychological distress that you actually have the wherewithal to know that you need help. Now I could be wrong. She might be seeing somebody for all I know. In in a sense, maybe That would make us if if that's true, I don't know whether that but that's true. So, I mean, it is true that she doesn't publicly, show much introspection or, that kind of self awareness. But as you say, that may actually make it more dangerous and more fragile because then the tension between the way in which She might see herself in what's happening becomes more extreme. The the, Andrew Mitchell, who I know is is somebody that is a friend of mine and is is a friend of yours Who was the, conservative secretary of state for international development, has written a book called Beyond the Fringe, which is about his time in parliament. And in it, He goes in a lot of detail into what happened to him mentally after Plebgate. Yeah. Plebgate. So this is the occasion where he turns up at the gates of the house, comes on his bicycle, and he gets into an altercation with a policeman. And he claimed right the way through to a legal case that he did not call the guy a pleb, and, certainly, one of the policemen passing who claimed to have witnessed it turned out later to have lied. But, anyway, the question of What happened or what didn't happen isn't the key. The key is that he found himself receiving, you know, a 1,000 abusive emails a day. The Journalists camped outside his front door, his elderly mother receiving abusive letters and people shouting through his letterbox, and he went into Quite a serious 2 year depression. And there there are other MPs that I know who there was an MP when I joined who very sadly Threw himself under an underground train and by some complete miracle wasn't killed very shortly after the 2010 election. And one of the problems that, I think, Four MPs going to counseling in the House of Commons or being honest with the whips is that they fear quite rightly that often colleagues hear, and it affects It's their careers and their ability to get a job. There was another MP who was known to have had a breakdown in his ministerial office. And, again, that kind of helped him. Actually, I spoke to Andrew quite a lot during that period because it is quite odd how Tory MPs seem to think that they can't trust me at an inch When it comes to anything political, but they all talk to me about the deepest secrets of their mental health. But, you know, I've I've known Andre for a long, long time. I'll tell you a funny story. When I was back in my days on The Mirror, I was asked to write a piece tipping 6 people for the very top in politics. This is way, way, way, way back before John Major became prime minister, and I tipped John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Mo Molam, One other that I've forgotten and Andrew Mitchell. Andrew always says that, you know, I got 3 prime ministers and a Is there a legendary secretary of state who, who helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, plus And I I also do think, though, that Tony Madrid said as well, how much does a battery night the prime minister is getting affect the politicians' self confidence? I know you need a thick skin in that job, but surely it must create self doubt in their ability to do the job. And the point I was making about Theresa Mayrall is, again, you can probably you know her best than I do, but I always felt that with Theresa May, she did have imposter syndrome. I had a sense that she didn't maybe feel that she was meant to be there as the prime minister, And that may be what sort of made her come across sometimes as very unconfident and very unsure of herself, but that, I think, can make A certain sort of politician, much more effective. I always felt with Angela Merkel that there was no arrogance to Angela Merkel because I think She woke up most days thinking, can't quite believe that I'm chancellor for so long. I think you need a bit of that. Yeah. Well, tell us a bit about imposter syndrome. How is it you define imposter Syndra. Well, I I think it's when you when you feel I think it's just a moment of checking yourself. I think if you're the very few people get to be prime minister. Although with this law at the moment, it's kind of by the end of it, most Members of the cabinet will be prime ministers because they're gonna change them once a week, it would seem. But very few people get to be prime minister. And you obviously have to have very, very special qualities to get there. But I think one of the things that makes you keeps you rooted in the real world is if you occasionally say to yourself, I can't quite believe that I'm doing this. I actually think it's imposter syndrome. I quite often get asked, why don't why didn't I go into Frontline politics myself, not just as somebody helping other people, but and I think part of it is I mean, I used to get terrible imposter syndrome when I was, Frankly, whenever I was in a room with Nelson Mandela, I used to sit there thinking, what on earth have I done to to deserve to be here and to feel that I'm alongside this Extraordinary human being and to be I mean, I remember once Nelson Mandela asking me a question about what I thought he should do in relation To a situation that he was managing, and I thought, I can't quite believe this. And I think that maybe that's what stops me, but I think you need a bit of that to check yourself And to check the decisions that you're making. Because what obviously happened with Liz Truss and Quasi Quateau is that they decided that because it was them in the position they were in, they were right. And that's what pushes away. You push away advice, and you push away doubt. And I think that's very, very dangerous. Yeah. And, well, what what they're going through at the moment, I mean, It's it's completely horrifying because it it's not simply I think it getting the balance right between saying that one can disagree profoundly with their politics, but also try to empathize slightly with what they must be going through because, remember, they're not just finding themselves with A 100,000 Twitter comments attacking them and the media attacking them day in, day out, but also all their colleagues that they've been in parliament with for 12 years, turning against them almost immediately so they will feel humiliated, attacked, Betrayed. But I don't I I want I wonder if she does, Rory. I wonder if she does, because I think if you did, you wouldn't have Behaved as she behaved at that press conference. You wouldn't have performed as she has in recent days. And I I also do think there is the old adage, if you can't stand the heat, Get out of the kitchen. But also, I think at that level of politics, if you have any doubt about being able to stand there, don't go into the kitchen in the 1st place. I think look. The one of my favorite stories about politics and mental health was the prime minister of Norway who had very, very bad depression, and he stood down. He wanted to resign completely, and the cabinet wouldn't let him. He was called Brondovic, I think. And he he he so he's he said to the cabinet, I'm going to resign because I can't I can't do the job in the state of mind that I'm in. And they rebelled. And they said, no. No. You're going to stay as prime minister, but you're going to take a break. And the deputy prime minister will stand in. His poll ratings went stratospheric. He came back and was pretty successful by most prime ministerial standards. And I think that's a great story because I think that's what we should be able to do. But I think in our system, because it is so brutal, I think if you get to the that job of being prime minister, you have to be able to to deal with the heat. And I think that what's got her there it's a bit like Johnson. The things that got him there are the things that proved his undoing. And I think the things that have got her there, This absolute iron belief that what she says is right, even if it's the opposite of what she said the day before, I think it's going to be her undoing. Yeah. Well, lots lots more to think about. I mean, I think there are lots of contradictions and paradoxes there that we've got to unpick because on the one hand, we're saying the job is too big for anyone, and It would be perfectly rational to have imposter syndrome and that anybody who thought that they could do the job completely probably shouldn't have the job. And then on the other hand, we're saying if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. So there's a lot of things to unpick, but let's take a quick break and then maybe come back to Something which I think will probably appeal to you, which is the telegraph on Project Fear. Welcome back to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. I'm Erzgamul. So here we I as I promised just before the break, Julie Mitchell, telegraphed purchased an article stating that Project Fear was correct and that Brexit is to blame for our current situation. How surprised are you that this was published by this newspaper? Lots of questions on it. So this is something that I've been slightly teasing you about Occasionally, which is that you tend to regard these right wing newspapers as completely monolithic, but I often observe, because I probably read the Telegraph more than you do and the mail more than you do. Well, if you read them if you read them at all, that's that that is a statement of truth. That often you do find bits of dissension and disagreement. Not always, but at the moment, they're being incredibly brutal, for example, Towards the conservative government and The Times which you often write off as a right wing newspaper has been publishing some pretty positive pieces about Labour's economic growth plan and Jonathan Reynolds, That sort of thing. Anyway, how surprised were you that The Telegraph has come out and said that Project Fear was right all along? Well, as you say, it's 1, columnist, somebody called Warner, I think his name was. Is it Jeremy Warner? Jeremy Warner. That's right. Yeah. There are still people there are still people in the telegraph banging on about how they've got to stick to their guns on the mini budget. I wasn't that surprised because I think it's I think it's kind of a way of moving towards a position of saying, oh, it wasn't really our idea. Nothing to do with us, GOV. Don't blame us. You have to blame the politicians because they're the ones who led you into it. But, of course, I've said before, I don't think without the right wing media that we would have had the referendum in the 1st place. I think they helped to frame the argument that forced Cameron to having the referendum at all. Brexit is an unmitigated disaster. I can't see anything good about it at all. I think the consequences of it are getting worse, not better. And I think the Telegraph are just probably reflecting the the fact that they're seeing in the reaction of their readers The that's how a lot of them are feeling too. And it's interesting how the European Research Group, As this the the kind of right wing absolute Brex streamers people, as the Truss implosion is happening, they're keeping very, very quiet, I notice. For example, prior to the implosion, the idea of Jeremy Hunt being appointed as chancellor's east checker, who who voted you you voted remain, you know, or Or he voted Remain as a terrible human being. So they they would have rebelled at that, but they're kinda keeping their I think they realized that they are basically seen now as part of the problem. They thought they were masters of the Thought they were masters of the universe, and they no longer are. Okay. Charlie Winstanley, would be great given Rory's fondness for semiconductors if you could talk a little about the move Biden has just made to stymie Chinese production of advanced semiconductors. So just update people for a little bit, and then then we'll get your, views on this. So a slightly obscure bureau in the United States called the Bureau of Industry and Security has just announced a whole series of measures, Extraterritorial measures, which are to limit the export to China of advanced semiconductor chip making equipment. And this has tightened up an enormous amount from where they were before. So the number of, Chinese companies on the list Has gone from a 130 to 532 in the last 4 years. And at Huawei, which is this Giant Chinese company, this giant Chinese entity, is a kind of, sort of, has this immense presence on the list. So Huawei has all US export controls are now banned to Huawei, and when the US does this, It has far more consequences than just the US because any company dealing with the US doesn't want to fall foul of US regulators. In fact, it was one of the things that made Dealing with sanctions for the Taliban in Afghanistan, very, very complicated back in August last year because once the US treasury had imposed sanctions, it was very Called for any other company or any other country to do anything other than follow their lead. So this is a very aggressive form of technological decoupling Taking place. Well, it's also incredibly interesting, and it and it shows, Roy, how I mean, I remember when the that guy did the rest of his politics bingo, and your obsession with Taiwanese semiconductors was was one of the first things that they spotted, but it shows you're ahead of your time on this because it depresses me the extent to which Whilst you have the in and uncensmice of this world saber rattling about the Chinese, what Biden is doing in this move is actually to recognize that the Chinese, dominance in some of these spheres is having a direct impact upon future prospects The American and therefore the global economy. So they he's kind of he's he's reacting. And so I thought it was a very, very interesting move, and and it Showed that he understands, I think, that this kind of conflict in small c between America and China is moving into a different phase. And maybe it's worth just reflecting In that context, on the fact that Xi Jinping just had his, they're in the middle now of the the the Chinese Communist Party's Annual congress. And and, of course, he's he's there, standing up there, and he was he was making some pretty provocative statements about The West about America. He was also warn warning the Chinese people that there are some very, very difficult storms ahead. And most insignificantly, He was cementing his own power. Sufficient, I think, for us to be able to say. I think it's now a very close toss-up When we say we always have for most of our lifetime, we've said that the most powerful man in the world or woman in the world, whether ever to happen, Is the president of the United States? But I think we could argue that Xi Jinping is at least on a par now. But I I thought it was very, very interesting. And and and I I think that the It it is part of this broader economic battle, and that's the bit of our debate that I just feel is missing. Yeah. Well, can I I I mean, just just on this? I think one of the things that as we get into this that's very striking in the United States and in Britain particularly Is the lack of voices cautioning in the other direction? This decision to go very, very hard in on decoupling The western economies from China, and it's not just western economies, the US has put huge pressure on Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to come along with them, has incredibly deep impacts, and that decoupling, even over the last few years, has already had a very unsettling effect on the global economic order. So I think it's striking that all the cards are now on the hands of people pushing for more and more restriction, But there's no real debate at all in the US that the democrats are trying to outcompete the republicans on being anti China, But we do need voices to remind us of just how extreme economic consequences could be if we end up getting into a trade war with China. I think Perfectly possible if this keeps going that China will take a case to WTO. China could restrict the export of essential raw Controls 85% of the world's raw ice and minerals. And the whole global economic order since China joined the WTO in the early 2000 has been based around a very deep Intimate relationship between China and the global economies. And at its most extreme, if we pushed very hard and radically for decoupling and China began to respond, You could end up with a potential 30% loss in the global economy. So it is worth Raising these points that we're getting into a world where geostrategic arguments are trumping economic arguments, and we can see the economic consequences already that are very tough tickets. Sanctions, counter sanctions on Russia, Ukraine are one of the major things that have driven the European economies into a recession and will drive the US economy into recession. But it's nothing compared to what will happen if we up the, sanctions and rhetoric against China. So There's a very interesting trade off now that we're living, that we were never living 5 years ago between our economic interests and our geostrategic interests. Well, so you you you would presumably be felt comfortable when Cameron and Osborne were getting much, much closer to China. Now I think that we've maybe gone too far the other way. I wasn't a big enthusiast for their push for China. I've always felt that China is a highly nationalistic country that cares primarily about Chinese interests and that it's a mistake to imagine that China is an altruistic player. I We're saddened that Britain, under Labour and under Cameron, didn't reach more into the other emerging economies of Asia. We were late To get really develop our relationships with Indonesia, for example, which is huge population and a huge producing country, so we could have done much more to balance Mhmm. Approach to Asia, but I also think that somebody needs to start reminding people of the risks and the costs So this kind of confrontation with China. Yeah. And I think, eventually, we'll be gonna be feeling it in our pockets at a time when I think we're going into a 10 year recession. Now, Lisei Topfer. Hi. The current affairs class at Lisei Topfoe, Geneva, here again still waiting for a mention of our fab teacher, missus Harris, And we'd like to ask why you rarely mention the Commonwealth, what's the point of it, and do you think the Commonwealth has a future? Well, Lee Sei Topffer, Geneva. That's the first time I've looked at every question we've ever had, and I've never seen that one. So unless you've been sending them To one of the channels that I don't look at. So we're very, very happy to mention you're a fab teacher, missus Harris. It's very important to remember who our good teachers are. I can remember all of my good teachers, in particular the ones that taught me French and German. Why do we rarely mention the Commonwealth? What's the point of it, and do you think it has a future? Poor. Do we re we probably do already mention the comma. I think we might have mentioned it around the point of around Chogam. What's the point of it? I'm gonna leave that one to you. Do you think he has a future? It definitely has a future and I think actually the Commonwealth got a bit of a markup in some of the coverage around the Queen's death. I I think people had a better sense of what it was for. It's a kind of bringing together of those nations that feel they have this special connection to Us, the UK, I guess, the debates of colonization have, have been pretty strong within it. There are quite a few who I think will be Look at the debate about who the queen is going to be head of state for. It's gonna carry on in certain countries, not least Australia. I was reading at the weekend. But what do you see, Roy? You've had more to do with the Commonwealth than I have through your different work. So the Commonwealth began, obviously, with a very ambitious idea that it could retain Britain's sphere of influence in places which were former British colonies. And, of course, that model hasn't survived. It can't survive because nobody's interested in being stuck in an alliance with a formal colonial power. It's now expanded. It's now taken on countries which weren't part of the British Empire. Rwanda, for example, just joined the Commonwealth. It's Not a trading block, obviously, and it has much less power and influence than its creators imagined. India It's obviously the most powerful expanding economy within the Commonwealth, and one of the problems is that India has never taken the Commonwealth that seriously. So when we talk about the size of the Commonwealth economies, we're often thrown off balance by India. Last time I checked, India had only 2 people in their foreign service Focused on the Commonwealth at all. That's all said. I think it is another possible route for soft power. It's done some interesting things on education. It's done some interesting things on values, and I think it could be a mechanism, for example, for Leaning in on a use such as climate change and the environment. So I think it's a organization people are happy to belong to. It's interesting that Rwanda wanted to join it, But it it very much is the softer end of soft power. Christopher Wilson, fox hunting is still taking place under the lie of trail hunting. These people claim their vile Porter's tradition, is it time to put a final end to this barbarity? Now I don't really know much about fox hunting or trail hunting, but is that True? Are they doing it under a different guise? So a a lot of the time when you you set off on a trail hunt on people I I don't hunt, But my understanding is that often when people are trail hunting, they will pick up the scent of a fox, and the dogs will kill the fox. In in Cumbria, a lot of the hunting was done on foot. It's not a sort of upper class pastime. It's the foot packs which go around Glencathre around the Lake Districts are often local farmers, but, definitely, many of the opponents are are pointing out that foxes continue to be killed. David McKenzie, given you a recent conversation on what makes for the Liberal Democrats, do you foresee any Tony Blair, Paddy Ashdown style unwritten agreement on seats? I'm not sure we had as much of a long written agreement. I do think Keir Starmer and her Davy, I hope they're talking to each other. I hope they've got their lists of seats, and I hope that where the Lib Dems are better placed to win, that Labour don't fight too hard. I mean, how would you approach if you were Labour in the Lib Dems or you were the Lib Dems Looking to maximize your support from a pretty low base, how would you handle the the next election? Well well, one of the challenges is that Labour is So far ahead in the opinion polls at the moment. I mean, they're they're up above 50 points. That's that's not gonna that is not going to last. That's not going to last. No way. That's a rush. Think as it gets closer, those those polls will narrow? Absolutely. Eve even with trust. But if we get work 4 weeks, I guess, the argument would have been that The Lib Dems are much better positioned to win some of those seats. Devon, Cornwall, some of the seats around London. I I'm not talking about inner London seats. I'm talking about things just outside the m 25 than, than Labour would be, and it would make sense if one was trying to build a center left coalition for the Lib Dems to step back and some of the labor battle grants and vice versa. And the Tories will try to make that sort of look a bit underhand as they did. You know, they'll talk about the coalition of chaos if they're gonna still try that one, which is not the same thing as the anti growth coalition. But I I I just think Labour and the Lib Dems should be upfront about We are absolutely determined to get the Tories out. Yeah. I don't think anyone minds. I think what people would mind is if Labour started doing a deal with the SNP because then the unionists would be able to say this is about independence of Scotland. But I think in the Lib Dems are not particularly controversial, and I think it, actually, It might be good for both their brands. It might help the Lib Dems win seats, and it might reassure people that Labour is genuinely committed to the center ground. So I think it could be a smart thing for them to do. Final final question as we wrap up question time. More personal question for you from Daniel. Oh, no. Sorry. I got 2 quick question. One one more challenging, one nicer. So, Patrick Chapman, I've noticed a tendency for Campbell Clarett to speak about his loyalty to the Labour Party much like his loyalty to Burnley. Is it right to support parties like football clubs, Or should we be more flexible based on incumbent views and policies? And then I've got a nice one from Daniel once you answer Patrick. Patrick. Well, look, I can't I no longer remember the Labour Party. I was kicked out. I must tell you, by the way, Rory, I had to even my tribalism to Burnley, I was Questioning in the weekend because it was in my diary that we were playing Swansea. I have all the fixtures in my diary. And I don't know why, but I got it into my head That it was an away game. And I booked my train ticket from Paddington to Swansea. And I got as far as Paddington before discovering in a text He's changed the one of the players that we were at home. So I don't know how I did that, but Oh, oh, oh, that would have been very bad. Swansea's quite a long way away. It was bad. Yeah. No. But Burnley's even further. Burnley's even further. So I actually couldn't I didn't have time to get across London, Get to Houston. Get a train. Oh, I'm sorry. So I missed the game, and we won we won we won 4 nil. So all all the yeah. But I'm I am a tribal person, but but what I recognize is that most people aren't. So the point about Bern about a football team. The football team has tried to win every game. A political party in opposition is necessarily having to go out and reach people who didn't support them the last time. So There's a there's a limit to how many bonus supporters you can have because there's only 22,000 seats in the stadium. But politics is very, very different. So What I guess I'm saying is that I accept that my my tribalism is not what most people feel, and it's the most people that parties have to focus on. Very good. Okay. Final question from Daniel. I'm having a very hard time at the moment caring for my dad. And inspired by Alastair, I've turned to diary writing to help rationalize a storm of Feelings. How do you manage such a vast amount? Do you type or handwrite? Do you have rules about regularity or length? No rules, mainly handwrite. But latterly, in recent years, I've taken to typing more. And I wish I'd never started down that road Because I think it makes you lazy, and I've become less disciplined about doing it. And I think I think my memory has started to suffer with it as well, which is probably why I'm going to the wrong railway stations. In fact, I can tell you, I was at the Bodleian Library last week because they were being very, very nice to me, giving me a lovely Special tour, and I realized halfway around that what they were after were the originals of my diaries. But I I really I think handwritten is better. I really do think. If you write with your with a pen, you write with your hand, I think your mind works better. Very good. Okay. Thank you very much, Hassan. Well done on putting up with the delays from Malawi. In fact, the president to Malawi is currently in trouble locally because he flew to London to do a virtual meeting claiming that he got a better broadband connection there, but I'm beginning to sympathize with them a bit. Oh my god. No worry. I I don't Can I just say, you get enough flack already for your under green credentials with your flight? I do not recommend that you fly anywhere In protest at broadband width. Okay? Well, here here I am in Malawi, and so I I thank you for putting up with the delays. Goodbye from me. All the best.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nWelcome to another episode of the rest of Politics Question Time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And this is all a bit muddled, listeners, because we decided last week that the best time for Rory and I get together was Monday morning in different continents as ever. But Monday morning has thrown up something of a unexpected development, which is Jeremy Hunt's Going to make a statement later in the day. So what we're going to do is we're recording question time now, and we're gonna steer well clear of Trussonomics and Conservative mismanagement. We're gonna q and a on lots of other issues. And then at the end of today, we will record The Baid Podcast, which will be out before this one.\n\nI hope that all makes absolute sense. Rory's looking confused at his hotel room in Malawi, But there we are. So are you clear, Rory, with what we're doing?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm absolutely clear. We're not gonna talk too much about Trussonomics. We're gonna focus on other questions coming in on other issues, of which There have been well over a 1000 questions coming in in about 24 hours. So and you, of course, Alastair, being the hardworking one of this pair, the wise out of the Morecambe and wise, Have been through all those 1,000 questions, haven't you?\n\nSpeaker 0: And I'll tell you one subject that comes up a lot, and that is the so called deputy prime minister for how long, Teresa Coffey and her role as health secretary. Let me just give you a flavor. Debs White, working in the health service, things are awful. Nurses and junior doctors is likely to strike. People are dying waiting for ambulances.\n\nThere's no serious plan from government. This is going to impact 1,000,000 over the winter. Why isn't this higher on the news agenda? Oh, and what would a serious plan look like? Mike Foster, do ministers now completely ignore civil servants' advice?\n\nI'm really puzzled coffee's statements on allowing surplus medicines to be handed out on request for unused antibiotics to be shared with friends, for pharmacists to dispense antibiotics people whose medical histories are unknown. And this one, Jenny King. Should Therese Coffey be arrested for saying that she supplies prescription drugs to her friends. I mean, Rory, we have a health secretary who says she doesn't really care whether the nurses go on strike or not because they're gonna get them from abroad. Good luck with that post Brexit.\n\nSet. She says that she gives out antibiotics to her friends. She is going back on anti obesity and anti smoking strategies that I think most of us thought were good things to do. She is the 1 woman anti health coalition.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's pretty amazing, isn't it? It's also interesting because she's she's actually a very you know, she's somebody with a doctorate. She's an unusual. We've heard a lot about the fact that MPs and ministers often don't have any scientific background, and she's somebody who had a PhD in chemistry and actually began working as a scientists in in British companies. So it it is particularly bizarre, and, I think I mean, it's one thing for her to try to argue that There could be reforms on access to antibiotics.\n\nThat's very controversial because, obviously, there are people who think that antibiotic control is essential to prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. But Therese Koffi is right that in much of the world, you can get antibiotics at a pharmacy without a doctor's prescription. So If this question of antibiotic resistance is a global issue, it's certainly true that most of the countries that I work and live in, if you want antibiotics, you just go to a pharmacy and get them. That's one thing, which is to make a policy argument about access, but the second thing is for her to say that she's been handing out antibiotics to friends Illegally at the moment before she's changed the policy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. But I look. I I was having my usual swim this morning, and swimming alongside me in the medium lane was doctor Jim Down, who's a wonderful chap, and he's also he's the guy I've mentioned before who's written 2 splendid books about life as a an intensive care consultant. But he said that, he was explaining to me that if you go, for example, in some countries, he mentioned Greece particularly, you can get the antibiotics over the counter, But that they actually are no longer effective to the treatment of most things that historically antibiotics were treated. And, of course, Jim O'Neill, who was a minister in the last government, might might be a minister in the Labour government as well, the way things are going.\n\nBut he he's done this big review about the the growing resistance to antibiotics. I just think it's an extraordinary thing for the health secretary to say. And I can't I can't help thinking that if we weren't in the middle of this other sort of bigger Economic and political convulsion. It would that not be like huge news? The the health secretary says it's okay To give medication without consulting a doctor.\n\nIs that not libertarianism gone insane?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think it I think it would be huge issues. I do think there's a very I I mean, all these things are tough and interesting debates. And as I say, you would have people from the World Health Organization and health ministers in many other countries backing her view That we're over restrictive on prescriptions in Britain, but I agree with you. That's a policy debate that we should be having openly. Certainly, what she shouldn't be doing is saying that she's handing out antibiotics to her friends before the policies change.\n\nOn antimicrobial resistance, I mean, it is an extraordinary thing. Between 700,000 and several 1000000 deaths a year are coming because bacteria are adapting very quickly to antibiotics, and we're having to move from these more Broad spectrum, I think, to more narrow spectrum antibiotics to try to pick up on these diseases. And some of that has to do with people not completing their prescriptions so that the Drug learns during the course of the prescription to fight, but it's a very difficult thing to deal with because, of course, it's not something That is primarily driven by a small country of 70,000,000 people. It's driven by the billions of people in the world and exactly whether people in South Asia or Africa as well as in Europe are completing their prescriptions. And, certainly, if you're very poor, and this is another thing I've seen a lot of, many parts of the world, if you're very poor, if you begin to feel better, A few pills into your, antibiotics.\n\nYou will stop taking them and try to save them up from another occasion because if you're living on $2 a day. You you simply can't afford those antibiotics.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, Alastair, you did this incredible job on pulling together questions, so I'm gonna have a look at some of these questions. One of the things which I thought was very striking this week are the number of questions around Liz Truss' mental health, and there's been a sense that Although people are horrified by what Liz Truss has done, there is interestingly quite a lot of empathy being shown by our listeners towards Personally, psychologically, what she must be going through, people are beginning to sense, along with the horror of what she's inflicted on the economy, the horror of what She must have inflexed on herself, so she took over as prime minister a few weeks ago. It's the job that's presumably she's been looking for for her entire life. She's been in the cabinet for 12 years, presumably sitting there in the cabinet thinking she could do a much better job than the other people who were Sitting in the middle of the table, and now she's taken over the job and she has had I think I'm right in saying the most Disastrous public humiliation of any prime minister on historical record because it's true there were disasters in the 18th 19th century, but that was before the development of modern media and social media, so the humiliation wouldn't have been quite as public.\n\nSo here's question from Jane Hillier. While I despise her politics, I'm finding myself concerned for Liz Truss' mental health. The level of pressure she is under is unfathomable. Are there safeguards in place to help senior politicians, and are they sufficient?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I remember At the last general election, I was approached by more than 1 MP because of my kind of mental health campaigning hat, More than 1 MP and not just Labour, 1 Victorian, 2 or 3 Labour. And there were people who were on the edge And who could not decide whether they could face another term. In a couple of cases, they couldn't decide whether they could face the humiliation of being defeated, which they thought might happen. As it happens, they all stood again, and they all came back. But I was able to tell, one of them knew, but the others didn't know, There is actually a psych psychological support scheme for MPs.\n\nI actually did put one of them in touch with so they they This person didn't want to go down that road. I put them in touch with somebody else outside that system. So there are systems in place, but I think the difference If you get to that level of scrutiny as prime minister and only the prime minister is the only that's the only job where this kind of scrutiny really happens. Yes, chancellors. Yes, Secretaries of state, when you're really high profile, yes, if there's a big scandal.\n\nBut in terms of systemic, sustained, relentless pressure and and scrutiny. It's the prime minister where that goes. And I think to get there, as Tony Blair did, as John Major did, as they all did, all the previous prime ministers, We can maybe talk a little bit about your friend, Theresa May, because I think maybe she's interesting in this regard as well. I think you have to have A little bit of imposter syndrome. You have to have an understanding in yourself that this is a bit weird to be here.\n\nAnd I think that one of Liz Truss's problems I could be wrong about this. I don't know as well as you do. But I have a sense that she doesn't suffer from imposter syndrome. She doesn't think there's anything remotely odd about the fact of her being prime minister. She didn't think there was anything remotely odd about her going around the hustings and coming up with these balmy ideas that Sunak was calling out as being Ruinous.\n\nBut because they were her ideas, she felt they were right. And I don't know if she's just I think she lacks Any real self awareness. And you only it's only if you have self awareness that if you do Get into psychological distress that you actually have the wherewithal to know that you need help. Now I could be wrong. She might be seeing somebody for all I know.\n\nSpeaker 1: In in a sense, maybe That would make us if if that's true, I don't know whether that but that's true. So, I mean, it is true that she doesn't publicly, show much introspection or, that kind of self awareness. But as you say, that may actually make it more dangerous and more fragile because then the tension between the way in which She might see herself in what's happening becomes more extreme. The the, Andrew Mitchell, who I know is is somebody that is a friend of mine and is is a friend of yours Who was the, conservative secretary of state for international development, has written a book called Beyond the Fringe, which is about his time in parliament. And in it, He goes in a lot of detail into what happened to him mentally after Plebgate.\n\nYeah. Plebgate. So this is the occasion where he turns up at the gates of the house, comes on his bicycle, and he gets into an altercation with a policeman. And he claimed right the way through to a legal case that he did not call the guy a pleb, and, certainly, one of the policemen passing who claimed to have witnessed it turned out later to have lied. But, anyway, the question of What happened or what didn't happen isn't the key.\n\nThe key is that he found himself receiving, you know, a 1,000 abusive emails a day. The Journalists camped outside his front door, his elderly mother receiving abusive letters and people shouting through his letterbox, and he went into Quite a serious 2 year depression. And there there are other MPs that I know who there was an MP when I joined who very sadly Threw himself under an underground train and by some complete miracle wasn't killed very shortly after the 2010 election. And one of the problems that, I think, Four MPs going to counseling in the House of Commons or being honest with the whips is that they fear quite rightly that often colleagues hear, and it affects It's their careers and their ability to get a job. There was another MP who was known to have had a breakdown in his ministerial office.\n\nAnd, again, that kind of helped him.\n\nSpeaker 0: Actually, I spoke to Andrew quite a lot during that period because it is quite odd how Tory MPs seem to think that they can't trust me at an inch When it comes to anything political, but they all talk to me about the deepest secrets of their mental health. But, you know, I've I've known Andre for a long, long time. I'll tell you a funny story. When I was back in my days on The Mirror, I was asked to write a piece tipping 6 people for the very top in politics. This is way, way, way, way back before John Major became prime minister, and I tipped John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Mo Molam, One other that I've forgotten and Andrew Mitchell.\n\nAndrew always says that, you know, I got 3 prime ministers and a Is there a legendary secretary of state who, who helped bring peace to Northern Ireland, plus And I I also do think, though, that Tony Madrid said as well, how much does a battery night the prime minister is getting affect the politicians' self confidence? I know you need a thick skin in that job, but surely it must create self doubt in their ability to do the job. And the point I was making about Theresa Mayrall is, again, you can probably you know her best than I do, but I always felt that with Theresa May, she did have imposter syndrome. I had a sense that she didn't maybe feel that she was meant to be there as the prime minister, And that may be what sort of made her come across sometimes as very unconfident and very unsure of herself, but that, I think, can make A certain sort of politician, much more effective. I always felt with Angela Merkel that there was no arrogance to Angela Merkel because I think She woke up most days thinking, can't quite believe that I'm chancellor for so long.\n\nI think you need a bit of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, tell us a bit about imposter syndrome. How is it you define imposter Syndra.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I think it's when you when you feel I think it's just a moment of checking yourself. I think if you're the very few people get to be prime minister. Although with this law at the moment, it's kind of by the end of it, most Members of the cabinet will be prime ministers because they're gonna change them once a week, it would seem. But very few people get to be prime minister. And you obviously have to have very, very special qualities to get there.\n\nBut I think one of the things that makes you keeps you rooted in the real world is if you occasionally say to yourself, I can't quite believe that I'm doing this. I actually think it's imposter syndrome. I quite often get asked, why don't why didn't I go into Frontline politics myself, not just as somebody helping other people, but and I think part of it is I mean, I used to get terrible imposter syndrome when I was, Frankly, whenever I was in a room with Nelson Mandela, I used to sit there thinking, what on earth have I done to to deserve to be here and to feel that I'm alongside this Extraordinary human being and to be I mean, I remember once Nelson Mandela asking me a question about what I thought he should do in relation To a situation that he was managing, and I thought, I can't quite believe this. And I think that maybe that's what stops me, but I think you need a bit of that to check yourself And to check the decisions that you're making. Because what obviously happened with Liz Truss and Quasi Quateau is that they decided that because it was them in the position they were in, they were right.\n\nAnd that's what pushes away. You push away advice, and you push away doubt. And I think that's very, very dangerous.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And, well, what what they're going through at the moment, I mean, It's it's completely horrifying because it it's not simply I think it getting the balance right between saying that one can disagree profoundly with their politics, but also try to empathize slightly with what they must be going through because, remember, they're not just finding themselves with A 100,000 Twitter comments attacking them and the media attacking them day in, day out, but also all their colleagues that they've been in parliament with for 12 years, turning against them almost immediately so they will feel humiliated, attacked, Betrayed.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I don't I I want I wonder if she does, Rory. I wonder if she does, because I think if you did, you wouldn't have Behaved as she behaved at that press conference. You wouldn't have performed as she has in recent days. And I I also do think there is the old adage, if you can't stand the heat, Get out of the kitchen. But also, I think at that level of politics, if you have any doubt about being able to stand there, don't go into the kitchen in the 1st place.\n\nI think look. The one of my favorite stories about politics and mental health was the prime minister of Norway who had very, very bad depression, and he stood down. He wanted to resign completely, and the cabinet wouldn't let him. He was called Brondovic, I think. And he he he so he's he said to the cabinet, I'm going to resign because I can't I can't do the job in the state of mind that I'm in.\n\nAnd they rebelled. And they said, no. No. You're going to stay as prime minister, but you're going to take a break. And the deputy prime minister will stand in.\n\nHis poll ratings went stratospheric. He came back and was pretty successful by most prime ministerial standards. And I think that's a great story because I think that's what we should be able to do. But I think in our system, because it is so brutal, I think if you get to the that job of being prime minister, you have to be able to to deal with the heat. And I think that what's got her there it's a bit like Johnson.\n\nThe things that got him there are the things that proved his undoing. And I think the things that have got her there, This absolute iron belief that what she says is right, even if it's the opposite of what she said the day before, I think it's going to be her undoing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, lots lots more to think about. I mean, I think there are lots of contradictions and paradoxes there that we've got to unpick because on the one hand, we're saying the job is too big for anyone, and It would be perfectly rational to have imposter syndrome and that anybody who thought that they could do the job completely probably shouldn't have the job. And then on the other hand, we're saying if you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen. So there's a lot of things to unpick, but let's take a quick break and then maybe come back to Something which I think will probably appeal to you, which is the telegraph on Project Fear.\n\nWelcome back to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm Erzgamul.\n\nSpeaker 1: So here we I as I promised just before the break, Julie Mitchell, telegraphed purchased an article stating that Project Fear was correct and that Brexit is to blame for our current situation. How surprised are you that this was published by this newspaper? Lots of questions on it. So this is something that I've been slightly teasing you about Occasionally, which is that you tend to regard these right wing newspapers as completely monolithic, but I often observe, because I probably read the Telegraph more than you do and the mail more than you do.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, if you read them if you read them at all, that's that that is a statement of truth.\n\nSpeaker 1: That often you do find bits of dissension and disagreement. Not always, but at the moment, they're being incredibly brutal, for example, Towards the conservative government and The Times which you often write off as a right wing newspaper has been publishing some pretty positive pieces about Labour's economic growth plan and Jonathan Reynolds, That sort of thing. Anyway, how surprised were you that The Telegraph has come out and said that Project Fear was right all along?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, as you say, it's 1, columnist, somebody called Warner, I think his name was. Is it Jeremy Warner?\n\nSpeaker 1: Jeremy Warner. That's right. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: There are still people there are still people in the telegraph banging on about how they've got to stick to their guns on the mini budget. I wasn't that surprised because I think it's I think it's kind of a way of moving towards a position of saying, oh, it wasn't really our idea. Nothing to do with us, GOV. Don't blame us. You have to blame the politicians because they're the ones who led you into it.\n\nBut, of course, I've said before, I don't think without the right wing media that we would have had the referendum in the 1st place. I think they helped to frame the argument that forced Cameron to having the referendum at all. Brexit is an unmitigated disaster. I can't see anything good about it at all. I think the consequences of it are getting worse, not better.\n\nAnd I think the Telegraph are just probably reflecting the the fact that they're seeing in the reaction of their readers The that's how a lot of them are feeling too. And it's interesting how the European Research Group, As this the the kind of right wing absolute Brex streamers people, as the Truss implosion is happening, they're keeping very, very quiet, I notice. For example, prior to the implosion, the idea of Jeremy Hunt being appointed as chancellor's east checker, who who voted you you voted remain, you know, or Or he voted Remain as a terrible human being. So they they would have rebelled at that, but they're kinda keeping their I think they realized that they are basically seen now as part of the problem. They thought they were masters of the Thought they were masters of the universe, and they no longer are.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Charlie Winstanley, would be great given Rory's fondness for semiconductors if you could talk a little about the move Biden has just made to stymie Chinese production of advanced semiconductors. So just update people for a little bit, and then then we'll get your, views on this. So a slightly obscure bureau in the United States called the Bureau of Industry and Security has just announced a whole series of measures, Extraterritorial measures, which are to limit the export to China of advanced semiconductor chip making equipment. And this has tightened up an enormous amount from where they were before.\n\nSo the number of, Chinese companies on the list Has gone from a 130 to 532 in the last 4 years. And at Huawei, which is this Giant Chinese company, this giant Chinese entity, is a kind of, sort of, has this immense presence on the list. So Huawei has all US export controls are now banned to Huawei, and when the US does this, It has far more consequences than just the US because any company dealing with the US doesn't want to fall foul of US regulators. In fact, it was one of the things that made Dealing with sanctions for the Taliban in Afghanistan, very, very complicated back in August last year because once the US treasury had imposed sanctions, it was very Called for any other company or any other country to do anything other than follow their lead. So this is a very aggressive form of technological decoupling Taking place.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it's also incredibly interesting, and it and it shows, Roy, how I mean, I remember when the that guy did the rest of his politics bingo, and your obsession with Taiwanese semiconductors was was one of the first things that they spotted, but it shows you're ahead of your time on this because it depresses me the extent to which Whilst you have the in and uncensmice of this world saber rattling about the Chinese, what Biden is doing in this move is actually to recognize that the Chinese, dominance in some of these spheres is having a direct impact upon future prospects The American and therefore the global economy. So they he's kind of he's he's reacting. And so I thought it was a very, very interesting move, and and it Showed that he understands, I think, that this kind of conflict in small c between America and China is moving into a different phase. And maybe it's worth just reflecting In that context, on the fact that Xi Jinping just had his, they're in the middle now of the the the Chinese Communist Party's Annual congress. And and, of course, he's he's there, standing up there, and he was he was making some pretty provocative statements about The West about America.\n\nHe was also warn warning the Chinese people that there are some very, very difficult storms ahead. And most insignificantly, He was cementing his own power. Sufficient, I think, for us to be able to say. I think it's now a very close toss-up When we say we always have for most of our lifetime, we've said that the most powerful man in the world or woman in the world, whether ever to happen, Is the president of the United States? But I think we could argue that Xi Jinping is at least on a par now.\n\nBut I I thought it was very, very interesting. And and and I I think that the It it is part of this broader economic battle, and that's the bit of our debate that I just feel is missing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, can I I I mean, just just on this? I think one of the things that as we get into this that's very striking in the United States and in Britain particularly Is the lack of voices cautioning in the other direction? This decision to go very, very hard in on decoupling The western economies from China, and it's not just western economies, the US has put huge pressure on Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan to come along with them, has incredibly deep impacts, and that decoupling, even over the last few years, has already had a very unsettling effect on the global economic order. So I think it's striking that all the cards are now on the hands of people pushing for more and more restriction, But there's no real debate at all in the US that the democrats are trying to outcompete the republicans on being anti China, But we do need voices to remind us of just how extreme economic consequences could be if we end up getting into a trade war with China.\n\nI think Perfectly possible if this keeps going that China will take a case to WTO. China could restrict the export of essential raw Controls 85% of the world's raw ice and minerals. And the whole global economic order since China joined the WTO in the early 2000 has been based around a very deep Intimate relationship between China and the global economies. And at its most extreme, if we pushed very hard and radically for decoupling and China began to respond, You could end up with a potential 30% loss in the global economy. So it is worth Raising these points that we're getting into a world where geostrategic arguments are trumping economic arguments, and we can see the economic consequences already that are very tough tickets.\n\nSanctions, counter sanctions on Russia, Ukraine are one of the major things that have driven the European economies into a recession and will drive the US economy into recession. But it's nothing compared to what will happen if we up the, sanctions and rhetoric against China. So There's a very interesting trade off now that we're living, that we were never living 5 years ago between our economic interests and our geostrategic interests.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, so you you you would presumably be felt comfortable when Cameron and Osborne were getting much, much closer to China. Now I think that we've maybe gone too far the other way.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wasn't a big enthusiast for their push for China. I've always felt that China is a highly nationalistic country that cares primarily about Chinese interests and that it's a mistake to imagine that China is an altruistic player. I We're saddened that Britain, under Labour and under Cameron, didn't reach more into the other emerging economies of Asia. We were late To get really develop our relationships with Indonesia, for example, which is huge population and a huge producing country, so we could have done much more to balance Mhmm. Approach to Asia, but I also think that somebody needs to start reminding people of the risks and the costs So this kind of confrontation with China.\n\nYeah. And I think, eventually, we'll be gonna be feeling it in our pockets at a time when I think we're going into a 10 year recession. Now, Lisei Topfer. Hi. The current affairs class at Lisei Topfoe, Geneva, here again still waiting for a mention of our fab teacher, missus Harris, And we'd like to ask why you rarely mention the Commonwealth, what's the point of it, and do you think the Commonwealth has a future?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Lee Sei Topffer, Geneva. That's the first time I've looked at every question we've ever had, and I've never seen that one. So unless you've been sending them To one of the channels that I don't look at. So we're very, very happy to mention you're a fab teacher, missus Harris. It's very important to remember who our good teachers are.\n\nI can remember all of my good teachers, in particular the ones that taught me French and German. Why do we rarely mention the Commonwealth? What's the point of it, and do you think it has a future? Poor. Do we re we probably do already mention the comma.\n\nI think we might have mentioned it around the point of around Chogam. What's the point of it? I'm gonna leave that one to you. Do you think he has a future? It definitely has a future and I think actually the Commonwealth got a bit of a markup in some of the coverage around the Queen's death.\n\nI I think people had a better sense of what it was for. It's a kind of bringing together of those nations that feel they have this special connection to Us, the UK, I guess, the debates of colonization have, have been pretty strong within it. There are quite a few who I think will be Look at the debate about who the queen is going to be head of state for. It's gonna carry on in certain countries, not least Australia. I was reading at the weekend.\n\nBut what do you see, Roy? You've had more to do with the Commonwealth than I have through your different work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So the Commonwealth began, obviously, with a very ambitious idea that it could retain Britain's sphere of influence in places which were former British colonies. And, of course, that model hasn't survived. It can't survive because nobody's interested in being stuck in an alliance with a formal colonial power. It's now expanded. It's now taken on countries which weren't part of the British Empire.\n\nRwanda, for example, just joined the Commonwealth. It's Not a trading block, obviously, and it has much less power and influence than its creators imagined. India It's obviously the most powerful expanding economy within the Commonwealth, and one of the problems is that India has never taken the Commonwealth that seriously. So when we talk about the size of the Commonwealth economies, we're often thrown off balance by India. Last time I checked, India had only 2 people in their foreign service Focused on the Commonwealth at all.\n\nThat's all said. I think it is another possible route for soft power. It's done some interesting things on education. It's done some interesting things on values, and I think it could be a mechanism, for example, for Leaning in on a use such as climate change and the environment. So I think it's a organization people are happy to belong to.\n\nIt's interesting that Rwanda wanted to join it, But it it very much is the softer end of soft power.\n\nSpeaker 0: Christopher Wilson, fox hunting is still taking place under the lie of trail hunting. These people claim their vile Porter's tradition, is it time to put a final end to this barbarity? Now I don't really know much about fox hunting or trail hunting, but is that True? Are they doing it under a different guise?\n\nSpeaker 1: So a a lot of the time when you you set off on a trail hunt on people I I don't hunt, But my understanding is that often when people are trail hunting, they will pick up the scent of a fox, and the dogs will kill the fox. In in Cumbria, a lot of the hunting was done on foot. It's not a sort of upper class pastime. It's the foot packs which go around Glencathre around the Lake Districts are often local farmers, but, definitely, many of the opponents are are pointing out that foxes continue to be killed.\n\nSpeaker 0: David McKenzie, given you a recent conversation on what makes for the Liberal Democrats, do you foresee any Tony Blair, Paddy Ashdown style unwritten agreement on seats? I'm not sure we had as much of a long written agreement. I do think Keir Starmer and her Davy, I hope they're talking to each other. I hope they've got their lists of seats, and I hope that where the Lib Dems are better placed to win, that Labour don't fight too hard. I mean, how would you approach if you were Labour in the Lib Dems or you were the Lib Dems Looking to maximize your support from a pretty low base, how would you handle the the next election?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well well, one of the challenges is that Labour is So far ahead in the opinion polls at the moment. I mean, they're they're up above 50 points.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's that's not gonna that is not going to last. That's not going to last. No way. That's a rush.\n\nSpeaker 1: Think as it gets closer, those those polls will narrow?\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Eve even with trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: But if we get work 4 weeks, I guess, the argument would have been that The Lib Dems are much better positioned to win some of those seats. Devon, Cornwall, some of the seats around London. I I'm not talking about inner London seats. I'm talking about things just outside the m 25 than, than Labour would be, and it would make sense if one was trying to build a center left coalition for the Lib Dems to step back and some of the labor battle grants and vice versa.\n\nSpeaker 0: And the Tories will try to make that sort of look a bit underhand as they did. You know, they'll talk about the coalition of chaos if they're gonna still try that one, which is not the same thing as the anti growth coalition. But I I I just think Labour and the Lib Dems should be upfront about We are absolutely determined to get the Tories out. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't think anyone minds. I think what people would mind is if Labour started doing a deal with the SNP because then the unionists would be able to say this is about independence of Scotland. But I think in the Lib Dems are not particularly controversial, and I think it, actually, It might be good for both their brands. It might help the Lib Dems win seats, and it might reassure people that Labour is genuinely committed to the center ground. So I think it could be a smart thing for them to do.\n\nFinal final question as we wrap up question time. More personal question for you from Daniel. Oh, no. Sorry. I got 2 quick question.\n\nOne one more challenging, one nicer. So, Patrick Chapman, I've noticed a tendency for Campbell Clarett to speak about his loyalty to the Labour Party much like his loyalty to Burnley. Is it right to support parties like football clubs, Or should we be more flexible based on incumbent views and policies? And then I've got a nice one from Daniel once you answer Patrick.\n\nSpeaker 0: Patrick. Well, look, I can't I no longer remember the Labour Party. I was kicked out. I must tell you, by the way, Rory, I had to even my tribalism to Burnley, I was Questioning in the weekend because it was in my diary that we were playing Swansea. I have all the fixtures in my diary.\n\nAnd I don't know why, but I got it into my head That it was an away game. And I booked my train ticket from Paddington to Swansea. And I got as far as Paddington before discovering in a text He's changed the one of the players that we were at home. So I don't know how I did that, but\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, oh, oh, that would have been very bad. Swansea's quite a long way away.\n\nSpeaker 0: It was bad. Yeah. No. But Burnley's even further. Burnley's even further.\n\nSo I actually couldn't I didn't have time to get across London, Get to Houston. Get a train.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: So I missed the game, and we won we won we won 4 nil. So all all the yeah. But I'm I am a tribal person, but but what I recognize is that most people aren't. So the point about Bern about a football team. The football team has tried to win every game.\n\nA political party in opposition is necessarily having to go out and reach people who didn't support them the last time. So There's a there's a limit to how many bonus supporters you can have because there's only 22,000 seats in the stadium. But politics is very, very different. So What I guess I'm saying is that I accept that my my tribalism is not what most people feel, and it's the most people that parties have to focus on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Final question from Daniel. I'm having a very hard time at the moment caring for my dad. And inspired by Alastair, I've turned to diary writing to help rationalize a storm of Feelings.\n\nHow do you manage such a vast amount? Do you type or handwrite? Do you have rules about regularity or length?\n\nSpeaker 0: No rules, mainly handwrite. But latterly, in recent years, I've taken to typing more. And I wish I'd never started down that road Because I think it makes you lazy, and I've become less disciplined about doing it. And I think I think my memory has started to suffer with it as well, which is probably why I'm going to the wrong railway stations. In fact, I can tell you, I was at the Bodleian Library last week because they were being very, very nice to me, giving me a lovely Special tour, and I realized halfway around that what they were after were the originals of my diaries.\n\nBut I I really I think handwritten is better. I really do think. If you write with your with a pen, you write with your hand, I think your mind works better.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Thank you very much, Hassan. Well done on putting up with the delays from Malawi. In fact, the president to Malawi is currently in trouble locally because he flew to London to do a virtual meeting claiming that he got a better broadband connection there, but I'm beginning to sympathize with them a bit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh my god. No worry. I I don't Can I just say, you get enough flack already for your under green credentials with your flight? I do not recommend that you fly anywhere In protest at broadband width. Okay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, here here I am in Malawi, and so I I thank you for putting up with the delays. Goodbye from me.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best.",
