And me, Alastair Campbell. And, Rory, I wanna start with a an apology to our listeners. When we get things wrong, we always admit to it. And I don't know why I said this because I knew even after I said it, it was wrong. But, anyway, this is from somebody called An Onimus. An Onimus? Oh, anonymous. I see. Very, very funny. Anne Oneimus says, you were very poorly informed about the police Service Northern Ireland data breach. The release of the data was in response to a freedom of information request. It was not due to a cyber attack. It reportedly went through 5 separate checks before being posted. It should not have been so easy as you suggest. It may not have been an accident. Anne Oneimus also goes on to point out It's Catholic members of the PSNI who are at risk of a result of this breach as they're considered by someone on the far right nationalist side as treacherous for having joined the force previously infamous as the RUC. 2nd part of that question, fairly loaded, Anne. What's really strange, Rory, after we recorded it, I realized I'd said that, and I knew it was absolute bollocks, but I forgot to phone the production and tell them. So there we are. It went through. Just on this one. So, I mean, I the the BBC's reported on this. So, Potentially, there were 2 breaches. The first breach happened when data was made public in error in response to an FOI request and appeared online for 3 hours last Tuesday, And then a 2nd data breach involving the theft of a spreadsheet with the names of 200 officers and staff emerged the following day. And that, As she says, it's not a cyber breach. That was actually the theft of a police issue, laptop and radio from a private vehicle, but it's somebody, a second person, just been arrested by no London police, So taking it very seriously, but it's a reminder to all of us because if you read too quickly these stories that says a major data breach, One's immediate assumption is that it's a cyber attack, not that somebody's releasing it in response to a freedom of information. But I knew because I remember I remember thinking at the time, who on earth would have released that as an FYI? So anyway, slap the wrist for me, and I'm blaming the heat. Now the next one is you, populism in Portugal. Tome Ribeiro Hommes. Rory teases with the Portuguese exception to the populist way, but you ended up not going into it on the podcast. The populist Chega party has grown rapidly over its short existence, And indeed it has, Roy. It's now the 3rd political force. And I sorta knew that when you said it, and I thought maybe he knows more than I do here. But, you know, they're going into The European elections, and they're currently at 13.2%, which isn't bad for a, you know, smaller party. They've got 12 seats in parliament. And even though they've got none in the European Parliament, on on that voting, they they gained 3 or 4 seats of Portugal's share in in European Parliament. And they are pretty right wing. I mean, they've they've got similar white supremacists, slightly neo Nazi groups. Well, it's it's definitely true. They do have this party, but Portugal has had a different history to other European countries, and I don't wanna overdo it, but I think that you can make a case that Portugal's been a really remarkable example of moderation. Yeah. You presumably are cheered up by the fact that the 2 main parties are the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic party. Absolutely. Suarez has done pretty well. I mean, you know so, yeah, they're they're they're a rare success story on the more progressive site. It's worth looking at them. Maybe you should look at them a bit more. So, obviously, Guterres, who's the UN secretary general, was was their leader, Antonio Costa, and now, but people often sort of think about Unless they're just a sort of subset of Spain, but in fact, their historical experience is a bit different. Yes. Like Spain, they were under a dictatorship to the early seventies, But it wasn't a dictatorship that, like Franco's, it wasn't one that tried to crush kinda national identities. It didn't have quite the extreme brutality of Franco. They had a much more dramatic transition out of dictatorship. Spain, there were lots of issues that weren't dealt with in the seventies that continue to haunt and you see this through moving Franco's body and stuff. Unlike Spain, they didn't grow into this huge housing bubble And Spain, of course, has massive automobile industry, wind manufacturing, tourism on a one of the largest scales in the world, Whereas Portugal is still very much doing things like manufacturing cork, manufacturing shoes. They're also different because traditionally, A bit like Ireland, which I guess is a maybe a comparable economy in terms of size and scale until it started to grow so quickly, the problem in Portugal wasn't immigration, it was emigration. Portuguese leaving to go to other countries the way that people do from places like Romania or or Albania. So there wasn't the same Underlying stuff and finally I think in the financial crisis, Spain ended up with nearly 50% youth unemployment and I think their general unemployment rate shot up to nearly twice that of Portugal's. So maybe there haven't been quite the same drivers in Portugal in terms of the 2008 financial crisis, immigration and other things. I mean, they still obviously inherit the problems Social media. They did go through a brutal situation, the financial crisis, their debt, but maybe that's part of the reason why they've they've tended to be more moderate And more centrist in their politics since the seventies. Costa is he's now in his 3rd term, which is pretty rare for any leader these days. But there have been Quite a lot of scandals and resignations in recent months in this 3rd term. I think he's lost double figures now. He's he's lost ministers and secretaries of state, which almost Boris Johnson level, and and partly to do with some issues of corruption and also past conducts. But, you know, I think that you're you're broadly right that we're talking about out a pretty successful progressive government. We should thank our eagle ear to Portuguese listener for pointing out that we didn't go back to something that we said We were going to, so thanks for that. Very good. Okay. Next question coming in from Sidharthakare. What are your predictions for For republican primaries, any thoughts on the Reagan oriented Vivek Ramaswamy? Is this the guy that everybody's talking about with the big money coming behind? Yeah. So Vivek Ramaswamy is Very, very young. I think he's in his late thirties. He is famously kind of fast, eloquent talker. He is an extreme isolationist. He seems to want to have America to have almost nothing to do with the world at all. He's, I think, said that if America manages to, get independent with semiconductors, then there's there's no point in defending Taiwan at all. And as Ron DeSantis loses some of his momentum and energy, People are beginning to focus more on Vivek Ramaswami. Well, I I don't know much about him at all, so I'm I'm bound to your superior knowledge on that. Look. I I I feel that unless These legal cases against Trump really do him. I think he's gonna be the candidate. It's not that long ago people were talking about Ron DeSantis as being the great white hope. As you said, yesterday, he's virtually vanished. I see Trump's not turning up for the 1st debate. Chris Christie had a wonderful, wonderful put down on him about that, basically saying that he was both useless and a coward. So there are some sort of voices coming out telling the truth about Trump. Very good. James Thompson, in light of GCSE and a level results, in your well traveled and worldly opinions, which education systems from which country is the most fit for purpose and effective? How should we measure success in schools? We had quite a lot of questions about education this week. Jack Harris, seeing as the education secretary has admitted that a levels and, by extension, exams are pointless in the long term, I was wondering if you could define the point of education. I don't think she was quite Saying that she did say something, I think, rather odd for an education secretary on the day that exams were coming out. She said in 10 years' time, nobody will care. I think that is a very odd message for an education segment you put out there. Well, I'd I'd defend her for a second because I think one of our questioners actually defended her, didn't they? It is true that by the time you're 10 years into the workplace, people don't pay any attention to what your a levels were. Yeah. But is that a sensible thing to say on the day that kids are sweating over their exams? I I just thought it was a very, very odd thing to say. Okay. Even though it's true? Well, it's true in some regards, but you still have to go in. Particularly in the modern world, people having to apply for jobs for most of their lives, so I think it does matter. So I it's partially true, but But I thought it was a very glib and silly thing to say on the day that, you know, everybody's getting exams. On the main point, let me just say, the countries which overwhelmingly top Virtually every big global education survey you see are Canada, Finland, South Korea, and I'll tell you the one that's coming Big time on the rails is Estonia. And they're all different, but if I can think of 3 things that I think they really drive through their system, 1 is no segregation, whether that's by class, whether that's by private public, whether that's by grammar, they all tend to want to go to the same schools. The second thing, which I think is the most important, is that they really value teachers, and that is not just reflected in pay. And the other thing is that those teachers are not on a totally constant treadmill of exams and inspection. And the third thing is there's some strong system of local oversight. And I think there are things that we've weakened. Tell us all about the local oversight. So it's not all done from the center. It's more devolved down to the local authority. Yeah. The local authorities have real power. They're properly funded from the center, but then there's real local oversight of of of schools. And I think that we have got our system much More centralized than it used to be. But I think this point about teachers is fundamental. You know, we do seem to have had, over the last few years in particular, A sense of government and the educational sort of authorities being at war with teachers, and I just think it's not the way to go. Teachers have got to be valued in a way that at the moment or not. So I think that's the answer to James's question. Those countries which value their teachers make everybody feel ownership of the schools that they go to. I I think Canada and Finland in particular I don't know about South Korea, but Canada and Finland, there is virtually no private education market at all because they know that they can go to good Schools. Every knows they can go to good state schools. So there's no point paying a lot of money if you can get a good education anyway. Yeah. I agree with you. So what did politics teach you about yourself? Amy Gandon, what did you most learn about your own character during your time in politics? What positive and what negative traits did it bring out in you? Oh lord. And any more of 1 than the other? It definitely brought down my obsessiveness. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think there were times where it was good, and there were times where it was bad. I think it definitely played into my Sense of tribalism? Although you would argue I still have a lot of that, I can tell you I have a lot less than I used to. I think it made me quite intolerant at times. I think it made me I often and I still have this I often We'll analyze something and see a problem so clearly that I just cannot understand why people don't other people don't see it the same way. And that is always a mistake in politics. What about you? So I found politics very, very damaging, very damaging for my kind of body, mind, and soul. I think it's A world that doesn't really encourage stepping back and having the space for critical thinking. But I also learnt The flip side of that, which is I learnt my weakness, which is too much of a tendency to get into the details of things. I became a better minister When I was able to really boil down my thinking to a simple position, a clear simple position, And, initially, I sort of slightly despised that, but I realized that, actually, it was moments when I was able to say, for example, in prisons, I will resign unless I bring violence down in a year. Simple statement like that really gave me the kind of entry point into doing the kind of things that I wanted, so it's a very, very strange profession though. I think it's, It's not just social media. I think the whole emphasis on campaigning, the whole style of political argument pushes against what we need, which is careful, Thoughtful policy analysis. So I found it very, very difficult. But in a way, you're saying that that was because that is your character, and your character didn't change. And that's why you found it difficult because that's maybe not a bad thing. So, no, I think parts of my character probably did change. I probably became a bit more fragile, Cure, a bit more needy. I mean, after 5 years on the backbenches, I began to notice to my eternal shame that I was sending kinda creepy texts to David Cameron Congratulating him on his latest speech in the hope that he might promote me. Oh, right. Okay. I see. Okay. So that is not you. Yeah. That that I did not think was me. No. I I went in thinking I was a pretty kinda independent, secure Figure. And I sort of stood up to Cameron, and I disagreed, and I rebelled, you know, big folk about the Hasselords, and I tried to Chart my own course. And then as the years rolled on and I found myself stuck in the horror of the backbenches, I began to Discovered this more creepy ambition emerging, which made me pretty ashamed of myself. My book has been about trying to get people involved in politics. I hope you don't sort of go around the country. Willie Wilo used to say stirring up apathy. Stirring up apathy. He used to say that was he used to say that was his job was to go out of the country stirring up apathy. My my great theory is that the way to change is to make people stare really hard at the problem, be brutally honest And their analysis is the problem, and that's actually the way to make things improve. Yeah. Well, I hope I hope you're right. Here we are. This is also really about politics and and how is Edward Gauthier. I've just reread, obviously a Tory rereads books, Marie Leconte's great book about gossip at Westminster. To what extent do you think gossip is a good or bad part of Westminster? How much did it factor into your daily roles there? I mean, the place was just full of gossip. It was really, really disturbing. One of the things that made me sad is highly intelligent colleagues, and, you know, whatever you thought of them, People like Quasi Quarteng had a big brain, but it was impossible to get them to be serious. It was impossible to get them to sit down and talk in detail about policy. The whole culture of the thing was about offhand jokes, gossip, sitting in the tea rooms, looking at the newspapers, seeing which Scandal had hit another colleague gossiping about who was being promoted and who was going down the hall, and the culture of the journalists too, the lobby, was basically not really about taking Ideas, Siraseel. The integrity of individual Siraseel. It was all about who's up and who's down. What was your experience? I absolutely hate gossip. I don't really see that as gossip. What I hate, and there's a lot of it in politics, is when stories develop about people And nobody knows whether they're true or not and no but nobody really cares because it's just gossip. Now I I fell victim to some of those. I I remember this story when I think about I've told you this story about a story went around that I was having this affair with the Tory MP's secretary. No. And it went it was everywhere. It was like, you know, and I sort of started to see people looking at me differently and wink, wink, and all that sort of stuff. And it was like And I saw her, and said, do I say anything or don't I? And it was completely untrue. Now I had loads of stuff thrown at me all the time, so it didn't really bother me that much, but It bothered the woman a lot, and she, I think, found it very, very difficult to deal with it. And then there's other sorts of gossip. I often think about Leon Britton, The stories that went round about him that were just truly horrible. I used to hear people say, well, you know, no smoke without fire. No smoke without fire. But it was gossip. No. No. It's completely horrible. I so I I had the same. So I I had, a story that was put in the newspapers and was reported in the newspapers from an a spreadsheet put out on the sexual misdemeanours of Conservative MPs. And my name was listed with the name of my parliamentary assistant. So it said Rory Stewart, and then the name of the parliamentary assistant, and I'll repeat her name on this, but Royce Huert asked his assistant to do odd things. I literally, I have no idea what this was. I mean, maybe she had complained to someone in the canteen that I'd asked her to go out and get sushi or something, but the implication was clearly some kind of weird sexual activity. And, Of course, I was, you know, I was a married man. I had kids. And for her, unbelievably shaming and embarrassing to have her name and I was being attacked the same time actually as Dominic Raab, and I said to the conservatives at the time, I'm gonna go out and challenge this. I'm gonna go straight in the media and say complete nonsense thing I put out in a Twitter statement. And I was under huge pressure from the media operation, number 10, to do nothing. I can see that. Why? Well, because because what happens is that if you do it, then everybody else would be expected to do it. And, of course, they can only do it if it's not true. No. That would be the thing. That would be the thing. So the ones that said, you know, so and so and so and so, you know, you can't walk by him without him pinching your I remember the document, by the way. Yeah. You remember the document. Yeah. You'll be pleased to know that I don't remember you being in it because there were far worse offenders. I guess even I, or something like that, Would look at that and think I'd I'd immediately see political advantage, and that's again something that's wrong with politics, as opposed to, Oh, shit. This could happen to us. So the first thing thing is how disingenuous the press team were. They didn't say to me what I'm sure is true that that was It was the reason they were doing it. They said, oh, no. No. You'll cause yourself more trouble if you put out a statement. It'll just it'll just make more a story. I put out a statement. I completely ignored them, put out a statement on my website, put out a statement on Twitter, killed the story instantly. Nobody mentioned me again. Everybody else continued to be in a morass of problems And allegations because some of these allegations you say were true, but- Were true. It was a real kind of reminder of the weirdness of completely unfair, Humiliating gossip and then your own party preventing you from getting out and clearing it up. And I completely agree with you. Everybody reading that would have been like, well, no smoke without a fire. I mean, really, would you say that about Rory if he hadn't done something weird? It can't actually be that he's asking to go out and get sushi. Right? And it's named her name, so she had to put out a statement as well saying, you know, Rory, I promise, did not do anything weird to me, but did I pressure her to put out that statement? I mean, you know, once you start it, where does it end? The thing about gossip, the got it. It's so corrosive. And, of course, it's so tempting in politics. If you can get a rumor going that, you know, somebody's up to no good, or you get a rumor going that you know is going to affect them psychologically, or affect their private life, affect their home life, or whatever, It's so tempting to do. Now I think I'm, you know, I I I was pretty good because I do hate it. I really do hate it. But I've got to be honest, there were there probably were times when if there was a rumour flying around, you sort of let it fly, I guess. But it's pretty horrible. It is horrible. It is. It's horrible stuff. Yeah. Right. Rory, let's have a quick break. I'm Elise Hu. And I'm Josh Klein, and we're the hosts of Built for Change, a podcast from Accenture.

Rehearsals for the school play were really coming along Bigger smile, mister squirrel. Until a custodian accidentally threw away the costumes. Oh, no. Everyone was rattled. Miss Garrity forgot how to play, and the queen of the hedgehogs almost quit. Find a new queen. But replacement costumes were shipped with FedEx. And with added peace of mind from picture proof of delivery, everyone could focus on the perfect opening night. FedEx, where now meets next, for residential delivery only. Now here we are, Rory. Question for Rory. This is from Holly and the EV. Can you envisage yourself Being part of a 1 nation Tory revival following a conservative loss in next year's general election. Question for both of us, is a 1 nation Tory revival even possible in today's Conservative Party? This is something I think about every day. If I felt that a 1 nation revival was possible in the Conservative Party, I would be standing for election at the next election, but honestly, I don't. I don't recognize my own party at the moment. I fear that when they come out of the next election, They will be taken over by Suella Braverman or someone on the right, and that if somebody like me were to stand again And try to lead the conservative party back to the center ground. I would find myself in a very weird isolated position. I'd feel like Mitt Romney Trying to challenge the Republican Party or Liz Cheney, that actually the party is now seized by conservative party members who are very, very far to the rights of people like me and are deeply suspicious. See us as traitors, see us as remainers. Would you get selected in Penrith? It's an interesting question. I don't know. I didn't stand. So, Alsula, you said, why do we never do good news? And, you've found good news in Guatemala where an anti corruption candidate's won. But he's an interesting case as somebody who got, I think, 11% of the vote in the 1st round, made it through the 2nd round of presidential election won. I think that if I had run to be mayor of London as an independent this year, I might have had a hope under the old electoral system because it used to be like the French presidential system, If I could come second to Sadiq Khan, 1st round ahead of the Tory, I'd be able to win possibly in the 2nd round, but that's been changed back to a 1st past the post system. And one of the problems, I think, of our Current system is that our parties have quite a sclerotic grip, and I feel that it would be pretty difficult, difficult to win as an independent anywhere. Maybe Penrith would have been different, but pretty difficult in most places to win any kind of conservative association at the moment. But if you say it right so let's take this guy in Guatemala, Bernardo Arevalo. So as you say, he starts from a low base, and he ends up winning. And he does it on a absolutely on an anti corruption state of politics. Look at the hell of us. We've got to clean this up, and he wins. So what you're doing in a way is you're saying, okay. The Tories are gonna lose, you think. Something like Sohail Rodman's gonna come in. Therefore, there's no place for me, okay, and for your sort of politics. But what that means is The the Conservative Party just keeps going in the same direction. Is there not a case for people like you, David Gawk, etcetera, trying to get back in, So is that eventually, the penny drops and the and the conservative party goes back to being something more sane and sensible or moves into something completely different. There's a total case for it, but if you put in an American example, it would be it feels to me a bit like saying to a republican, why don't get in and try to turn the Republican Party away from Trump. And and when you put it in those terms, it seems kind of absurd. It doesn't seem credible that Liz Cheney or Mitt Romney are gonna turn that Machine around. And I don't get how you do it. I mean, David Gorka and I tried. I obviously ran for the leadership trying to imagine a different type of conservative party, and we ended up Just being thrown out of the party, thrown out of parliament, so I think it's pretty tough. I think it's possible that if they Goes through an experience like they did in 97 where, you know, they lurched the right eventually under Ian Duncan Smith and came back towards the centre. Then Somebody like me could reengage and maybe be part of a broader movement with a team that could try to make the case for 1 nation conservatism again, but It feels pretty bleak. And to be honest, I'm not getting very friendly signals. You know? I don't I'm not in a world in which number 10 is reaching out to people like me. No. Okay. I can I can see that? Now can I ask you a question where you have to defend me? Yeah. Yes. Delighted to do that. We're gonna you defend me whatever I do? Yeah. Whatever you've done, I always defend you. Sean Dexter says this. I'm just getting over seeing red mist During Alastair's dogmatic rant during the small boats discussion. Well, no. It wasn't a discussion at all, was it? Rory was trying to explore a new idea for addressing the problem, and Alastair bumping his gums was not really adding value. Sure. I do love the phrase bumping his gums, I wasn't unreasonable, was I? No. I think you had a very, very passionate case you wanted to make, and you wanted to keep the focus on your central point, which is that you thought the government was being outrageous on this issue, and you want to land a point that you thought I wasn't accepting or listening to, Which is you wanted me to acknowledge that Rishi Sunak and his government are turning the small boats issue purely into political weaponization. So we were disagreeing agreeably. And you thought that I was trying to change the subject onto the rights and wrongs of immigration and asylum policy. And in fact, actually, there was trusting email from one of your defenders that you forwarded to me who took exactly the opposite view. Obviously, I'm extremely pleased by the man with a bump in the gums Because although I signed up to defend you, I'm obviously more on my side than yours, but here's the other side of the argument. Finally, some feeling, even anger from Alistair on small boats. Of course, it ended in agreeable disagreement because that is the nature of the trip beast, albeit highly enjoyable, sometimes education, occasionally even riveting. Rory just doesn't seem able to not defend the government at the same time as castigating them. Excellent. Incidentally, some thoughts on very good. Am I the only one who finds it intensely irritating every time the words are spoken? So I conclude it's to do with the fact that Rory's found a way of stopping the conversation every time his small c conservative argument is on the threshold of being ripped to shreds. It doesn't help my mood. This is clearly straight out of the Etonian debating society playbook, a tactic which also seems to fall for each time. Who was this wonderful person? Well, you you you forward it on to me. Yes. I know. But it was his name. We have we have to give this person the name. Steve Tall, 53. Good old Steve. Good old Steve. Let's be honest. You do do that with very good, don't you? Very good. You do? Very good. Whenever I'm really getting steamed at you, just go, very good, and move on. Very good. So let's, let's move on. Alright. Well, this one. James Ferguson. Do Rory and Alastair think outdoor residential learning should be part of our curriculum for young people? And is there a chance of it happening with the emergence of outdoor education bills by Liz Smith, who I think is a Tory in Scotland. Wonderful Tory in Scotland. I've actually often see her climbing Monroes. Sam Rollins in Wales and Tim Farren in Westminster. Tim Farren, my neighbor in Cumbria, who's a great Fell runner. Have we got 3 outdoor education bills coming forward in the Welsh, Scottish, and UK parlance? I think outdoor residential learning is bloody brilliant. There's actually quite a good system that's been set up for this with some cross party support, which it'd be interesting to see whether governments will continue to support, Which is national citizen service, which at the core of which is basically outward bound, and it's targeted particularly at getting mixed groups of people, many of them from deprived backgrounds. It's an option to go out, spend a few weeks learning personal life skills, good for the economy of the Lake District because often seems to happen around places like Ullswater, but, of course, it is expensive, And I think the challenge for anyone running an education policy is how do you balance the very, very good things? I mean, it's amazing what people get From that experience, if you've not done it before, it's genuinely life changing. But, of course, you know, it can cost 100 of 1,000,000 of pounds a year to fund it properly, And there's so many other demands in education. Yeah. But, you know, they found millions and millions and millions and millions to give to their mates on COVID, didn't they? That's right. All they gotta do is shake that money tree a bit more. Conner, here's question for you. You'll like this one because it won't make you remotely defensive. There's no way at all this question will irritate you at all. Here we go. Okay. Yeah. Maison Gladys, how much damage Is the perception that Peter Mandelson is heavily influencing starma strategy doing to Labour's election prospects? Well, not at all defensively. In my experience, when people talk about a perception, they're talking about something that is being created by enemies who can't quite find the truth for themselves. In other words, Mason Gladys Doesn't know that Peter Mandelson is influencing Starmer's strategy or not, may occasionally read it in newspapers probably quite hostile to Keir Starmer. So that's my answer to that question. Very good. Not at all defensive. No. That was good. That was calm. That was cool. Yep. My question is for Phil Davis. As you are both exceptional linguists, Flattery will get you everywhere everywhere, Phil, Would you ever consider learning Welsh? I actually speak a bit Welsh. You know? Do you? Don't give us a bit of Welsh. Well, I speak what I call Traffic Welsh. John, give us a bit of Traffic Welsh then. Well, Araf. Do you know what Araf means? No. What does Araf mean? I'll give you a clue. Just before you're going around a bend, You'll often see the word Araf written on the road. What do you think it means? Slow down. Slow. Slow. Yeah. Hedlu. I I don't know what our pronunciations lie, but Hedlu. Do you know Hedlu? No. What's that? You see Hedlu a lot. That's police. Go on then. Service station. Service station. Services. I'd love to learn more Welsh. I mean, it was it's important to me because it was the language of Cumbria. I mean, obviously, the word Cumbria is It's Cymru. It's the for for the Welsh nation. And one of the things that's really offends me about signage in Southern Scotland at the moment Is it's in Gaelic. It says, Fotego alba, which is completely bizarre because nobody in Southern Scotland ever spoke Irish, Scottish, Gaelic. It's complete historical nonsense. What they spoke was Welsh Gaelic. So in fact, the sign should say, Criseu y Comru. Or you could have both. Roy, I think you're slightly missing the point here. What do I miss your point, Bert? Well, because very few people speak Gaelic in southern Scotland in in the borders. Historically, nobody ever did. It was not a Gaelic speaking part of the country. There are few schools there now. But, anyway, what it's doing is and Bill either Welsh do. They want to be proud of having their own language. I think you're making it quite a small part of history. Tree. Now there may be a massive outcry against me saying that. Yeah. There will be a huge outcry because people will point out Ahenor Gled, the old north, was this enormous Welsh civilization dominating Southern Scotland and Northern England. And that's where the Gedodden comes from and the famous Welsh lullaby, which is all about Derwent water. Oh god. You can't put this all on. Look. You're talking about a flag and a 3 words on a board, Rory, as you cross the border. You can't have this whole bloody story there. Here's a question for you. How many letters are there in the Welsh alphabet? Oh, I don't know. What's the answer to that? 29. 29. What are the lang letters that we don't have? Oh, I don't know. And they've got 7 vowels. Oh, gosh. Well, I mean, we should interview another Welsh MP. One of the things I loved it's a enough thing to say, but I loved Walking into the cloakrooms of the House of Commons and hearing the Welsh MPs talk to each other. Speaking Welsh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here we are. Anna Curry, do you think the September cabinet reshuffle still on. Do you have any predictions? I used to hate reshuffle speculation stories. We had a couple of ministers who We'll give them, like, dozens of different jobs depending on which paper you read. My advice to all of our listeners in any story about reshuffle is don't believe it. Because even if it's true, they probably don't know that a true. And and is is it is it ambitious MPs leaking out their own names? I mean, is it basically people close to journalists saying, I, This trusts whoever unlikely to be getting a job. No. I think it's more there'll be a bit of that, but I think it's more the by the way, I think we can rule that out. But I think it's more we're going back to the point earlier about the discussion about gossip, is that journalists go over lunch with ministers, and they all sort of talk up A few people talk down, a few people say things like, God almighty, you should see so you know, eyes rolling every time Teresa Coffee opens their mouth. And oh, okay. Tickets. And I honestly do think some of it is based on stuff as basic and simple and useless and stupid as that. The worst thing about reshuffle stories, Two things. The first is, the ministers think they're real. So when it says, you know, Downing Street think that so and so is actually really useless, Downing Street thinks that so and so is absolutely brilliant, that minister reads it and thinks, oh, that must be true, when 9 times Brilliant. That minister reads it and thinks, oh, that must be true, when 9 times out of 10, it won't be. It would have just been made up or kind of, you know, dressed up, flammed up with the sort of the touch of the Downing Street bit. And the other thing it does is it it really kind of undermines the effectiveness of of a minister inside a department where people sit around thinking, well, they're not gonna be here very long. We don't have to worry about them too much. So it's not very good for good government. Well, I was really struck by how good people like Liz Truss and Priti Patel were in the early Cameron Harris, making sure that they saw a lot of journalists, and that their names were always in the center of these conversations. And weirdly, number 10 responded positively to that. I remember number 10 saying, well, you know, one of the reasons we're promoting them is they're such good media performance. And, actually, Liz Truss and Pretty Patel are not particularly exceptional media performers. I wouldn't have thought. Well, I'd say Liz Truss is exceptionally bad. But that was the line, and the line was really created by her proximity to journalists. Right. Last question from you. My last question is from James, and it's for you, Rory. What amazing story do you have regarding governance and sustainability that really brought out the key fundamentals of governments while maintaining high levels of sustainability. Blimey. That's good. That's, I hope, a joke question on the fact that I keep grumbling about the words governance and sustainability. Because I think the point that we're getting out of that is that you can cut that question about 9 different ways because because sustainability could mean environmental sustainability, financial sustainability. I mean, the whole thing is drives me around the room, but a more serious Question is the only thing I ever did in that era, which I was remotely proud of, was introducing the plastic bag tax. I put 5 p on your plastic bags, which reduce the number of plastic bags by some billions. Well done. Just on the words thing, though, are there any words outside politics that you hate? If I were to tell you, for example, that I If somebody says the word portion anywhere near me, it's like polystyrene on glass. It's a weird word, isn't it? It's got a nasty feeling, hasn't it? I hate it. But are there any words like that that you don't like? No. I but then you're more musical than me, but I can see that's a very unpleasant word, the p o r t I o n word. I've got I've got quite a lot of words that I don't like being said nearly, but That's probably number 1. Portion actually does something physical to me. Yeah. I can sense that. I can feel that. Right. Well, I'll try to avoid that, but Well, I'm I'm off to learn my Welsh Gaelic so that I can Put a bit of graffiti on the on the sign as I drive through Scotland. Coming to see you. Very good. Alright. Thanks a lot. All the best. Speak soon. Bye bye.",

And, Rory, I wanna start with a an apology to our listeners. When we get things wrong, we always admit to it. And I don't know why I said this because I knew even after I said it, it was wrong. But, anyway, this is from somebody called An Onimus.\n\nAn Onimus? Oh, anonymous. I see. Very, very funny. Anne Oneimus says, you were very poorly informed about the police Service Northern Ireland data breach.\n\nThe release of the data was in response to a freedom of information request. It was not due to a cyber attack. It reportedly went through 5 separate checks before being posted. It should not have been so easy as you suggest. It may not have been an accident.\n\nAnne Oneimus also goes on to point out It's Catholic members of the PSNI who are at risk of a result of this breach as they're considered by someone on the far right nationalist side as treacherous for having joined the force previously infamous as the RUC. 2nd part of that question, fairly loaded, Anne. What's really strange, Rory, after we recorded it, I realized I'd said that, and I knew it was absolute bollocks, but I forgot to phone the production and tell them. So there we are. It went through.\n\nSpeaker 5: Just on this one. So, I mean, I the the BBC's reported on this. So, Potentially, there were 2 breaches. The first breach happened when data was made public in error in response to an FOI request and appeared online for 3 hours last Tuesday, And then a 2nd data breach involving the theft of a spreadsheet with the names of 200 officers and staff emerged the following day. And that, As she says, it's not a cyber breach.\n\nThat was actually the theft of a police issue, laptop and radio from a private vehicle, but it's somebody, a second person, just been arrested by no London police, So taking it very seriously, but it's a reminder to all of us because if you read too quickly these stories that says a major data breach, One's immediate assumption is that it's a cyber attack, not that somebody's releasing it in response to a freedom of information.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I knew because I remember I remember thinking at the time, who on earth would have released that as an FYI? So anyway, slap the wrist for me, and I'm blaming the heat. Now the next one is you, populism in Portugal. Tome Ribeiro Hommes. Rory teases with the Portuguese exception to the populist way, but you ended up not going into it on the podcast.\n\nThe populist Chega party has grown rapidly over its short existence, And indeed it has, Roy. It's now the 3rd political force. And I sorta knew that when you said it, and I thought maybe he knows more than I do here. But, you know, they're going into The European elections, and they're currently at 13.2%, which isn't bad for a, you know, smaller party. They've got 12 seats in parliament.\n\nAnd even though they've got none in the European Parliament, on on that voting, they they gained 3 or 4 seats of Portugal's share in in European Parliament. And they are pretty right wing. I mean, they've they've got similar white supremacists, slightly neo Nazi groups.\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, it's it's definitely true. They do have this party, but Portugal has had a different history to other European countries, and I don't wanna overdo it, but I think that you can make a case that Portugal's been a really remarkable example of moderation. Yeah. You presumably are cheered up by the fact that the 2 main parties are the Socialist Party and the Social Democratic party.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Suarez has done pretty well. I mean, you know so, yeah, they're they're they're a rare success story on the more progressive site.\n\nSpeaker 5: It's worth looking at them. Maybe you should look at them a bit more. So, obviously, Guterres, who's the UN secretary general, was was their leader, Antonio Costa, and now, but people often sort of think about Unless they're just a sort of subset of Spain, but in fact, their historical experience is a bit different. Yes. Like Spain, they were under a dictatorship to the early seventies, But it wasn't a dictatorship that, like Franco's, it wasn't one that tried to crush kinda national identities.\n\nIt didn't have quite the extreme brutality of Franco. They had a much more dramatic transition out of dictatorship. Spain, there were lots of issues that weren't dealt with in the seventies that continue to haunt and you see this through moving Franco's body and stuff. Unlike Spain, they didn't grow into this huge housing bubble And Spain, of course, has massive automobile industry, wind manufacturing, tourism on a one of the largest scales in the world, Whereas Portugal is still very much doing things like manufacturing cork, manufacturing shoes. They're also different because traditionally, A bit like Ireland, which I guess is a maybe a comparable economy in terms of size and scale until it started to grow so quickly, the problem in Portugal wasn't immigration, it was emigration.\n\nPortuguese leaving to go to other countries the way that people do from places like Romania or or Albania. So there wasn't the same Underlying stuff and finally I think in the financial crisis, Spain ended up with nearly 50% youth unemployment and I think their general unemployment rate shot up to nearly twice that of Portugal's. So maybe there haven't been quite the same drivers in Portugal in terms of the 2008 financial crisis, immigration and other things. I mean, they still obviously inherit the problems Social media. They did go through a brutal situation, the financial crisis, their debt, but maybe that's part of the reason why they've they've tended to be more moderate And more centrist in their politics since the seventies.\n\nSpeaker 0: Costa is he's now in his 3rd term, which is pretty rare for any leader these days. But there have been Quite a lot of scandals and resignations in recent months in this 3rd term. I think he's lost double figures now. He's he's lost ministers and secretaries of state, which almost Boris Johnson level, and and partly to do with some issues of corruption and also past conducts. But, you know, I think that you're you're broadly right that we're talking about out a pretty successful progressive government.\n\nWe should thank our eagle ear to Portuguese listener for pointing out that we didn't go back to something that we said We were going to, so thanks for that.\n\nSpeaker 5: Very good. Okay. Next question coming in from Sidharthakare. What are your predictions for For republican primaries, any thoughts on the Reagan oriented Vivek Ramaswamy?\n\nSpeaker 0: Is this the guy that everybody's talking about with the big money coming behind?\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. So Vivek Ramaswamy is Very, very young. I think he's in his late thirties. He is famously kind of fast, eloquent talker. He is an extreme isolationist.\n\nHe seems to want to have America to have almost nothing to do with the world at all. He's, I think, said that if America manages to, get independent with semiconductors, then there's there's no point in defending Taiwan at all. And as Ron DeSantis loses some of his momentum and energy, People are beginning to focus more on Vivek Ramaswami.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I don't know much about him at all, so I'm I'm bound to your superior knowledge on that. Look. I I I feel that unless These legal cases against Trump really do him. I think he's gonna be the candidate. It's not that long ago people were talking about Ron DeSantis as being the great white hope.\n\nAs you said, yesterday, he's virtually vanished. I see Trump's not turning up for the 1st debate. Chris Christie had a wonderful, wonderful put down on him about that, basically saying that he was both useless and a coward. So there are some sort of voices coming out telling the truth about Trump.\n\nSpeaker 5: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: James Thompson, in light of GCSE and a level results, in your well traveled and worldly opinions, which education systems from which country is the most fit for purpose and effective? How should we measure success in schools? We had quite a lot of questions about education this week. Jack Harris, seeing as the education secretary has admitted that a levels and, by extension, exams are pointless in the long term, I was wondering if you could define the point of education. I don't think she was quite Saying that she did say something, I think, rather odd for an education secretary on the day that exams were coming out.\n\nShe said in 10 years' time, nobody will care. I think that is a very odd message for an education segment you put out there.\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I'd I'd defend her for a second because I think one of our questioners actually defended her, didn't they? It is true that by the time you're 10 years into the workplace, people don't pay any attention to what your a levels were.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But is that a sensible thing to say on the day that kids are sweating over their exams? I I just thought it was a very, very odd thing to say.\n\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Even though it's true?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it's true in some regards, but you still have to go in. Particularly in the modern world, people having to apply for jobs for most of their lives, so I think it does matter. So I it's partially true, but But I thought it was a very glib and silly thing to say on the day that, you know, everybody's getting exams. On the main point, let me just say, the countries which overwhelmingly top Virtually every big global education survey you see are Canada, Finland, South Korea, and I'll tell you the one that's coming Big time on the rails is Estonia. And they're all different, but if I can think of 3 things that I think they really drive through their system, 1 is no segregation, whether that's by class, whether that's by private public, whether that's by grammar, they all tend to want to go to the same schools.\n\nThe second thing, which I think is the most important, is that they really value teachers, and that is not just reflected in pay. And the other thing is that those teachers are not on a totally constant treadmill of exams and inspection. And the third thing is there's some strong system of local oversight. And I think there are things that we've weakened.\n\nSpeaker 5: Tell us all about the local oversight. So it's not all done from the center. It's more devolved down to the local authority.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. The local authorities have real power. They're properly funded from the center, but then there's real local oversight of of of schools. And I think that we have got our system much More centralized than it used to be. But I think this point about teachers is fundamental.\n\nYou know, we do seem to have had, over the last few years in particular, A sense of government and the educational sort of authorities being at war with teachers, and I just think it's not the way to go. Teachers have got to be valued in a way that at the moment or not. So I think that's the answer to James's question. Those countries which value their teachers make everybody feel ownership of the schools that they go to. I I think Canada and Finland in particular I don't know about South Korea, but Canada and Finland, there is virtually no private education market at all because they know that they can go to good Schools.\n\nEvery knows they can go to good state schools.\n\nSpeaker 5: So there's no point paying a lot of money if you can get a good education anyway. Yeah. I agree with you. So what did politics teach you about yourself? Amy Gandon, what did you most learn about your own character during your time in politics?\n\nWhat positive and what negative traits did it bring out in you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh lord.\n\nSpeaker 5: And any more of 1 than the other?\n\nSpeaker 0: It definitely brought down my obsessiveness. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think there were times where it was good, and there were times where it was bad. I think it definitely played into my Sense of tribalism? Although you would argue I still have a lot of that, I can tell you I have a lot less than I used to.\n\nI think it made me quite intolerant at times. I think it made me I often and I still have this I often We'll analyze something and see a problem so clearly that I just cannot understand why people don't other people don't see it the same way. And that is always a mistake in politics. What about you?\n\nSpeaker 5: So I found politics very, very damaging, very damaging for my kind of body, mind, and soul. I think it's A world that doesn't really encourage stepping back and having the space for critical thinking. But I also learnt The flip side of that, which is I learnt my weakness, which is too much of a tendency to get into the details of things. I became a better minister When I was able to really boil down my thinking to a simple position, a clear simple position, And, initially, I sort of slightly despised that, but I realized that, actually, it was moments when I was able to say, for example, in prisons, I will resign unless I bring violence down in a year. Simple statement like that really gave me the kind of entry point into doing the kind of things that I wanted, so it's a very, very strange profession though.\n\nI think it's, It's not just social media. I think the whole emphasis on campaigning, the whole style of political argument pushes against what we need, which is careful, Thoughtful policy analysis. So I found it very, very difficult.\n\nSpeaker 0: But in a way, you're saying that that was because that is your character, and your character didn't change. And that's why you found it difficult because that's maybe not a bad thing.\n\nSpeaker 5: So, no, I think parts of my character probably did change. I probably became a bit more fragile, Cure, a bit more needy. I mean, after 5 years on the backbenches, I began to notice to my eternal shame that I was sending kinda creepy texts to David Cameron Congratulating him on his latest speech in the hope that he might promote me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, right. Okay. I see. Okay. So that is not you.\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. That that I did not think was me. No. I I went in thinking I was a pretty kinda independent, secure Figure. And I sort of stood up to Cameron, and I disagreed, and I rebelled, you know, big folk about the Hasselords, and I tried to Chart my own course.\n\nAnd then as the years rolled on and I found myself stuck in the horror of the backbenches, I began to Discovered this more creepy ambition emerging, which made me pretty ashamed of myself.\n\nSpeaker 0: My book has been about trying to get people involved in politics. I hope you don't sort of go around the country. Willie Wilo used to say stirring up apathy.\n\nSpeaker 5: Stirring up apathy. He used\n\nSpeaker 0: to say that was he used to say that was his job was to go out of the country stirring up apathy.\n\nSpeaker 5: My my great theory is that the way to change is to make people stare really hard at the problem, be brutally honest And their analysis is the problem, and that's actually the way to make things improve.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, I hope I hope you're right. Here we are. This is also really about politics and and how is Edward Gauthier. I've just reread, obviously a Tory rereads books, Marie Leconte's great book about gossip at Westminster.\n\nTo what extent do you think gossip is a good or bad part of Westminster? How much did it factor into your daily roles there?\n\nSpeaker 5: I mean, the place was just full of gossip. It was really, really disturbing. One of the things that made me sad is highly intelligent colleagues, and, you know, whatever you thought of them, People like Quasi Quarteng had a big brain, but it was impossible to get them to be serious. It was impossible to get them to sit down and talk in detail about policy. The whole culture of the thing was about offhand jokes, gossip, sitting in the tea rooms, looking at the newspapers, seeing which Scandal had hit another colleague gossiping about who was being promoted and who was going down the hall, and the culture of the journalists too, the lobby, was basically not really about taking Ideas, Siraseel.\n\nThe integrity of individual Siraseel. It was all about who's up and who's down. What was your experience?\n\nSpeaker 0: I absolutely hate gossip. I don't really see that as gossip. What I hate, and there's a lot of it in politics, is when stories develop about people And nobody knows whether they're true or not and no but nobody really cares because it's just gossip. Now I I fell victim to some of those. I I remember this story when I think about I've told you this story about a story went around that I was having this affair with the Tory MP's secretary.\n\nSpeaker 5: No.\n\nSpeaker 0: And it went it was everywhere. It was like, you know, and I sort of started to see people looking at me differently and wink, wink, and all that sort of stuff. And it was like And I saw her, and said, do I say anything or don't I? And it was completely untrue. Now I had loads of stuff thrown at me all the time, so it didn't really bother me that much, but It bothered the woman a lot, and she, I think, found it very, very difficult to deal with it.\n\nAnd then there's other sorts of gossip. I often think about Leon Britton, The stories that went round about him that were just truly horrible. I used to hear people say, well, you know, no smoke without fire. No smoke without fire. But it was gossip.\n\nSpeaker 5: No. No. It's completely horrible. I so I I had the same. So I I had, a story that was put in the newspapers and was reported in the newspapers from an a spreadsheet put out on the sexual misdemeanours of Conservative MPs.\n\nAnd my name was listed with the name of my parliamentary assistant. So it said Rory Stewart, and then the name of the parliamentary assistant, and I'll repeat her name on this, but Royce Huert asked his assistant to do odd things. I literally, I have no idea what this was. I mean, maybe she had complained to someone in the canteen that I'd asked her to go out and get sushi or something, but the implication was clearly some kind of weird sexual activity. And, Of course, I was, you know, I was a married man.\n\nI had kids. And for her, unbelievably shaming and embarrassing to have her name and I was being attacked the same time actually as Dominic Raab, and I said to the conservatives at the time, I'm gonna go out and challenge this. I'm gonna go straight in the media and say complete nonsense thing I put out in a Twitter statement. And I was under huge pressure from the media operation, number 10, to do nothing.\n\nSpeaker 0: I can see that. Why? Well, because because what happens is that if you do it, then everybody else would be expected to do it. And, of course, they can only do it if it's not true. No.\n\nThat would be the thing. That would be the thing. So the ones that said, you know, so and so and so and so, you know, you can't walk by him without him pinching your I remember the document, by the way. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: You remember the document. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: You'll be pleased to know that I don't remember you being in it because there were far worse offenders. I guess even I, or something like that, Would look at that and think I'd I'd immediately see political advantage, and that's again something that's wrong with politics, as opposed to, Oh, shit. This could happen to us.\n\nSpeaker 5: So the first thing thing is how disingenuous the press team were. They didn't say to me what I'm sure is true that that was It was the reason they were doing it. They said, oh, no. No. You'll cause yourself more trouble if you put out a statement.\n\nIt'll just it'll just make more a story. I put out a statement. I completely ignored them, put out a statement on my website, put out a statement on Twitter, killed the story instantly. Nobody mentioned me again. Everybody else continued to be in a morass of problems And allegations because some of these allegations you say were true, but- Were true.\n\nIt was a real kind of reminder of the weirdness of completely unfair, Humiliating gossip and then your own party preventing you from getting out and clearing it up. And I completely agree with you. Everybody reading that would have been like, well, no smoke without a fire. I mean, really, would you say that about Rory if he hadn't done something weird? It can't actually be that he's asking to go out and get sushi.\n\nRight? And it's named her name, so she had to put out a statement as well saying, you know, Rory, I promise, did not do anything weird to me, but did I pressure her to put out that statement? I mean, you know, once you start it, where does it end?\n\nSpeaker 0: The thing about gossip, the got it. It's so corrosive. And, of course, it's so tempting in politics. If you can get a rumor going that, you know, somebody's up to no good, or you get a rumor going that you know is going to affect them psychologically, or affect their private life, affect their home life, or whatever, It's so tempting to do. Now I think I'm, you know, I I I was pretty good because I do hate it.\n\nI really do hate it. But I've got to be honest, there were there probably were times when if there was a rumour flying around, you sort of let it fly, I guess. But it's pretty horrible. It is horrible.\n\nSpeaker 5: It is. It's horrible stuff.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Right. Rory, let's have a quick break.\n\nSpeaker 3: I'm Elise Hu.\n\nSpeaker 4: And I'm Josh Klein, and we're the hosts of Built for Change, a podcast from Accenture.\n\nSpeaker 3: On Built for Change, we're talking to business leaders from every corner of the world that are harnessing change to reinvent the future of their business.\n\nSpeaker 4: We're discussing ideas like the importance of ethical AI or how productivity soars when companies truly listen to what their employees value.\n\nSpeaker 3: These are insights that leaders need to know to stay ahead.\n\nSpeaker 4: So subscribe to Built for Change wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nSpeaker 6: Rehearsals for the school play were really coming along\n\nSpeaker 5: Bigger smile, mister squirrel.\n\nSpeaker 6: Until a custodian accidentally threw away the costumes.\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, no.\n\nSpeaker 6: Everyone was rattled. Miss Garrity forgot how to play, and the queen of the hedgehogs almost quit.\n\nSpeaker 3: Find a new queen.\n\nSpeaker 6: But replacement costumes were shipped with FedEx. And with added peace of mind from picture proof of delivery, everyone could focus on the perfect opening night. FedEx, where now meets next, for residential delivery only.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now here we are, Rory. Question for Rory. This is from Holly and the EV. Can you envisage yourself Being part of a 1 nation Tory revival following a conservative loss in next year's general election. Question for both of us, is a 1 nation Tory revival even possible in today's Conservative Party?\n\nSpeaker 5: This is something I think about every day. If I felt that a 1 nation revival was possible in the Conservative Party, I would be standing for election at the next election, but honestly, I don't. I don't recognize my own party at the moment. I fear that when they come out of the next election, They will be taken over by Suella Braverman or someone on the right, and that if somebody like me were to stand again And try to lead the conservative party back to the center ground. I would find myself in a very weird isolated position.\n\nI'd feel like Mitt Romney Trying to challenge the Republican Party or Liz Cheney, that actually the party is now seized by conservative party members who are very, very far to the rights of people like me and are deeply suspicious. See us as traitors, see us as remainers.\n\nSpeaker 0: Would you get selected in Penrith?\n\nSpeaker 5: It's an interesting question. I don't know. I didn't stand. So, Alsula, you said, why do we never do good news? And, you've found good news in Guatemala where an anti corruption candidate's won.\n\nBut he's an interesting case as somebody who got, I think, 11% of the vote in the 1st round, made it through the 2nd round of presidential election won. I think that if I had run to be mayor of London as an independent this year, I might have had a hope under the old electoral system because it used to be like the French presidential system, If I could come second to Sadiq Khan, 1st round ahead of the Tory, I'd be able to win possibly in the 2nd round, but that's been changed back to a 1st past the post system. And one of the problems, I think, of our Current system is that our parties have quite a sclerotic grip, and I feel that it would be pretty difficult, difficult to win as an independent anywhere. Maybe Penrith would have been different, but pretty difficult in most places to win any kind of conservative association at the moment.\n\nSpeaker 0: But if you say it right so let's take this guy in Guatemala, Bernardo Arevalo. So as you say, he starts from a low base, and he ends up winning. And he does it on a absolutely on an anti corruption state of politics. Look at the hell of us. We've got to clean this up, and he wins.\n\nSo what you're doing in a way is you're saying, okay. The Tories are gonna lose, you think. Something like Sohail Rodman's gonna come in. Therefore, there's no place for me, okay, and for your sort of politics. But what that means is The the Conservative Party just keeps going in the same direction.\n\nIs there not a case for people like you, David Gawk, etcetera, trying to get back in, So is that eventually, the penny drops and the and the conservative party goes back to being something more sane and sensible or moves into something completely different.\n\nSpeaker 5: There's a total case for it, but if you put in an American example, it would be it feels to me a bit like saying to a republican, why don't get in and try to turn the Republican Party away from Trump. And and when you put it in those terms, it seems kind of absurd. It doesn't seem credible that Liz Cheney or Mitt Romney are gonna turn that Machine around. And I don't get how you do it. I mean, David Gorka and I tried.\n\nI obviously ran for the leadership trying to imagine a different type of conservative party, and we ended up Just being thrown out of the party, thrown out of parliament, so I think it's pretty tough. I think it's possible that if they Goes through an experience like they did in 97 where, you know, they lurched the right eventually under Ian Duncan Smith and came back towards the centre. Then Somebody like me could reengage and maybe be part of a broader movement with a team that could try to make the case for 1 nation conservatism again, but It feels pretty bleak. And to be honest, I'm not getting very friendly signals. You know?\n\nI don't I'm not in a world in which number 10 is reaching out to people like me.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. Okay. I can I can see that? Now can I ask you a question where you have to defend me?\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Yes. Delighted to do that.\n\nSpeaker 0: We're gonna you defend me whatever I do?\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Whatever you've done, I\n\nSpeaker 0: always defend you. Sean Dexter says this. I'm just getting over seeing red mist During Alastair's dogmatic rant during the small boats discussion. Well, no. It wasn't a discussion at all, was it?\n\nRory was trying to explore a new idea for addressing the problem, and Alastair bumping his gums was not really adding value. Sure. I do love the phrase bumping his gums, I wasn't unreasonable, was I?\n\nSpeaker 5: No. I think you had a very, very passionate case you wanted to make, and you wanted to keep the focus on your central point, which is that you thought the government was being outrageous on this issue, and you want to land a point that you thought I wasn't accepting or listening to, Which is you wanted me to acknowledge that Rishi Sunak and his government are turning the small boats issue purely into political weaponization.\n\nSpeaker 0: So we were disagreeing agreeably.\n\nSpeaker 5: And you thought that I was trying to change the subject onto the rights and wrongs of immigration and asylum policy. And in fact, actually, there was trusting email from one of your defenders that you forwarded to me who took exactly the opposite view. Obviously, I'm extremely pleased by the man with a bump in the gums Because although I signed up to defend you, I'm obviously more on my side than yours, but here's the other side of the argument. Finally, some feeling, even anger from Alistair on small boats. Of course, it ended in agreeable disagreement because that is the nature of the trip beast, albeit highly enjoyable, sometimes education, occasionally even riveting.\n\nRory just doesn't seem able to not defend the government at the same time as castigating them.\n\nSpeaker 0: Excellent.\n\nSpeaker 5: Incidentally, some thoughts on very good. Am I the only one who finds it intensely irritating every time the words are spoken? So I conclude it's to do with the fact that Rory's found a way of stopping the conversation every time his small c conservative argument is on the threshold of being ripped to shreds. It doesn't help my mood. This is clearly straight out of the Etonian debating society playbook, a tactic which also seems to fall for each time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Who was this wonderful person?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, you you you forward it on to me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. I know. But it was his name. We have we have to give this person the name. Steve Tall, 53.\n\nGood old Steve.\n\nSpeaker 5: Good old Steve. Let's\n\nSpeaker 0: be honest. You do do that with very good, don't you?\n\nSpeaker 5: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: You do?\n\nSpeaker 5: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Whenever I'm really getting steamed at you, just go, very good, and move on.\n\nSpeaker 5: Very good. So let's, let's move on.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Well, this one. James Ferguson. Do Rory and Alastair think outdoor residential learning should be part of our curriculum for young people? And is there a chance of it happening with the emergence of outdoor education bills by Liz Smith, who I think is a Tory in Scotland.\n\nSpeaker 5: Wonderful Tory in Scotland. I've actually often see her climbing Monroes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Sam Rollins in Wales and Tim Farren in Westminster.\n\nSpeaker 5: Tim Farren, my neighbor in Cumbria, who's a great Fell runner.\n\nSpeaker 0: Have we got 3 outdoor education bills coming forward in the Welsh, Scottish, and UK parlance? I think outdoor residential learning is bloody brilliant.\n\nSpeaker 5: There's actually quite a good system that's been set up for this with some cross party support, which it'd be interesting to see whether governments will continue to support, Which is national citizen service, which at the core of which is basically outward bound, and it's targeted particularly at getting mixed groups of people, many of them from deprived backgrounds. It's an option to go out, spend a few weeks learning personal life skills, good for the economy of the Lake District because often seems to happen around places like Ullswater, but, of course, it is expensive, And I think the challenge for anyone running an education policy is how do you balance the very, very good things? I mean, it's amazing what people get From that experience, if you've not done it before, it's genuinely life changing. But, of course, you know, it can cost 100 of 1,000,000 of pounds a year to fund it properly, And there's so many other demands in education.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But, you know, they found millions and millions and millions and millions to give to their mates on COVID, didn't they?\n\nSpeaker 5: That's right. All they gotta do is shake that money tree a bit more. Conner, here's question for you. You'll like this one because it won't make you remotely defensive. There's no way at all this question will irritate you at all.\n\nSpeaker 0: Here we go. Okay. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: Maison Gladys, how much damage Is the perception that Peter Mandelson is heavily influencing starma strategy doing to Labour's election prospects?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, not at all defensively. In my experience, when people talk about a perception, they're talking about something that is being created by enemies who can't quite find the truth for themselves. In other words, Mason Gladys Doesn't know that Peter Mandelson is influencing Starmer's strategy or not, may occasionally read it in newspapers probably quite hostile to Keir Starmer. So that's my answer to that question.\n\nSpeaker 5: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Not at all defensive.\n\nSpeaker 5: No. That was good. That was calm. That was cool.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. My question is for Phil Davis. As you are both exceptional linguists, Flattery will get you everywhere everywhere, Phil, Would you ever consider learning Welsh? I actually speak a bit Welsh. You know?\n\nSpeaker 5: Do you? Don't give us a bit of Welsh.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I speak what I call Traffic Welsh.\n\nSpeaker 5: John, give us a bit of Traffic Welsh then.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Araf. Do you know what Araf means?\n\nSpeaker 5: No. What does Araf mean? I'll give you\n\nSpeaker 0: a clue. Just before you're going around a bend, You'll often see the word Araf written on the road. What do you think it means?\n\nSpeaker 5: Slow down. Slow.\n\nSpeaker 0: Slow. Yeah. Hedlu. I I don't know what our pronunciations lie, but Hedlu. Do you know Hedlu?\n\nSpeaker 5: No. What's that?\n\nSpeaker 0: You see Hedlu a lot. That's police.\n\nSpeaker 5: Go on then.\n\nSpeaker 0: Service station. Service station. Services.\n\nSpeaker 5: I'd love to learn more Welsh. I mean, it was it's important to me because it was the language of Cumbria. I mean, obviously, the word Cumbria is It's Cymru. It's the for for the Welsh nation. And one of the things that's really offends me about signage in Southern Scotland at the moment Is it's in Gaelic.\n\nIt says, Fotego alba, which is completely bizarre because nobody in Southern Scotland ever spoke Irish, Scottish, Gaelic. It's complete historical nonsense. What they spoke was Welsh Gaelic. So in fact, the sign should say, Criseu y Comru.\n\nSpeaker 0: Or you could have both. Roy, I think you're slightly missing the point here.\n\nSpeaker 5: What do I miss your point, Bert?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, because very few people speak Gaelic in southern Scotland in in the borders.\n\nSpeaker 5: Historically, nobody ever did. It was not a Gaelic speaking part of the country.\n\nSpeaker 0: There are few schools there now. But, anyway, what it's doing is and Bill either Welsh do. They want to be proud of having their own language. I think you're making it quite a small part of history. Tree.\n\nNow there may be a massive outcry against me saying that.\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. There will be a huge outcry because people will point out Ahenor Gled, the old north, was this enormous Welsh civilization dominating Southern Scotland and Northern England. And that's where the Gedodden comes from and the famous Welsh lullaby, which is all about Derwent water.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh god. You can't put this all on. Look. You're talking about a flag and a 3 words on a board, Rory, as you cross the border. You can't have this whole bloody story there.\n\nHere's a question for you. How many letters are there in the Welsh alphabet?\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, I don't know. What's the answer\n\nSpeaker 0: to that? 29.\n\nSpeaker 5: 29. What are the lang letters that we don't have?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I don't know. And they've got 7 vowels.\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, gosh. Well, I mean, we should interview another Welsh MP. One of the things I loved it's a enough thing to say, but I loved Walking into the cloakrooms of the House of Commons and hearing the Welsh MPs talk to each other.\n\nSpeaker 0: Speaking Welsh.\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here we are.\n\nAnna Curry, do you think the September cabinet reshuffle still on. Do you have any predictions?\n\nSpeaker 0: I used to hate reshuffle speculation stories. We had a couple of ministers who We'll give them, like, dozens of different jobs depending on which paper you read. My advice to all of our listeners in any story about reshuffle is don't believe it. Because even if it's true, they probably don't know that a true.\n\nSpeaker 5: And and is is it is it ambitious MPs leaking out their own names? I mean, is it basically people close to journalists saying, I, This trusts whoever unlikely to be getting a job.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I think it's more there'll be a bit of that, but I think it's more the by the way, I think we can rule that out. But I think it's more we're going back to the point earlier about the discussion about gossip, is that journalists go over lunch with ministers, and they all sort of talk up A few people talk down, a few people say things like, God almighty, you should see so you know, eyes rolling every time Teresa Coffee opens their mouth. And oh, okay. Tickets.\n\nAnd I honestly do think some of it is based on stuff as basic and simple and useless and stupid as that. The worst thing about reshuffle stories, Two things. The first is, the ministers think they're real. So when it says, you know, Downing Street think that so and so is actually really useless, Downing Street thinks that so and so is absolutely brilliant, that minister reads it and thinks, oh, that must be true, when 9 times Brilliant. That minister reads it and thinks, oh, that must be true, when 9 times out of 10, it won't be.\n\nIt would have just been made up or kind of, you know, dressed up, flammed up with the sort of the touch of the Downing Street bit. And the other thing it does is it it really kind of undermines the effectiveness of of a minister inside a department where people sit around thinking, well, they're not gonna be here very long. We don't have to worry about them too much. So it's not very good for good government.\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I was really struck by how good people like Liz Truss and Priti Patel were in the early Cameron Harris, making sure that they saw a lot of journalists, and that their names were always in the center of these conversations. And weirdly, number 10 responded positively to that. I remember number 10 saying, well, you know, one of the reasons we're promoting them is they're such good media performance. And, actually, Liz Truss and Pretty Patel are not particularly exceptional media performers. I wouldn't have thought.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'd say Liz Truss is exceptionally bad.\n\nSpeaker 5: But that was the line, and the line was really created by her proximity to journalists. Right. Last question from you.\n\nSpeaker 0: My last question is from James, and it's for you, Rory. What amazing story do you have regarding governance and sustainability that really brought out the key fundamentals of governments while maintaining high levels of sustainability.\n\nSpeaker 5: Blimey. That's good. That's, I hope, a joke question on the fact that I keep grumbling about the words governance and sustainability. Because I think the point that we're getting out of that is that you can cut that question about 9 different ways because because sustainability could mean environmental sustainability, financial sustainability. I mean, the whole thing is drives me around the room, but a more serious Question is the only thing I ever did in that era, which I was remotely proud of, was introducing the plastic bag tax.\n\nI put 5 p on your plastic bags, which reduce the number of plastic bags by some billions.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well done. Just on the words thing, though, are there any words outside politics that you hate?
