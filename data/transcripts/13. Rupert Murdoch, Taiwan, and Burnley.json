Welcome to the rest of this politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Today, we're gonna be discussing the Australian election results, their wider international impact, and I'm gonna try to see if there's any connection between the teal party in Australia and what we've been trying to do with independence in London. We're gonna talk about Joe Biden's worries about island nations looking to China. And huge thank you to everyone who sent in a question this week. Another 600 questions on Twitter and email. So we'll work our way through as many of those as we can in the second half. Right then, Alisa, I I don't really wanna raise it, but but Burnley. No. You don't wanna raise it, Rory. And and and also, You so don't care, and you so don't know. And it's only a matter of pain to me, so let's just move on. And let's let's start Where we ended last week, which was you saying that lying has to become, more central to our political debate. And lo and behold, here we are recording this on the moment on the morning when Boris Johnson, pictures have emerged of him clearly having party. It's an event for which he was not fined by the Metropolitan Police. And there was a brilliant question from Jason Moore, which was, Why is it a crime to lie in the places where laws are enforced, our courts, but not a crime to lie in the place where our laws are made. I think we now just accept. Do we all accept that Johnson has lied in parliament? 100%. He said clearly again and again that he didn't go to a party, said clearly that no rules were broken. And, clearly, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed the rules are broken, and, clearly, there is evidence that he went to parties. So he's got to resign. He's got to resign. Yeah. And the problem is that the that this goes to the core of why this matters and why does it matter. It matters Just as it does in the law court because there's no way that the public can come to a decision when they vote unless they have the correct information. And And if people are lying to them in parliament, it's really impossible to have a democracy functioning. So we're ending up with the absolute erosion of what holds our democracy together. And it's all down to your colleagues. It's your former colleagues on the Tory backbenches who, it seems to me, are still not facing up to that reality that you just outlined, and that is horrific. And it's extraordinary, isn't it? And it it's odd also how Even people like Charles Walker, who initially said he was gonna go, has now changed his mind and decided that he's come through. Charles Walker did this interview. I think it was with Newsnight where he said he's like some amazing, improbable, heroic cricketer who suddenly comes in at the last moment and takes Five wickets or scores an extraordinary number of runs as though somehow Boris Johnson has presented himself to the public as though not only the rules don't apply to him, not only that he can lie when other people can't, but that Somehow it's all forgiven as though he's some sort of magic exception to the way that everybody else has to behave. But that's I think he's running out of road on that because, I mean, admittedly, going around the place, I'm assuming that the sort of people who come up and talk to me probably either want to abuse me about Iraq Or they agree with me about everything that I say, and that tends to be the the flow. But, you know, you mentioned Burnley up at, Burnley at the weekend, which the Tories sort of view as a homogeneous red wall, etcetera, etcetera. Every single person who with whom I had a discussion about politics, and Johnson was just disgusted by him. And I think that's going deeper and deeper and deeper. And I think the Charles Walkers of this world We're probably thinking, oh, well, if he goes, at least we've got Sunak land lined up. And, of course, Sunak has been utterly torpedoed. So now they're thinking, do we really want let's trust his prime minister, which would be a complete disaster. I think we all know that. So it is literally better the devil, you know, and he happens to be pretty close to being the devil. Yeah. It's well, there's a brilliant article by Hugo Rifkin in The Times, which completely summed up my sense of dealing with him. Hugo Rifkin says, we're all kind of married to him now. And he sits No. I'm not. Let me push the metaphor through. So he sits at the breakfast table. He's sort of smirking at you about his latest infidelity. And either you ignore it, in which case he's won, Or you screech at him about it, in which case he's also 1 because then all his mates are like, yeah. I know. But, of course, he behaves like that because you're always screeching at him. And one of the tricks is he trivializes everything. Yeah. And and and he does it Rifkin said he does it partly sort of bending time. I'd be interested whether you thought this Made sense as a communications expert because Rifkin points out that what he does is he kinda stretches stories out, And, usually, that would be damaging. But in his case, you start a debate going, did Sue Gray set the meeting or did Downing Street That meeting, you stretch it out over 3, 4 days. You force Sophie Ridge on Sky to spend 10 minutes trying to ask Nadim Sahabi who set the calendar in the meeting. And after 4 days when the truth finding comes out, the people asking the questions are made to seem a little bit petty as though they're pushing after a trivial issue because They've had to keep repeating who set the calendar in the diary for 4 days until the public's like, why are you asking about the calendar in the diary? And that's and And and then we don't even remember the Northern Ireland Protocol. I mean, the the whole thing is just stretched out so that No. There's something else. But he he there's a there's a there's a clip of him, when he was Not the Tory leader, but I think he was mayor. And he was at some event where he actually said that my strategy is to put so much stuff out there, Makes so many gaffes that nobody knows which gaff to focus on. And, of course, he was doing it as part of his after dinner funny guy shtick, but there's something in that. But I do think people have started to see through it. And if if we take your marriage analogy a bit further, let's go to another marriage, and that's between the relationship between the people of Australia and Scott Morrison. Because if there's one thing that happened this week that should worry Johnson, it is that. Because, basically, in that marriage, the Australian people have said, listen, mate. We're not having you anymore, and we're gonna look around. And what's incredible about what what happened in Australia, Rory, is that Labour won, and we now have a Labour prime minister, but their share of the vote went down. And the reason for that was I'm glad that I educated you last week about TEALS because they became absolutely key in the outcome of this election. And we honestly, of all the questions you mentioned the 600 and so questions. We had dozens about Australia. Let me just run through a few, and then we can Maybe pick up pick up the debate. There's quite a few about whether we should have compulsory voting. There was a few about whether we should change the electoral system to have it more like Australia. There were quite a few. Ian Winter, does the political pendulum always swing back? My answer to that is no. What David Williams, what can Labour learn from this? Rachel Kelly, Morrison Murdoch Crosby, did they fail to remember that women exist? Which I thought was a very, very good, very good question. And, Andrew Ketching, how does the UK Australia relationship evolve? And, of course, quite a few as well about about China. So thanks to all those who sent in questions about Australia. But where do you wanna pick up on the on the list? Let's let's start with the teals. So you you raised them last week, and I I think what you pointed out last week is that they're called teals because they are basically blue or conservative on fiscal policy, But they're green on environmental policy. Yeah. And they're real independents. I mean, the the teal is just sort of Summing up a whole series of independent campaigns, almost all of them, the successful campaign's women. I was struck by the fact a surprising number of them were doctors. Yeah. And many of them have been backed by a particular philanthropist who essentially has 3 requirements. He wants candidates who care about the environment. Mhmm. He wants candidates with political integrity. Mhmm. And he wants candidates who care about gender equality. Yep. And they set up quite small teams, quite small campaigning teams. All things, by the way, Roy, that Morrison and the populists would deride and dismiss as woke. So that's And they did it. That's the other good thing out of this. One of the things that I'm mesmerized by is that, of course, they ran as independents. And I was it made me think again about running to be mayor of London as an independent. Yeah. And I think it's easy to say, firstly, that it's difficult for independents to come through against big parties because big parties have a lot of money. They have the organization already on the ground. But the other thing that I think I remembered is just how difficult it is setting up a party from scratch and how expensive it is. We we had 2 running in London set up field teams in 32 different boroughs, which meant recruiting 32 field organizers in 32 boroughs. We needed to set up full Facebook campaigns. We needed to work out what our advertising strategy was. Each one of those 32 boroughs then needed field teams going down to the level. We needed to develop apps in order to register what people's priorities were, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Now the reason I'm saying that is that In order to get these independent campaigns going is a lot of time and a lot of patience, and some of these teal campaigners have been at it for a surprisingly long time. Mhmm. And I think that's how we would do it in Britain. I think the lesson I'd probably take from London is that it's probably not something that you do in 1 election. It's something where if you're really gonna win, you have to build it up over 2 or 3. So does that mean you're gonna go again? Well, I think I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know. The The other thing, though, Rory, is they're not you called them at the start of the 2 party. They're not a party. They're they're genuine independents. Do you just happen to be operating with some principles and structures that they can share. Exactly. They're not a party at all. They're they're all independents, and that was something I also picked up in London. I when I started talking to parties, we looked at a a possible alliance with the Lib Dems and discovered, at least in in our polling, that I would have dropped from almost 20% in the polls down to about 5% in the polls if I'd branded myself to Lib Dem at that stage Wow. That people preferred Preferred independent to Lib Dems. Now that may not still be true. This is probably why you keep pushing back on these questions that we get every single week about why you want And just don't just join the Lib Dems and get over with it. I tell you, the other big lesson in this is is actually in the character of Anthony Albanese, the the the the new prime minister, I mean, it is basically just keep going. That guy has been around on forever. And and he was always seen as a kind of John Prescott type figure, not least because he was pretty big and pretty punchy. He lost a lot of weight. He He kind of toned down some of the rougher edges. He had an amazing backstory. You know, his mom was who went to a tour of Europe, met a guy in Italy, got pregnant, went back to Australia. Albanese didn't actually meet his dad until, I think, he was in his thirties. So a very kind of working class tough working class background, but just kept going. I can I was actually in Australia? Have you ever seen The Killing Season, by the way? No. The Killing Season. You've got to see the killing season. It's a series of documentaries by Australian television about the history of the Rudd Gillard relationship and the constant spills and the labor leadership fights. It is one of the most gripping, compelling Political documentary series you ever see. But Albanese is in there and about there. And I was actually in Australia. I saw Julia Gillard on the day that Rudd finally made his move and absolutely knifed her and and was gone. Now but Albanese seems to have Used all that experience to project himself in a way that I don't know. It's very hard to explain because it's not really how he's always come across in the past. And so I now, of course, what what he does is going to dictate whether he's a a successor or not, but he's he's starting with an incredible amount of goodwill. And the other lesson, I think, for Labour in this that I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, I watched the Australian leaders debate, which was horrific. It was just 2 men in suits shouting at each other with a poor woman in the middle trying to keep some sort of order. In his acceptance speech, Albanese just did a completely different tone. He didn't mention Morrison. He wasn't at all negative. It was all about positive future. And I think Labour need to get a lot more of that going at the moment. We can be so much better than this. So Albanese's Interesting model, isn't he? Because he suggests that there are 2 very different models in western politics. One of them is The sort of fresh faced, young person becoming the leader, the sort of Blair, Cameron, Obama. Macron. The other is Rory Stewart. Exactly. Exactly. The the other is, the, Joe Biden model, isn't it? I mean, Albanese is almost the Joe Biden model, which is that Biden was written off again and again and again, you know, was running to be president for almost 30 years, and finally makes it through. And I think there's a there there's a question also when we look at British politics. I mean, there was this amazing speech From Murray Black that you you watched and I watched too. Mhmm. And because she came to the House of Commons at an incredibly young age, and I can't remember what she twenties. Early twenties. 21, 22 or something. And and at a time when the S&P barely thought they could take those seats, and they had candidates Like Mary, who hadn't really been in the system for a long time. Rory, I know I happen to know that Douglas Alexander is a regular listener to our podcast. This will be a very, very, very painful change for us to have. Just bear that in mind. It it's a pretty painful exchange. And it's painful for me too because, actually, she was a very, A noncollegial colleague. I mean, she was one of the only people in the house of commons I could never get to meet my eye or smile at me or recognize. Whereas Labour conservative, and actually people like Alex Salmon would always stop for a chat and be cheerful. You very much got the sense with her that She wouldn't look at me because she basically thought we were all completely evil, and she wasn't gonna acknowledge us for the stare. So I I come with a bit of prejudice, but I must say that was the most extraordinary speech. It's called for anyone who hasn't watched it, watch it on Twitter. It's called the f word speech, and the f word Turns out, obviously, to be? Fascism. And the reason for that was because she was basically saying and and I've been arguing this for some time as well, that Fascism doesn't sort of come with, holocausts and concentration camps and all the rest. It's about the undermining of Institutions that hold people to account. It's about the debasing of truth. It's about the control of media. It's about the use of symbols. It's about policy being less important than messaging. And, you know, we're seeing a lot of it. And, you know, you and I talked about this before. I I've I've been reading far too many books about the 19 thirties for my good, and there's just too many parallels going on. And I but I thought that, you know and back to this point we've talked about so many times that Parliamentary speeches just are not covered. You only know about that speech if you if you're on social media and you're sharing it, if somebody shared it with you. I sent it to you, other people have sent it to me, and it's had several 1000000 views, which is a lot for a speech, but it hasn't really entered the kind of Mainstream political debate. That's amazing. And, of course, the chamber's completely empty when you I mean, if you look around, there's nobody there listening to it. And and that's one of the sad things. I mean, obviously, parliament, literally, in French, means a talking shop, and the whole core of our democracy was meant to be those Debates in the chamber, but now everybody's looking at their phones. Nobody really attends. And so the days when You were able to stand up with a speech like that and really move public opinion or bring down prime ministers. So there's great 19th century moments where Stand up and finish Peel's career with a great speech. Well, I suppose we saw a little bit of that with Robin Cooks. We saw it with Geoffrey Howe. Jeffrey Howe. Yep. Jeffrey Howe. Henry Henry Ben's speech on Syria. Yeah. But there's there's not much of it. And a lot of the time, some of the really great speeches, This was one of the frustrating things about being an MP. You'd have your great speech that you thought was gonna be the great moment, and you'd Spend days preparing it, and you'd turn up in the chamber, and there's nobody there. Well, back in the day back in the day before podcast, Roy, and before I was, I I I left journalism. I had a I had a a midnight radio show on radio 5 live in the early days. And the 2 politicians who I could always persuade to come on were Tessa Jowell, because she was a great friend, and Bill Cash. And I remember Bill Cash saying, if ever you've got something you want to keep secret, the best thing to do is to wrap it up in a house of common speech. So I've been thinking a lot about Bilkash. This is for gonna be even more irritating and traumatizing to you, but, I was thinking about those guys who were basically my main adversaries in the House of Commons. So the hard Brexiteers, the ERG group Yeah. Which stretch from Bill Cash right through to Marc Francois Steve Baker. And I remember turning up in the House of Commons in 2010, and I realize now that they were completely underestimated, But David Cameron and his whole new government thought we don't need to think about these guys at all. Now that may be a bit like the way that Labour would have thought about Jeremy Corbyn and his group in 2010. And that these people were fanatics that Bill Cash gave these speeches that that nobody listened to. Cameron called them. What is it? Fruitcakes and loonies is what Cameron That's right. Yep. Fruitcakes and minis. And because they weren't ever gonna become ministers, because they gave these long speeches that nobody listened to, because they were talking about Europe, Which Cameron felt was sort of number 10 on anybody's priorities. The whole culture of the House of Commons sort of turned against them. People didn't really sit with them in the tea room. Mhmm. They didn't seem to be going anywhere. Someone like Bill Cash, who'd been in the House of Commons for decades, will have felt that young people like me coming in, A range around camera were kind of sneering at them and underestimating all the dedication they put in, and they got a real fuel from it. I've been reading this book by Marc Francois called Spartan Victory. And it was a very uncomfortable book for me because, obviously, Marc Francois sees me as a sort of antichrist. But what I take from it is how at a period where everything had become non ideological, where Cameron didn't really seem to take ideas too seriously where everything was sort of about promotion and about communication. This group of people who fought Betuel, for worse, had created a sort of crusade around the European Union. For some of them, it was because they had strangely connected it, In the case of Marc Francois to the 2nd World War, in the case of Steve Baker, his religious beliefs seem to come into it. But whatever the motivations were, We massively underestimated them, and I think there was a real lesson that we sort of misunderstood what parliament was, and you Underestimate these people at your peril. Well, we had, Fiona and I ran out for dinner last night with a wonderful woman called Milan Vavir, who Worked for the Clintons, and, she's still very kind of active in democratic party circles. And and she was outlining these people on the radical religious right who similarly were basically just seen as kind of Wacko weirdo extremists. But she says they've been organizing and organizing and organizing for years years years years years years. And now, You know, they've got what they're they're getting what they want on abortion. The Republican Party has become a completely different party to what it was, and the radical right is in charge. And they could come back and and win again. But let's not let's not go into the break on any pressing. Just try to get something something positive. I do I do think, Roy, that one of the best things that's come out of the, Australia election is this Mythology around Linton Crosby, is, I think, gone. But to be honest, I've never quite understood it because he we we were up against him in 2000 and when he ran Michael Howard's campaign, which is one of the worst campaigns I've ever seen in my life. But the other mythology is this idea that Murdoch always backs winners. Murdoch threw absolutely everything at Albanese, worse than anything that, you know, we've had here. And I think I should probably, just for the sake of Full openness and transparency, acknowledge there were quite a few questions aimed at me. Of the world. Should he go? Mister Pinfield, you're very critical of Murdoch these days, Alastair, but do you now regret cozying up to him? And the answer is that I think I can justify our approach because the media has I'd worked out as a journalist that if you do not neutralize and tame the media As the Labour Party, you had a massive problem. So I can justify the fact that we went out and tried to kind of tame Murdoch. But at the same time, I don't think that's inconsistent with saying that he has been a very maligned force in British and world politics. And, therefore, I think one of the best things about Australia is that despite him throwing tons of barrels of ink at Albanese, Albanese won. Firstly, I suppose first question is, did it did it help you in 97 having having the endorsement of Murdoch? I don't think the endorsement mattered that much. I think what mattered And did help was the fact that they didn't even try to do to us what they'd done to Neil Kinnock, what they did to Michael Foote, what the mailer currently, etcetera, are currently trying to do to Keir Starmer, and that helped. I I I actually think that Murdoch backed us in 97 because he knew we were gonna win, and he wanted to maintain the myth that, you know, he always backs the winner and and and thereby just give the sense that he creates the winner. And, Alastair, was there something more in retrospect that you could have done with your enormous majority after 97 to change the way the British press worked. I don't think we could have done it in the 1st term because we hadn't even engaged in that as a debating issue in the run up to the election. But if you I know you're an avid reader of my diaries, Rory. If you know, One of the things that Tony and I argued about in the 2nd term in particular after the media really turned was that I was identifying them as a massive cultural problem, which I think they are. I really think they've done incredible damage to our standing in the world, to Level of our democracy and our debate, etcetera. And Tony's view, which I completely understand because he's the guy in the end who was, you know, the the the prime target of all this. His view in the end was he had so many fights to fight that sort of taking on in the way that I was sometimes suggesting The the media would have would have just been a kind of, you know, a big mistake. I also think that, Cameron, In being pushed into calling the Levison inquiry and then not implementing the findings was another massive mistake, which I think we're paying a price for. Should he have implemented the findings? Definitely. Definitely. And, also, here we are again talking yet again about the relationship between police and politicians and police and media. And that whole part of this Leveson part 2 wasn't even carried out. So, yeah, I I think we have a a you know? And as you know, I've just been in Germany. And, honestly, reading the German press, it's just it's it's so Refreshing to sort of read stuff that's just full of information, and then you get to the comment pages and it's full of comment. Well, let let's take that optimism into the break As for return for that, you've been listening to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. So welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Now, Alastair, one of the things that you've been interested in is island nations and the way in which countries like Solomon Islands are Developing their relations with China. Wanna tell us a bit about that? Well, this relates to what we were talking about just before the break. I didn't even know about this until I picked up De Welt and the Frankfurt Algemeiner Zeitung in Germany last week. And there were these massive articles, I mean, like, literally pages on the Solomon Islands. And now he said, well, what who cares about the Solomon Islands? Well, it's Here's a question for you, Rory. Do you know what Iron Bottom Sound is? No. What is Iron Bottom Sound? Iron Bottom Sound is a stretch of water, off the Solomon Islands. And the reason it's called Ironbottom Sound is there are 50 warships at the bottom of it, both American and Japanese from World War 2 battles. And it's always been quite an important kind of strategic place. And out of the world 2nd World War, it became very much part of the American Australian Sphere of influence, and that's never been questioned. They've now signed this rather significant security deal with China. And, of course, China, who are always who are also persuaded them to end diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, for example. They've been building airfields in they built a new port in Vanuatu. There's a new airfield now planned in, in Kiribati. And they're just we've talked about this before, but it's just the expansion of their orbit. And, you know, Albanese, One of his first I think his first big event really as as Australian prime minister is going to be the so called quad, him, Biden, India, and Japan talking about Asian security. And, of course, then you have Biden the other day, giving yet another heart attack to the state department when he They have an official policy of strategic ambiguity on Taiwan. And Joe Biden came straight out and said that if they're going to Taiwan, we're going after them, which is Big news, people. Well, this this this thing about China winning over the support of small nations is Fascinating. I mean, that iron bottom sound sounds like a really big strategic deal, but it's also true in terms of the way in which all these international bodies work, Which is why Taiwan has been fighting this rearguard action for years. Taiwan has or tried to keep embassies and representations in these Tiny South Sea Islands, which hardly made sense for a small country because it desperately needed their votes in the UN and elsewhere, and China has been chipping away at them 1 by 1 if You look at the graph of those countries. And there's only 13 left. Yeah. As the decades go on, the number of people supporting Taiwan decreases again and again and again. They still got the Holy See. Still So what the Holy Spirit? They've got the Vatican. They've got the Vatican. But that also means that when you're doing things like I I was very involved in trying to get Get involved in the election of the director general of World Health Organization, which is quite important. That's Ebola. That's COVID. All this kind of stuff. Yeah. And there, it was very striking how Britain and the United States had lost control of small nations' votes, how we couldn't really get our candidates through. We had a fantastic candidate, David Nabarro, very, very British development medical expert who'd been very involved in Ebola running against, a Ethiopian minister with a slightly patchy track record. But my goodness, I noticed that Europe, United States, Britain were not able to get their candidate through And how easy it was either for African countries aligned or, in fact, for China Mhmm. Pushing on small levers To make sure that they're dominating these international organizations again and again. And part of the secret is getting small countries on-site. Absolutely. There's a very, I I don't know if you're aware of this, but, you know, Boris Johnson is currently working against Patricia Scotland trying to end her tenure as the at the head of the Commonwealth, which is pretty extraordinary for for a British prime minister to be trying to do in a Brit. And who's he trying to bring in? Somebody in Jamaica that apparently is not even very popular in Jamaica. It's all very, very, very, very odd. So yeah. So that's that's the the the Solomon Islands and and but but I think that It goes back to your point last week about you know, we were talking about, The New York Times. I did not even know about this Simon Island, deal with the Chinese until I picked up these German newspapers. And and it's partly structure, isn't it? I mean, we keep talking about these newspapers, but I think we got quite a good Question coming in last week from somebody who was involved in newspapers pointing out how much their circulation was falling, how much their revenue is falling. Yeah. And and I've noticed this myself. When I, you know, started working abroad in the mid nineties, every country I worked in was full of foreign correspondence. And and now they're just so few. There are They don't have the money. They don't have the money. They don't have the money. And that's why you need these Kind of big broadsheets and the broadcasters to have the kind of level of funding that they've got to be able to send people to do stuff on the ground. I did a little bit of mayor corporate on the Murdoch thing. And I had a very challenging question this week, Rory, from Nick Siegler, who reminded me. I didn't need reminding him because I remember him very, very well. But he was the Labour Party the guy in the Labour Party used to deal with all our sister parties and deal with foreign media. And he was always badgering me in 1994 to 1997 to sit Tony down with lots of foreign journalists. And I would say, listen, Nick. It's low votes TV of what I'm doing it. And he says that you and Rory talk all the time about foreign affairs and, you know, you're working here and you're working there. So he asked me, do you regret Having that attitude to Foro Media. And, again, yes is the answer. I think it was I think I was tactically correct, but strategically possibly wrong. Yes. That's good. Okay. I think there's quite a lot of that, actually. I mean, I think one of the things that's now coming out with people thinking about new labor is that I noticed with a lot of the questions, so people asking, why didn't you regulate Murdoch? Why didn't you introduce proportional representation? Is that people now that the conservatives have been in for so long see that period from 97 as the sort of last great hope For reorganizing some of the structural big structural features of British politics Yeah. And feel a sense of disappointment that that that didn't happen. I mean, PR we get questions about PR every week, and it's probably worth a discussion all of its own. But where where are you currently on changing our electoral system? I'm I presume you're massively in favor, but can't see it being done while we keep electing Tory governments in the under the old system. Yeah. Well and, of course, you know, we keep talking about how we Change our views. I was very much in favor of 1st Past the Post. I loved the connection to my constituency. I thought these list systems were very, very odd because it meant you didn't have a direct connection to the constituency. But, of course, as I've become more and more worried about The way that these main parties operate, I'm more convinced, basically, that you need freshness in the system. You need a route to get new ideas and new people coming through. Yeah. I've become more and more, yeah, excited by the idea of different systems, and that's why I like the London system. Do you think Labour Should and would it be to their benefit to come out and say that if we get elected, whether as in majority government or in coalition, that we would legislate to change the voting system and bring in a fairer voting system. Yes. But only if you worked about how you communicate that. You don't communicate it by talking about the mechanism. You communicate it by talking about the benefit it'll bring, and that'll all be about integrity, Freshness in politics, new ideas, breaking up the big old parties, I think, is the way you'd describe it. You wouldn't get down to the details of the mechanism. Interesting. Would you just last point on on Australia. I keep going back to Australia because it's the it's the one thing in the last few months that's given me any sort of hope. Mindy, there was Bulgaria and there was Slovenia and there was there was France and there was Germany where, you know, decent people were being elected. But Australia really has been good. But One of Albanese's big policies was, to break to take the oversight of politics away from parliament and have a national anti corruption commission. My god. We need that in Britain. Yeah. Be great. On the other hand, to produce, as usual, my old role of producing some kind of defense of this government, One of the things that is striking in comparison to Australia is, my goodness, Britain has done far, far better on climate change and carbon emissions in Australia. I mean, it's absolutely shocking. I mean, even Albanese's, targets that he set for 2030 are so far behind what Europe and the UK and even United States are doing. Yeah. But I I I I think I think he will move Fast on climate change, I think he got slightly spooked by the sense that more part of Morrison's appeal was his climate denial. But in fact, I think it really be damaged him. And those the fact that those tills campaign particularly on climate and integrity, That should worry Johnson, I think. But it is the one thing, I think, that Boris Johnson has been less bad on than other things. He hasn't gone. He hasn't followed the populist route of Trump and Morrison on climate and the environment, and I think we should give him credit for that. Okay. If you're in safe, if you insist, if you insist. I'm I'm not giving you I I just want I want him gone. He's the worst prime minister this country's ever had. He's Absolutely awful. He's damaging the country phenomenally. And so you feel free to give him credit and feel free to say that Nick Clegg is your hero. Nick Clegg was thrilled, by the way, last week. He was thrilled that you're a that you read his book and that he's your hero, and he sent me a message saying, Campbell, you're next. And I'm sorry, but no. I've got other heroes who are not in politics. A question from David, one for Alastair. I've recently read Michael Crick's Excellent book on Nigel Farage. Do you agree with the premise of the book, Alastair, that Nigel Farage is one of the most important figures in politics in the past 20 years? Yes. I do. I do. And I think what's extraordinary about it, and this goes back to the point you've been making about how where political Influence comes from, Nigel Farage has had an impact on the political landscape without ever being an MP. He was an MEP, but, so, yeah, I think I think don't think anybody can dispute them. Nigel Farage has been a significant political figure. And and part of it is this story about, For better or worse, about people who have a very strong position and just stick at it and keep going. I mean, what's interesting about his career and a lot of these Chris, is that at any moment, there are extraordinary humiliations, extraordinary defeats, extraordinary embarrassments, but they just keep pushing. And it's remarkable how they turn minority positions into majority positions, and that's what should give hope for independents progressives. Well, that's also why I I will not, give up calling out Brexit as being a complete disaster, there, which at some stage, a sensible grown up country will revisit. And I the the other thing about Farage, though, he gets you know, Farage Was a bit like the the loonies and fruitcakes that you were talking about in the ERG earlier. That was in quotes, by the way, David Cameron's phrase, not mine. But he also is somebody who has benefited from never being properly scrutinized as a politician. I I mean, the fact that he has had more appearances on BBC question time because he was kind of clickbait and box office in their terms, the fact that he's now going on to this the whole Carbon zero campaign without ever being held to account on all the lies he told about Brexit. He just moves on to the next thing. And that is that is a big advantage. Whereas if you're in power, You tend to get scrutinized on what you've said and done in the past. By the way, Rui, my favorite question this week was from somebody called Shybawd Buddha. This this question has to make you laugh. Okay? Okay. Can we have a medley of Rory Stewart laughing because he's got the best laugh in politics? Oh, that's very sweet, but I can't laugh to order. I've only got the best laughing pulpits because I can't laugh to order, but that's very sweet of having that spread. You can't laugh to order. I'll this question is definitely going to make you app. And I can't find I can't find the name of the guy who who said to me. He says, this question must be directed only at Rory. Were Burnley right to get rid of Sean Dyche? That's very good. Okay. That's good. I like it. That's very good. Oh, well, I'd and I I can't believe that you've cheered up enough over the last 45 minutes to be able to read a question about Burnley. Now on that, Unfortunately, though, we've run out of time, but I've got very good news. From next week, we will be adding a 2nd podcast in which we will only answer your questions. We're gonna call it The Rest is Politics, Question Time. That is a wonderfully original title. And I think it's because we both feel a little bit guilty that we We we talk so much, and we get so into stuff that we don't we don't get through nearly enough of your questions. I'm gonna save some of the questions from this week, though, for the for the live events that we're doing on Wednesday, because I think some of them are are are really quite good not not to be lost. And and people who haven't been following this closely, Alistair is so competitive that when he discovered that we'd sold out 1 theater On Wednesday night, I'm staggering exhausted off a plan from Jordan to come and join. He's then insisted we do a 2nd show immediately afterwards, which will be at about midnight my time. Both of us have been having moderately difficult technological issues today, so we've we've got through as best we can. And it's been a pleasure, as always, talking to you, Alright. I shall see you on Wednesday evening, and we'll be back with another pod next week. Thank you all very much, and thank you, Alastair. See you on Wednesday.",

To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show tickets. Just go to the rest is politics.com. That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to the rest of this politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Today, we're gonna be discussing the Australian election results, their wider international impact, and I'm gonna try to see if there's any connection between the teal party in Australia and what we've been trying to do with independence in London. We're gonna talk about Joe Biden's worries about island nations looking to China. And huge thank you to everyone who sent in a question this week. Another 600 questions on Twitter and email. So we'll work our way through as many of those as we can in the second half.\n\nRight then, Alisa, I I don't really wanna raise it, but but Burnley.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. You don't wanna raise it, Rory. And and and also, You so don't care, and you so don't know. And it's only a matter of pain to me, so let's just move on. And let's let's start Where we ended last week, which was you saying that lying has to become, more central to our political debate.\n\nAnd lo and behold, here we are recording this on the moment on the morning when Boris Johnson, pictures have emerged of him clearly having party. It's an event for which he was not fined by the Metropolitan Police. And there was a brilliant question from Jason Moore, which was, Why is it a crime to lie in the places where laws are enforced, our courts, but not a crime to lie in the place where our laws are made. I think we now just accept. Do we all accept that Johnson has lied in parliament?\n\nSpeaker 1: 100%. He said clearly again and again that he didn't go to a party, said clearly that no rules were broken. And, clearly, the Metropolitan Police has confirmed the rules are broken, and, clearly, there is evidence that he went to parties.\n\nSpeaker 0: So he's got to resign. He's got to resign.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And the problem is that the that this goes to the core of why this matters and why does it matter. It matters Just as it does in the law court because there's no way that the public can come to a decision when they vote unless they have the correct information. And And if people are lying to them in parliament, it's really impossible to have a democracy functioning.\n\nSpeaker 0: So we're ending up with the absolute erosion of what holds our democracy together. And it's all down to your colleagues. It's your former colleagues on the Tory backbenches who, it seems to me, are still not facing up to that reality that you just outlined, and that is horrific.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's extraordinary, isn't it? And it it's odd also how Even people like Charles Walker, who initially said he was gonna go, has now changed his mind and decided that he's come through. Charles Walker did this interview. I think it was with Newsnight where he said he's like some amazing, improbable, heroic cricketer who suddenly comes in at the last moment and takes Five wickets or scores an extraordinary number of runs as though somehow Boris Johnson has presented himself to the public as though not only the rules don't apply to him, not only that he can lie when other people can't, but that Somehow it's all forgiven as though he's some sort of magic exception to the way that everybody else has to behave.\n\nSpeaker 0: But that's I think he's running out of road on that because, I mean, admittedly, going around the place, I'm assuming that the sort of people who come up and talk to me probably either want to abuse me about Iraq Or they agree with me about everything that I say, and that tends to be the the flow. But, you know, you mentioned Burnley up at, Burnley at the weekend, which the Tories sort of view as a homogeneous red wall, etcetera, etcetera. Every single person who with whom I had a discussion about politics, and Johnson was just disgusted by him. And I think that's going deeper and deeper and deeper. And I think the Charles Walkers of this world We're probably thinking, oh, well, if he goes, at least we've got Sunak land lined up.\n\nAnd, of course, Sunak has been utterly torpedoed. So now they're thinking, do we really want let's trust his prime minister, which would be a complete disaster. I think we all know that. So it is literally better the devil, you know, and he happens to be pretty close to being the devil.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's well, there's a brilliant article by Hugo Rifkin in The Times, which completely summed up my sense of dealing with him. Hugo Rifkin says, we're all kind of married to him now.\n\nSpeaker 0: And he sits No. I'm not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me push the metaphor through. So he sits at the breakfast table. He's sort of smirking at you about his latest infidelity. And either you ignore it, in which case he's won, Or you screech at him about it, in which case he's also 1 because then all his mates are like, yeah. I know.\n\nBut, of course, he behaves like that because you're always screeching at him. And one of the tricks is he trivializes everything. Yeah. And and and he does it Rifkin said he does it partly sort of bending time. I'd be interested whether you thought this Made sense as a communications expert because Rifkin points out that what he does is he kinda stretches stories out, And, usually, that would be damaging.\n\nBut in his case, you start a debate going, did Sue Gray set the meeting or did Downing Street That meeting, you stretch it out over 3, 4 days. You force Sophie Ridge on Sky to spend 10 minutes trying to ask Nadim Sahabi who set the calendar in the meeting. And after 4 days when the truth finding comes out, the people asking the questions are made to seem a little bit petty as though they're pushing after a trivial issue because They've had to keep repeating who set the calendar in the diary for 4 days until the public's like, why are you asking about the calendar in the diary?\n\nSpeaker 0: And that's\n\nSpeaker 1: and And and then we don't even remember the Northern Ireland Protocol. I mean, the the whole thing is just stretched out so that No.\n\nSpeaker 0: There's something else. But he he there's a there's a there's a clip of him, when he was Not the Tory leader, but I think he was mayor. And he was at some event where he actually said that my strategy is to put so much stuff out there, Makes so many gaffes that nobody knows which gaff to focus on. And, of course, he was doing it as part of his after dinner funny guy shtick, but there's something in that. But I do think people have started to see through it.\n\nAnd if if we take your marriage analogy a bit further, let's go to another marriage, and that's between the relationship between the people of Australia and Scott Morrison. Because if there's one thing that happened this week that should worry Johnson, it is that. Because, basically, in that marriage, the Australian people have said, listen, mate. We're not having you anymore, and we're gonna look around. And what's incredible about what what happened in Australia, Rory, is that Labour won, and we now have a Labour prime minister, but their share of the vote went down.\n\nAnd the reason for that was I'm glad that I educated you last week about TEALS because they became absolutely key in the outcome of this election. And we honestly, of all the questions you mentioned the 600 and so questions. We had dozens about Australia. Let me just run through a few, and then we can Maybe pick up pick up the debate. There's quite a few about whether we should have compulsory voting.\n\nThere was a few about whether we should change the electoral system to have it more like Australia. There were quite a few. Ian Winter, does the political pendulum always swing back? My answer to that is no. What David Williams, what can Labour learn from this?\n\nRachel Kelly, Morrison Murdoch Crosby, did they fail to remember that women exist? Which I thought was a very, very good, very good question. And, Andrew Ketching, how does the UK Australia relationship evolve? And, of course, quite a few as well about about China. So thanks to all those who sent in questions about Australia.\n\nBut where do you wanna pick up on the on the list?\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's let's start with the teals. So you you raised them last week, and I I think what you pointed out last week is that they're called teals because they are basically blue or conservative on fiscal policy, But they're green on environmental policy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And they're real independents. I mean, the the teal is just sort of Summing up a whole series of independent campaigns, almost all of them, the successful campaign's women. I was struck by the fact a surprising number of them were doctors.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And many of them have been backed by a particular philanthropist who essentially has 3 requirements. He wants candidates who care about the environment. Mhmm. He wants candidates with political integrity.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And he wants candidates who care about gender equality. Yep. And they set up quite small teams, quite small campaigning teams.\n\nSpeaker 0: All things, by the way, Roy, that Morrison and the populists would deride and dismiss as woke. So that's And they did it. That's the other good\n\nSpeaker 1: thing out of this. One of the things that I'm mesmerized by is that, of course, they ran as independents. And I was it made me think again about running to be mayor of London as an independent.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I think it's easy to say, firstly, that it's difficult for independents to come through against big parties because big parties have a lot of money. They have the organization already on the ground. But the other thing that I think I remembered is just how difficult it is setting up a party from scratch and how expensive it is. We we had 2 running in London set up field teams in 32 different boroughs, which meant recruiting 32 field organizers in 32 boroughs. We needed to set up full Facebook campaigns.\n\nWe needed to work out what our advertising strategy was. Each one of those 32 boroughs then needed field teams going down to the level. We needed to develop apps in order to register what people's priorities were, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Now the reason I'm saying that is that In order to get these independent campaigns going is a lot of time and a lot of patience, and some of these teal campaigners have been at it for a surprisingly long time. Mhmm.\n\nAnd I think that's how we would do it in Britain. I think the lesson I'd probably take from London is that it's probably not something that you do in 1 election. It's something where if you're really gonna win, you have to build it up over 2 or 3.\n\nSpeaker 0: So does that mean you're gonna go again?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think I don't know. I don't know. I just don't know.\n\nSpeaker 0: The The other thing, though, Rory, is they're not you called them at the start of the 2 party. They're not a party. They're they're genuine independents. Do you just happen to be operating with some principles and structures that they can share.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. They're not a party at all. They're they're all independents, and that was something I also picked up in London. I when I started talking to parties, we looked at a a possible alliance with the Lib Dems and discovered, at least in in our polling, that I would have dropped from almost 20% in the polls down to about 5% in the polls if I'd branded myself to Lib Dem at that stage Wow. That people preferred Preferred independent to Lib Dems.\n\nNow that may not still be true.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is probably why you keep pushing back on these questions that we get every single week about why you want And just don't just join the Lib Dems and get over with it. I tell you, the other big lesson in this is is actually in the character of Anthony Albanese, the the the the new prime minister, I mean, it is basically just keep going. That guy has been around on forever. And and he was always seen as a kind of John Prescott type figure, not least because he was pretty big and pretty punchy. He lost a lot of weight.\n\nHe He kind of toned down some of the rougher edges. He had an amazing backstory. You know, his mom was who went to a tour of Europe, met a guy in Italy, got pregnant, went back to Australia. Albanese didn't actually meet his dad until, I think, he was in his thirties. So a very kind of working class tough working class background, but just kept going.\n\nI can I was actually in Australia? Have you ever seen The Killing Season, by the way? No. The Killing Season. You've got to see the killing season.\n\nIt's a series of documentaries by Australian television about the history of the Rudd Gillard relationship and the constant spills and the labor leadership fights. It is one of the most gripping, compelling Political documentary series you ever see. But Albanese is in there and about there. And I was actually in Australia. I saw Julia Gillard on the day that Rudd finally made his move and absolutely knifed her and and was gone.\n\nNow but Albanese seems to have Used all that experience to project himself in a way that I don't know. It's very hard to explain because it's not really how he's always come across in the past. And so I now, of course, what what he does is going to dictate whether he's a a successor or not, but he's he's starting with an incredible amount of goodwill. And the other lesson, I think, for Labour in this that I mentioned a couple of weeks ago, I watched the Australian leaders debate, which was horrific. It was just 2 men in suits shouting at each other with a poor woman in the middle trying to keep some sort of order.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Albanese just did a completely different tone. He didn't mention Morrison. He wasn't at all negative. It was all about positive future. And I think Labour need to get a lot more of that going at the moment.\n\nWe can be so much better than this.\n\nSpeaker 1: So Albanese's Interesting model, isn't he? Because he suggests that there are 2 very different models in western politics. One of them is The sort of fresh faced, young person becoming the leader, the sort of Blair, Cameron, Obama. Macron. The other is Rory Stewart.\n\nExactly. Exactly. The the other is, the, Joe Biden model, isn't it? I mean, Albanese is almost the Joe Biden model, which is that Biden was written off again and again and again, you know, was running to be president for almost 30 years, and finally makes it through. And I think there's a there there's a question also when we look at British politics.\n\nI mean, there was this amazing speech From Murray Black that you you watched and I watched too.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And because she came to the House of Commons at an incredibly young age, and I can't remember what she twenties. Early twenties. 21, 22 or something. And and at a time when the S&P barely thought they could take those seats, and they had candidates Like Mary, who hadn't really been in the system for a long time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory, I know I happen to know that Douglas Alexander is a regular listener to our podcast. This will be a very, very, very painful change for us to have. Just bear that in mind.\n\nSpeaker 1: It it's a pretty painful exchange. And it's painful for me too because, actually, she was a very, A noncollegial colleague. I mean, she was one of the only people in the house of commons I could never get to meet my eye or smile at me or recognize. Whereas Labour conservative, and actually people like Alex Salmon would always stop for a chat and be cheerful. You very much got the sense with her that She wouldn't look at me because she basically thought we were all completely evil, and she wasn't gonna acknowledge us for the stare.\n\nSo I I come with a bit of prejudice, but I must say that was the most extraordinary speech. It's called for anyone who hasn't watched it, watch it on Twitter. It's called the f word speech, and the f word Turns out, obviously, to be?\n\nSpeaker 0: Fascism. And the reason for that was because she was basically saying and and I've been arguing this for some time as well, that Fascism doesn't sort of come with, holocausts and concentration camps and all the rest. It's about the undermining of Institutions that hold people to account. It's about the debasing of truth. It's about the control of media.\n\nIt's about the use of symbols. It's about policy being less important than messaging. And, you know, we're seeing a lot of it. And, you know, you and I talked about this before. I I've I've been reading far too many books about the 19 thirties for my good, and there's just too many parallels going on.\n\nAnd I but I thought that, you know and back to this point we've talked about so many times that Parliamentary speeches just are not covered. You only know about that speech if you if you're on social media and you're sharing it, if somebody shared it with you. I sent it to you, other people have sent it to me, and it's had several 1000000 views, which is a lot for a speech, but it hasn't really entered the kind of Mainstream political debate.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing. And, of course, the chamber's completely empty when you I mean, if you look around, there's nobody there listening to it. And and that's one of the sad things. I mean, obviously, parliament, literally, in French, means a talking shop, and the whole core of our democracy was meant to be those Debates in the chamber, but now everybody's looking at their phones. Nobody really attends.\n\nAnd so the days when You were able to stand up with a speech like that and really move public opinion or bring down prime ministers. So there's great 19th century moments where Stand up and finish Peel's career with a great speech. Well, I suppose we saw a little bit of that with Robin Cooks.\n\nSpeaker 0: We saw it with Geoffrey Howe.\n\nSpeaker 1: Jeffrey Howe. Yep. Jeffrey Howe. Henry Henry Ben's speech on Syria. Yeah.\n\nBut there's there's not much of it. And a lot of the time, some of the really great speeches, This was one of the frustrating things about being an MP. You'd have your great speech that you thought was gonna be the great moment, and you'd Spend days preparing it, and you'd turn up in the chamber, and there's nobody there.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, back in the day back in the day before podcast, Roy, and before I was, I I I left journalism. I had a I had a a midnight radio show on radio 5 live in the early days. And the 2 politicians who I could always persuade to come on were Tessa Jowell, because she was a great friend, and Bill Cash. And I remember Bill Cash saying, if ever you've got something you want to keep secret, the best thing to do is to wrap it up in a house of common speech.\n\nSpeaker 1: So I've been thinking a lot about Bilkash. This is for gonna be even more irritating and traumatizing to you, but, I was thinking about those guys who were basically my main adversaries in the House of Commons. So the hard Brexiteers, the ERG group Yeah. Which stretch from Bill Cash right through to Marc Francois Steve Baker. And I remember turning up in the House of Commons in 2010, and I realize now that they were completely underestimated, But David Cameron and his whole new government thought we don't need to think about these guys at all.\n\nNow that may be a bit like the way that Labour would have thought about Jeremy Corbyn and his group in 2010. And that these people were fanatics that Bill Cash gave these speeches that that nobody listened to.\n\nSpeaker 0: Cameron called them. What is it? Fruitcakes and loonies is what Cameron\n\nSpeaker 1: That's right. Yep. Fruitcakes and minis. And because they weren't ever gonna become ministers, because they gave these long speeches that nobody listened to, because they were talking about Europe, Which Cameron felt was sort of number 10 on anybody's priorities. The whole culture of the House of Commons sort of turned against them.\n\nPeople didn't really sit with them in the tea room. Mhmm. They didn't seem to be going anywhere. Someone like Bill Cash, who'd been in the House of Commons for decades, will have felt that young people like me coming in, A range around camera were kind of sneering at them and underestimating all the dedication they put in, and they got a real fuel from it. I've been reading this book by Marc Francois called Spartan Victory.\n\nAnd it was a very uncomfortable book for me because, obviously, Marc Francois sees me as a sort of antichrist. But what I take from it is how at a period where everything had become non ideological, where Cameron didn't really seem to take ideas too seriously where everything was sort of about promotion and about communication. This group of people who fought Betuel, for worse, had created a sort of crusade around the European Union. For some of them, it was because they had strangely connected it, In the case of Marc Francois to the 2nd World War, in the case of Steve Baker, his religious beliefs seem to come into it. But whatever the motivations were, We massively underestimated them, and I think there was a real lesson that we sort of misunderstood what parliament was, and you Underestimate these people at your peril.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, we had, Fiona and I ran out for dinner last night with a wonderful woman called Milan Vavir, who Worked for the Clintons, and, she's still very kind of active in democratic party circles. And and she was outlining these people on the radical religious right who similarly were basically just seen as kind of Wacko weirdo extremists. But she says they've been organizing and organizing and organizing for years years years years years years. And now, You know, they've got what they're they're getting what they want on abortion. The Republican Party has become a completely different party to what it was, and the radical right is in charge.\n\nAnd they could come back and and win again. But let's not let's not go into the break on any pressing. Just try to get something something positive. I do I do think, Roy, that one of the best things that's come out of the, Australia election is this Mythology around Linton Crosby, is, I think, gone. But to be honest, I've never quite understood it because he we we were up against him in 2000 and when he ran Michael Howard's campaign, which is one of the worst campaigns I've ever seen in my life.\n\nBut the other mythology is this idea that Murdoch always backs winners. Murdoch threw absolutely everything at Albanese, worse than anything that, you know, we've had here. And I think I should probably, just for the sake of Full openness and transparency, acknowledge there were quite a few questions aimed at me. Of the world. Should he go?\n\nMister Pinfield, you're very critical of Murdoch these days, Alastair, but do you now regret cozying up to him? And the answer is that I think I can justify our approach because the media has I'd worked out as a journalist that if you do not neutralize and tame the media As the Labour Party, you had a massive problem. So I can justify the fact that we went out and tried to kind of tame Murdoch. But at the same time, I don't think that's inconsistent with saying that he has been a very maligned force in British and world politics. And, therefore, I think one of the best things about Australia is that despite him throwing tons of barrels of ink at Albanese, Albanese won.\n\nSpeaker 1: Firstly, I suppose first question is, did it did it help you in 97 having having the endorsement of Murdoch?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think the endorsement mattered that much. I think what mattered And did help was the fact that they didn't even try to do to us what they'd done to Neil Kinnock, what they did to Michael Foote, what the mailer currently, etcetera, are currently trying to do to Keir Starmer, and that helped. I I I actually think that Murdoch backed us in 97 because he knew we were gonna win, and he wanted to maintain the myth that, you know, he always backs the winner and and and thereby just give the sense that he creates the winner.\n\nSpeaker 1: And, Alastair, was there something more in retrospect that you could have done with your enormous majority after 97 to change the way the British press worked.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think we could have done it in the 1st term because we hadn't even engaged in that as a debating issue in the run up to the election. But if you I know you're an avid reader of my diaries, Rory. If you know, One of the things that Tony and I argued about in the 2nd term in particular after the media really turned was that I was identifying them as a massive cultural problem, which I think they are. I really think they've done incredible damage to our standing in the world, to Level of our democracy and our debate, etcetera. And Tony's view, which I completely understand because he's the guy in the end who was, you know, the the the prime target of all this.\n\nHis view in the end was he had so many fights to fight that sort of taking on in the way that I was sometimes suggesting The the media would have would have just been a kind of, you know, a big mistake. I also think that, Cameron, In being pushed into calling the Levison inquiry and then not implementing the findings was another massive mistake, which I think we're paying a price for.\n\nSpeaker 1: Should he have implemented the findings?\n\nSpeaker 0: Definitely. Definitely. And, also, here we are again talking yet again about the relationship between police and politicians and police and media. And that whole part of this Leveson part 2 wasn't even carried out. So, yeah, I I think we have a a you know?\n\nAnd as you know, I've just been in Germany. And, honestly, reading the German press, it's just it's it's so Refreshing to sort of read stuff that's just full of information, and then you get to the comment pages and it's full of comment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let let's take that optimism into the break As for return for that, you've been listening to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: So welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Now, Alastair, one of the things that you've been interested in is island nations and the way in which countries like Solomon Islands are Developing their relations with China. Wanna tell us a bit about that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, this relates to what we were talking about just before the break. I didn't even know about this until I picked up De Welt and the Frankfurt Algemeiner Zeitung in Germany last week. And there were these massive articles, I mean, like, literally pages on the Solomon Islands. And now he said, well, what who cares about the Solomon Islands? Well, it's Here's a question for you, Rory.\n\nDo you know what Iron Bottom Sound is?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. What is Iron Bottom Sound?\n\nSpeaker 0: Iron Bottom Sound is a stretch of water, off the Solomon Islands. And the reason it's called Ironbottom Sound is there are 50 warships at the bottom of it, both American and Japanese from World War 2 battles. And it's always been quite an important kind of strategic place. And out of the world 2nd World War, it became very much part of the American Australian Sphere of influence, and that's never been questioned. They've now signed this rather significant security deal with China.\n\nAnd, of course, China, who are always who are also persuaded them to end diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, for example. They've been building airfields in they built a new port in Vanuatu. There's a new airfield now planned in, in Kiribati. And they're just we've talked about this before, but it's just the expansion of their orbit. And, you know, Albanese, One of his first I think his first big event really as as Australian prime minister is going to be the so called quad, him, Biden, India, and Japan talking about Asian security.\n\nAnd, of course, then you have Biden the other day, giving yet another heart attack to the state department when he They have an official policy of strategic ambiguity on Taiwan. And Joe Biden came straight out and said that if they're going to Taiwan, we're going after them, which is\n\nSpeaker 1: Big news, people. Well, this this this thing about China winning over the support of small nations is Fascinating. I mean, that iron bottom sound sounds like a really big strategic deal, but it's also true in terms of the way in which all these international bodies work, Which is why Taiwan has been fighting this rearguard action for years. Taiwan has or tried to keep embassies and representations in these Tiny South Sea Islands, which hardly made sense for a small country because it desperately needed their votes in the UN and elsewhere, and China has been chipping away at them 1 by 1 if You look at the graph of those countries.\n\nSpeaker 0: And there's only 13 left.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. As the decades go on, the number of people supporting Taiwan decreases again and again and again.\n\nSpeaker 0: They still got the Holy See. Still So\n\nSpeaker 1: what the Holy Spirit?\n\nSpeaker 0: They've got the Vatican. They've got the Vatican.\n\nSpeaker 1: But that also means that when you're doing things like I I was very involved in trying to get Get involved in the election of the director general of World Health Organization, which is quite important. That's Ebola. That's COVID. All this kind of stuff. Yeah.\n\nAnd there, it was very striking how Britain and the United States had lost control of small nations' votes, how we couldn't really get our candidates through. We had a fantastic candidate, David Nabarro, very, very British development medical expert who'd been very involved in Ebola running against, a Ethiopian minister with a slightly patchy track record. But my goodness, I noticed that Europe, United States, Britain were not able to get their candidate through And how easy it was either for African countries aligned or, in fact, for China Mhmm. Pushing on small levers To make sure that they're dominating these international organizations again and again. And part of the secret is getting small countries on-site.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. There's a very, I I don't know if you're aware of this, but, you know, Boris Johnson is currently working against Patricia Scotland trying to end her tenure as the at the head of the Commonwealth, which is pretty extraordinary for for a British prime minister to be trying to do in a Brit.\n\nSpeaker 1: And who's he trying to bring in?\n\nSpeaker 0: Somebody in Jamaica that apparently is not even very popular in Jamaica. It's all very, very, very, very odd. So yeah. So that's that's the the the Solomon Islands and and but but I think that It goes back to your point last week about you know, we were talking about, The New York Times. I did not even know about this Simon Island, deal with the Chinese until I picked up these German newspapers.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and it's partly structure, isn't it? I mean, we keep talking about these newspapers, but I think we got quite a good Question coming in last week from somebody who was involved in newspapers pointing out how much their circulation was falling, how much their revenue is falling.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and I've noticed this myself. When I, you know, started working abroad in the mid nineties, every country I worked in was full of foreign correspondence. And and now they're just so few. There are They don't have the money. They don't\n\nSpeaker 0: have the money. They don't have the money. And that's why you need these Kind of big broadsheets and the broadcasters to have the kind of level of funding that they've got to be able to send people to do stuff on the ground. I did a little bit of mayor corporate on the Murdoch thing. And I had a very challenging question this week, Rory, from Nick Siegler, who reminded me.\n\nI didn't need reminding him because I remember him very, very well. But he was the Labour Party the guy in the Labour Party used to deal with all our sister parties and deal with foreign media. And he was always badgering me in 1994 to 1997 to sit Tony down with lots of foreign journalists. And I would say, listen, Nick. It's low votes TV of what I'm doing it.\n\nAnd he says that you and Rory talk all the time about foreign affairs and, you know, you're working here and you're working there. So he asked me, do you regret Having that attitude to Foro Media. And, again, yes is the answer. I think it was I think I was tactically correct, but strategically possibly wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. That's good. Okay. I think there's quite a lot of that, actually. I mean, I think one of the things that's now coming out with people thinking about new labor is that I noticed with a lot of the questions, so people asking, why didn't you regulate Murdoch?\n\nWhy didn't you introduce proportional representation? Is that people now that the conservatives have been in for so long see that period from 97 as the sort of last great hope For reorganizing some of the structural big structural features of British politics\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: And feel a sense of disappointment that that that didn't happen.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, PR we get questions about PR every week, and it's probably worth a discussion all of its own. But where where are you currently on changing our electoral system? I'm I presume you're massively in favor, but can't see it being done while we keep electing Tory governments in the under the old system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well and, of course, you know, we keep talking about how we Change our views. I was very much in favor of 1st Past the Post. I loved the connection to my constituency. I thought these list systems were very, very odd because it meant you didn't have a direct connection to the constituency.\n\nBut, of course, as I've become more and more worried about The way that these main parties operate, I'm more convinced, basically, that you need freshness in the system. You need a route to get new ideas and new people coming through.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I've become more and more, yeah, excited by the idea of different systems, and that's why I like the London system.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think Labour Should and would it be to their benefit to come out and say that if we get elected, whether as in majority government or in coalition, that we would legislate to change the voting system and bring in a fairer voting system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. But only if you worked about how you communicate that. You don't communicate it by talking about the mechanism. You communicate it by talking about the benefit it'll bring, and that'll all be about integrity, Freshness in politics, new ideas, breaking up the big old parties, I think, is the way you'd describe it. You wouldn't get down to the details of the mechanism.\n\nSpeaker 0: Interesting. Would you just last point on on Australia. I keep going back to Australia because it's the it's the one thing in the last few months that's given me any sort of hope. Mindy, there was Bulgaria and there was Slovenia and there was there was France and there was Germany where, you know, decent people were being elected. But Australia really has been good.\n\nBut One of Albanese's big policies was, to break to take the oversight of politics away from parliament and have a national anti corruption commission. My god. We need that in Britain.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Be great. On the other hand, to produce, as usual, my old role of producing some kind of defense of this government, One of the things that is striking in comparison to Australia is, my goodness, Britain has done far, far better on climate change and carbon emissions in Australia. I mean, it's absolutely shocking. I mean, even Albanese's, targets that he set for 2030 are so far behind what Europe and the UK and even United States are doing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But I I I I think I think he will move Fast on climate change, I think he got slightly spooked by the sense that more part of Morrison's appeal was his climate denial. But in fact, I think it really be damaged him. And those the fact that those tills campaign particularly on climate and integrity, That should worry Johnson, I think.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it is the one thing, I think, that Boris Johnson has been less bad on than other things. He hasn't gone. He hasn't followed the populist route of Trump and Morrison on climate and the environment, and I think we should give him credit for that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. If you're in safe, if you insist, if you insist. I'm I'm not giving you I I just want I want him gone. He's the worst prime minister this country's ever had. He's Absolutely awful.\n\nHe's damaging the country phenomenally. And so you feel free to give him credit and feel free to say that\n\nSpeaker 1: Nick Clegg is your hero.\n\nSpeaker 0: Nick Clegg was thrilled, by the way, last week. He was thrilled that you're a that you read his book and that he's your hero, and he sent me a message saying, Campbell, you're next. And I'm sorry, but no. I've got other heroes who are not in politics.\n\nSpeaker 1: A question from David, one for Alastair. I've recently read Michael Crick's Excellent book on Nigel Farage. Do you agree with the premise of the book, Alastair, that Nigel Farage is one of the most important figures in politics in the past 20 years?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. I do. I do. And I think what's extraordinary about it, and this goes back to the point you've been making about how where political Influence comes from, Nigel Farage has had an impact on the political landscape without ever being an MP. He was an MEP, but, so, yeah, I think I think don't think anybody can dispute them.\n\nNigel Farage has been a significant political figure.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and part of it is this story about, For better or worse, about people who have a very strong position and just stick at it and keep going. I mean, what's interesting about his career and a lot of these Chris, is that at any moment, there are extraordinary humiliations, extraordinary defeats, extraordinary embarrassments, but they just keep pushing. And it's remarkable how they turn minority positions into majority positions, and that's what should give hope for independents progressives.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that's also why I I will not, give up calling out Brexit as being a complete disaster, there, which at some stage, a sensible grown up country will revisit. And I the the other thing about Farage, though, he gets you know, Farage Was a bit like the the loonies and fruitcakes that you were talking about in the ERG earlier. That was in quotes, by the way, David Cameron's phrase, not mine. But he also is somebody who has benefited from never being properly scrutinized as a politician. I I mean, the fact that he has had more appearances on BBC question time because he was kind of clickbait and box office in their terms, the fact that he's now going on to this the whole Carbon zero campaign without ever being held to account on all the lies he told about Brexit.\n\nHe just moves on to the next thing. And that is that is a big advantage. Whereas if you're in power, You tend to get scrutinized on what you've said and done in the past. By the way, Rui, my favorite question this week was from somebody called Shybawd Buddha. This this question has to make you laugh.\n\nOkay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can we have a medley of Rory Stewart laughing because he's got the best laugh in politics?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's very sweet, but I can't laugh to order. I've only got the best laughing pulpits because I can't laugh to order, but that's very sweet of having that spread.\n\nSpeaker 0: You can't laugh to order. I'll this question is definitely going to make you app. And I can't find I can't find the name of the guy who who said to me. He says, this question must be directed only at Rory. Were Burnley right to get rid of Sean Dyche?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's very good. Okay. That's good. I like it. That's very good.\n\nOh, well, I'd and I I can't believe that you've cheered up enough over the last 45 minutes to be able to read a question about Burnley. Now on that, Unfortunately, though, we've run out of time, but I've got very good news. From next week, we will be adding a 2nd podcast in which we will only answer your questions. We're gonna call it The Rest is Politics, Question Time.\n\nSpeaker 0: That is a wonderfully original title. And I think it's because we both feel a little bit guilty that we We we talk so much, and we get so into stuff that we don't we don't get through nearly enough of your questions. I'm gonna save some of the questions from this week, though, for the for the live events that we're doing on Wednesday, because I think some of them are are are really quite good not not to be lost.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and people who haven't been following this closely, Alistair is so competitive that when he discovered that we'd sold out 1 theater On Wednesday night, I'm staggering exhausted off a plan from Jordan to come and join. He's then insisted we do a 2nd show immediately afterwards, which will be at about midnight my time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Both of us have been having moderately difficult technological issues today, so we've we've got through as best we can. And it's been a pleasure, as always, talking to you, Alright. I shall see you on Wednesday evening, and we'll be back with another pod next week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you all very much, and thank you, Alastair. See you on Wednesday.",
