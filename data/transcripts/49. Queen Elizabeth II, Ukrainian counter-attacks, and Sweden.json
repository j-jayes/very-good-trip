So welcome to another episode of The Rest is Politics with me, Alastair Campbell. And with me, Rory Stewart. And we are gonna be talking about elections in Sweden and in Kenya. We're gonna be talking about the extraordinary events that unfolded in the last few days in, Ukraine. But, inevitably, we're gonna start with, the death of the queen. A bit weird for both of us, Rory, because neither of us were in the country, and I'm not suggesting too. That that would have affected very much. But I don't know about you in Uganda, but it felt a bit strange being in Albania as Yeah. The country was convulsed. It's strange. Are you are you a privy councilor at the moment? Were you putting the privy council as part of your No. I was never made a privy council. Thank god. I don't as you know, I don't believe in titles. Well, so so as it probably counts, so theoretically, I could have been there at the acclamation service for the for the new king. So I I felt sorry to miss out on that. Although I think they're doing it on a lottery, so I I probably wouldn't have made it in there anyway. So, Yes. One of the things I think I've I've seen you talking a bit about on Twitter is the question of the coverage of the queen. Although most of the coverage I've been picking up is in the nation and the standard, which Kenyan newspapers and then Uganda newspapers, where I must say the coverage has been extraordinary day after day front page coverage in Uganda and Kenya. I was in, a drought affected area of rural Kalifi yesterday, which is, you know, pretty remote, 3 hours on dusty roads, and Union Jack at half mast outside a building, the Kenyan president has announced national mourning, people are wearing black ties In in Cuba, for goodness sake, and this is a lovely little thing on Twitter coming from my friend Ben Judah saying it's going to create real cognitive dissonance for the kind of classic Pro Cuban Republicans to find that the Cuban government has also announced national mourning and put its flags at half mast or queen. This is extraordinary. I do think the the the international response was even though we knew it would be huge, it was extraordinary. I thought that some of the images, seeing the Sydney Opera House with the picture of the queen in the middle bit of that extraordinary construction. I thought the Brandenburg Gate done up as the as the Union Jack was extraordinary. I thought Macron speech, both in French and English, particularly in light of Liz Truss' friend or foe. The jury is out. I thought he I thought he won The foreign tributes. He said he was. He's so graceful, isn't he? And so graceful but but just Justin Trudeau as well, though, I thought was wonderful. Really moving and But the for the what was what was what was interesting, like, Dan Dan, where we, have a place in France, the the local paper, La Provence, Page after page after page and pictures, and and lots of I I did it I I've actually not done I see you've done a few. I had I'm sure you did And everybody dead who's had any connection ever with this extraordinary woman and this remarkable story, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of bids to talk about it. And I actually decided just not to do any. I felt that was easier. And I actually think it's one of those stories where you really There's so much what I call just the blah factory, whereas actually, the stuff that really matters is the is the event itself. It's in the planning. It's what the people who really matter are saying and doing. So I do think that actually seeing those interviews with the former prime ministers was really interesting. I do think that watching the family and and their reactions so forth. But I do I do think there's you mentioned the coverage. I thought the BBC got it Absolutely Right. I thought Hugh Edwards was brilliant. Hugh Edwards, I interviewed him for Men's Health a few months ago, and he he actually said to me that he He thought the death of the queen would the biggest be the biggest test of the BBC in its history, and he also revealed to me that he he practiced for hours in front of his mirror for the moment. And that sounds a bit disrespectful, but I just it's the old Benjamin Franklin thing, fail to prepare, and you're preparing to fail. And he did it absolutely brilliantly. But then I think once we got through the 1st day, by the time I was back from Albania, we're on to sort of day 3. And then, you know, recent days in particular, where you you literally had to watch foreign media to find out what was going on anywhere else in the world. And And I think I do think that, obviously, she's she was incredibly popular, hugely loved around the country and around the world. But I do think this kind of this absolute mononarrative that everybody has to be saying everything was wonderful, and everybody has to be Just cloyingly sort of supportive and pro. And I I'm not saying, you know, we should have had lots of sort of people covering this or the other. But then it led to this extraordinary thing on Sky News where there was a protest by the family and their supporters of somebody, a guy called Chris Kaba, who'd been killed. And there was a protest against police conduct. And so there's these aerial pictures of this protest. The sky you said are there. There are people marching towards Buckingham Palace to take their respects because they're just and to be fair to them, they apologize that it's it was a mistake. Yeah. But it's what happens when you get into this monotone. Yep. And I think we've just gotta be a bit careful. Well, I think I'm sure I think we should probably should be a bit careful. But thank goodness it doesn't happen very often to have a monarch who, lasted 70 years. I mean, it's Strong. Incredible. It is incredible. Sorry. I agree. I mean, the I'm trying to think of this. I mean, in a way, you're right. I mean, I I I did one Brief interview on the Today program, and I've otherwise stayed off completely because I think that there's not a great deal that you can say. I mean, One of the things that I think was part of her genius was she was extremely, well, extremely discreet and extremely restrained. I remember when I got made a privy counsellor, I knew her- I knew her Majesty a little bit and So I was expecting when I went to get you, when you become a secretary set, you go to get these kind of stamps of office, which you can give to your kids to put in candle wax And go around stamping things with, sort of gold chains of office. So I went to receive them in this very kind of formal thing in Windsor Castle and I was expecting a sort of wink or a smile or some sort of recognition of the fact that that she knew me, but she was so Absolutely professional. Very much played it very straight. No distinction between me and anybody else who was being made a minister at the time. I think I think The Daily I think The Daily Mail will love this story. Rory Stewart heard that Queen didn't rat at him. That is very much not what I'm saying. But I guess spacey wigged at me. But I guess what I'm saying is that that she, As a result, I mean, I think it was exactly the right thing to do, right? She's, she's the queen, she's swearing in sexually estate, there's Absolutely formal. No favouritism. Nothing personal going on. But that does mean that some of the encounters that people, I think, have been relating, They're trying to squeeze an enormous amount out of somebody who I think with her friends, you know, I definitely wasn't one of her friends. I think with one of her friends in private, she could relax more, but I think Most of us who are encountering public, we're encountering a pretty formal person from whom you're not extracting a huge number of anecdotes. I I love the the line by Tina Brown. Oh, here we go again promoting the New York Times. Tina Brown wrote a a piece in the in the New York Times. She had it was my favorite line of the whole week. She said, we're so going to miss not knowing what she thinks. I thought that was absolutely brilliant because you don't know what she thinks. I mean, people, I read all those pieces over the over the the the weekend, and all the political correspondents sort of feel they have to get in on the act. So they're writing big, long pieces about Who were her favorite prime ministers and and so forth? And they don't know. The truth is they do not know. And little myths develop. Like, She didn't like Tony Blair because he's, quote, saved her when Diana died. She didn't like Thatcher because she was another strong woman. I think these mythologies just develop, and then they, She really liked Harold Wilson. She really liked John Major because he came from a humble background. We don't know any of that. Exactly. Which is a great tribute to her, but you're quite right. I think that's a good thing to move on to and conclude on that because we don't have a great deal to say. We don't Well, I just really did. I there's actually 1 bit I do want to talk about it, because I don't think I don't think it has been given enough sort of thought amidst all this. And and that is that and I I wrote a book called Winners 7 years ago. And I I actually ended up writing a chapter about the Queen as a very British enduring British winner. And I spoke to a lot of the people who worked for her down the years and because I got to know them during that week of Diana's death. And I do think it's important to recognize this is a point about leadership. Even though prince Philip viewed strategy as something only people like Stalin and Hitler talked about. I think the Queen was remarkably strategic, and I think that her ability to lead and adapt to a world of change while staying the same. And talking to these guys who were I'm not, you know, bullshitting here. They were genuinely close to her. They were part of the operation that sheet led and so forth. And then when they explained to it, it was this whole thing about how do you they they they talked about the famous novel, The Leopard by, Lamped his team. You know, everything must change, everything needs to change so that everything can stay the same. That was the approach. And I just think that that I think we should recognize the kind of it is a form of genius, and, you know, I I have been a Republican all of my life. My 1st ever row with my mother was about not wanting to watch the Queen's speech when I was about 7, and she made me. And and yet you have to recognize that, I think in large part down to her and what she's done over the 70 years, but particularly since Anna Cerebralas when they decided they had to make change. And then again after Diana's death, I think they made changes. She gave the go ahead for that. But, ultimately, what we're seeing at the moment is the celebration of her and the institution rather than the changes, which is an incredible feat. Yeah. Extraordinary. Incidentally, by the way, on on book recommendations, I I've read a wonderful biography Of of Lanpaduser, the the guy that rode the leopard. So, I I I it's called The Last Leopard, and it's by David Gilmour. And so anyone interest it's an amazing book, amazing film too. You'd seen that great black and white film. I can hear, yet again, Bow down to your extraordinary vastness of knowledge because you did not we did not, in any prior discussion, discuss the fact that I was going to to raise the leopard. So well done on that one. No. No. It's it's my friend Felix is obsessed for the film, amazing black and white film. I tried to tried to watch it with the family, and they got really bored. So may maybe it's not for everyone. Now I know you as the arch royalist keep wanting to move off, but I want to come back to something, And that was Prince Charles and the inkwell. Oh. You mentioned the did you ever see this? No. I didn't see the inkwell. No. So when when at the at the meeting of the Privy Council where he was sworn in. And I have to say, I thought I thought Penny Morton was a brilliant emcee. She really did very, very well. But when prince Charles they all had to sign the the thing that they were reading out. And prince William, I remember my daughter watching and saying she was very excited that prince William was left handed because she's left handed. She's left handed. People are superior. But when Charles was sat down to sign it, he got very, very tetchy because there was an inkwell in the way. Oh, I see. And he waved it away very angrily in a way that we all sort of turned to each other and said, god, the queen would never have done that. It was a very you should look it up. It's a very, very interesting moment. Look at that moment. It must be a very tense tense moment. I was sorry I wasn't there, actually. I mean, I it was my mother Thought the only point to my becoming a privy councilor was so that I'd be able to do that, turn up to stand somewhere behind Tony Blair and the line of people in black seats. It it was funny watching, everybody trying to sort of photobomb this. They'd obviously lined up the 6 prime ministers. Yep. Keir Starmer Keir Starmer was standing next to Tony Blair, and they were chatting away. Gordon Brown got the very, very short straw because he was he was next to Boris Johnson, and then there was a bit of a gap. So he had to sort of talk to him quite a lot. And then Tessa Blackstone, I noticed, got in between Theresa May and John Major. So The picture of the 6 never it it was never totally clean. But it wasn't it wasn't an extraordinary event, and, it was It was yeah. It was I I did find the whole thing very moving. And and yesterday, Fiona and I went down to the to the palace and just sort of milling around. And, because during the the week after Diana's death, I was because I was settling backwards and forwards to the palace when we were planning the funeral. I got the feeling there were more I think there were more people around that week. But, actually, when we were walking away, I realized that the The police and the crowd control, they were they were spreading the crowd. So the flowers actually were being laid for a long, long way from the palace. Well And it was pretty it was a pretty extraordinary thing. So Well, it's it's amazing. I mean, maybe in question time, we can get back to this because people have obviously asked whether this The time to rethink the monarchy and republicanism and things. And I think there's some interesting things to be said about that. But you had something on the Swedish elections. Tell us about Swedish elections. This is going out, I think, Wednesday morning, and it may be clearer. We're recording on on Monday. But it it does look pretty seismic what's happening in Sweden because the the ill named Sweden Democrats, have got looked like they're gonna get about 21% 20% of the vote. And the Sweden Democrats are a party that emerged from the Neo Nazis in the eighties. They've done a bit of a rebranding job. They kicked out some of the real kind of, you know, Jean Marie Le Pen types. But they're very, very right wing. There's been a lot of gang violence going on in Sweden. They've been, you know, focused on that. Scandinavia has such a wonderful reputation in the in the rest of the developed world. We also talk about the Scandies. And so the Social Democrats are are are gonna be the biggest party, But because the Sweden Democrats are coming 2nd and then their kind of, I guess, equivalent of our Tory party is the mod they call themselves the moderates. And I think what's going to happen, if if it does go this way, and it literally is on a knife edge, they're now waiting for overseas votes to come in, And it's so close that that may swing it either way. But it but it will be an extraordinary thing. And even for them to get 1 in 5 of the Swedish vote for this far right party, that its campaign mainly on immigration is a pretty extraordinary thing. It's amazing. And the immigration story is amazing in Sweden, because Sweden has been incredibly good about reaching out to asylum seekers and has taken a country which was very ethnically homogeneous In a very short period of time towards a situation where now I think 30% of the Swedish population don't have Swedish as their mother tongue and that's, You know, almost half the population in some areas of cities. So there's part of that going on. They they had, You told me about this just before we went on the podcast, so this is not me showing some amazing knowledge. I just popped on the Guardian website, but one of the things I noticed There was, that they'd campaigned, the Swedish Democrats, this Nazi originating party with a metro train decorated in their Electoral colors called the Repatriation Express with one way ticket, next stop Kabul, and they were sort of driving this underground train through through stations. And it just shows that that sort of nativist, populist, really quite nasty campaigning can strike a chord. They've grown with every one of the last Half dozen elections or so. They've just grown and grown and grown and grown. They've got this quite charismatic leader, Jimmy Akesson, who started out I think he was about 25, and he's now he's now been there 10 years. So quite young still. But I think it will be you know, if they do have to form the government, That will that's a big moment for for Scandinavia and and indeed for the European Union. And we and, you know, we've talked so much about this. So we're back to this whole thing about The power of the force of populism, whether the established parties and governments did take the the concerns about immigration seriously, whether they're just Being exploited or or have you, the whole thing. I think I do think that it'll be interesting again to see whether social media and the abuse of technology has been part of this as it has been of so many of the other elections where this is taking place. So on on this bigger issue, because you're you're you're framing the big strategic issue, I really believe that we are in the middle of an age of populism and it's an age of populism that really got going sort of 2014 to 16, so that's kind of Modi, Bolsonaro, Trump, Brexit, etcetera. And there was a moment with Joe Biden's election and Trump's defeat Where it felt as though maybe the pension was swinging back in another direction, but I think the underlying drivers of populism, Which go all the way back to the 2008 financial crisis and inequality and problems of globalization and social media Are very, very durable and that sadly what we're seeing, that, you know, we get these moments of what seem to be good news, macroselection, for example, But as you've pointed out, under the surface of Macron selection is something very, very worrying, which is actually the the the stronger trend is the deep development of these Far left, far right parties, and a real worry about one another replaces him. Well, the other thing, of course, is is the This is going to be worsened by the conjunction of the energy crisis and the Ukraine war you're already seeing. And the fact that Liz Truss can even appoint somebody like Jacob Rees Mogg to be the business secretary when business we know, I think, does have Actually, the the center of gravity in business is actually concerned about the future of the environment, but the whole net zero campaign, this is that's the next sort of target for the for the populist right. And you can see how easy that's going to be for them. Your bills are going up. Why should you pay the price to save the planet for future generations? It's almost like, you know, what have future generations ever done for me? And that's the game that they're going to play. And and, of course, the problem is that one of the things that the particularly right wing governments attempted to do is effectively put the burden on the very poorest because what they're doing is they're Trying to put a carbon tax on the consumption of carbon, which has a good economic logic, I mean, it makes sense for an economist, But the truth is that that carbon consumption is a much larger proportion of the budget of somebody who's poor than somebody who's wealthy. So It would it would have been very interesting, Marie, if The if the queen had not died when on the day that she did and it was kind of extraordinary. There's Liz Truss, a new prime minister, on her feet in the House of Commons announcing this extraordinarily large energy crisis package and a very, very, very clear dividing line emerging where She thinks this should be not be paid for by windfall tax. It should be paid by borrowing and load loading onto future generations. The thing that they've said during the leadership election, they would never do. And Keir Starmer very, very clear that it should be. And I thought I don't know if you saw any of the debate. I I did think it was one of Keir Starmer's better moments than that. I thought he really It was pretty clear and pretty strong and very, very the the dividing line was clear. And, of course, that debate has now just vanished for now. Yeah. But it's going to come back, and It'll be very interesting to see how that plays out. We'll come back very soon because you're you're quite right. There's been an enormous amount of coverage of the new king, but I I think that's something that will pass very quickly and then we'll be back to the brutal reality of what's happening in our economy. On the Clytemnstein, I'm speaking to you from from Kenya, from Nairobi, where the new president, Ruto? Yep. William Ruto is going to be, sworn in, inaugurated tomorrow. I was actually at the last inauguration of, here of Uhuru Kenyatta, his predecessor. This is another classic popular story. So in this case in Kenya, the old establishment really tried to come together, and it felt as though they could really guarantee stitching up the election. So Adinga represents the Luo community and Kenyatta, the previous president, got behind him. And he represents the Kikuyu community and it felt like There was no way they could be defeated. The maths were all in their favour. And it was a classic campaign run by an older man and Ruto, who was very much the insurgent, younger, being part of political youth movements, actually a history of violence, Was indicted by the International Criminal Court but very much self made. I mean, Adinga's father, Kenyatta's father were Huge politicians in their own right. William Ritu ran a campaign called Hustler Nation and he's the hustler, came from nothing, built a fortune. He's very Trumpian. Very Trumpian. Very, very Trumpian and very much a strong man and very much, you know, challenging a lot of the orthodoxies. And, But a bit like Trump also got some right wing economists on side by talking quite a extreme line on on, on economics. And it it was one of these classic, results where Mombasa, which was supposed to be the real heartland that that was meant to be delivering. Fruitinga didn't really turn out, didn't really vote for him in the way they were supposed to, and the Luo turnouts were low, And the cuckoo vote was split and he got his base out. I mean, this is one of the things the populists do so well. He got that base out and voting when people thought he couldn't, And he's taken the election. And it's a real sign both of troubling populism, but also a very positive sign because it's broken It's broken the stranglehold. It's Britain's trying to hold of the old establishment. It's broken the idea that it's all defined by ethnicity. It it isn't anymore in Kenya for the first time. And the election result was upheld, and there wasn't the widespread violence that people were predicting. So in many ways, it's a really the institutions worked. It's a very impressive live Kenya democracy. We had a few critics this week, Roy. I don't even know if you noticed in the questions that people saying that that I I thought this is very unfair, but they Thought that we were a bit belittling of what was happening in Chile last week. I don't think we were belittling at all. I think we were we were shocked that the result was so big given that so many people had wanted a new constitution. Think we were belittling? What did they do? I don't know. I think because I think because we laughed at the point during the and maybe that's just our Oh. Our humor coming out too too much. We shouldn't laugh too much. I shouldn't laugh too much. There's one more thing on Kenya quickly before we go to Ukraine. I I was, in these very drought affected areas, in Caliphate yesterday. And if you want to see climate change in action, generally people tell stories from things like Lake Chad, which is famously retreating 500 metres a year, so villages eventually are just too far away to even walk for the water, or they talk Stories for Somalia, they don't focus more on the much more complicated, but much more, almost much more worrying story of climate change, which is the way that it's happening In almost every country of the world, and it's a more complicated story. So in the case of Kenya, I was in villages which Givrach had been supporting, but which had been hit Very hard by drought. So you'd go into the maze granaries and there was no maze because the entire crop had been wiped out, just shriveled husks From last year's, you could see the bones on the cows. 1 woman I was talking to had lost, all her livestock. I went out with the young men who were walking their cows out forage. They're now walking miles and miles and miles to try to get a scrap of grass to keep them alive. And it's micro climate stuff. Part of the reason why it's a difficult story to tell is we then drove another 25 miles and found a village where there actually had been some rainfall and everybody was much better off. But I very difficult for journalists to tell these stories because I don't know whether editors can really bring them alive for British voters. But if you want to see climate change and how devastating it's being and why 200,000,000 more people are likely to be pushed into poverty. We've got to learn how to tell these sort of micro stories from places like Kenya. But I think the problem with the whole debate on climate change is that the media large parts of the media in the mail, they don't cover climate change. They cover the weather. It's about the so so we hear about it when we see these flash floods and we see, you know, Pakistan underwater, And and and it's about the rescue, and it's about the operation. But actually, bizarrely, the lot the the the the more impactful these events have been, I think we're actually having less debate about climate change than we did. So and what you're saying there, I mean, even as you were saying that, I was imagining a journalist going in to an editorial meeting and saying, let's go and do something about how climate change is affecting farming in Kenya. Are they gonna look at you and say, well, you know, Shouldn't we be doing shouldn't we be doing something else about prince Charles? Anyway, should we should we should we take a break and come back and and talk about extraordinary events in Ukraine? We will. Thank you. Welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And we we were moving on to the extraordinary developments In Ukraine, do you just wanna remind us what's been happening over the last few days? Well, I mean, I do think if it hadn't been for the for the queen, This would have been, like, huge news. And in fact, even though the Queen has been the main story in pretty much every country in the world, I have been even more than usually getting my news from foreign sources because I think people have realized this is I think, potentially, it's extraordinary. And when you when you have people like Laurie Freedman, the Historian at King's talking about this being a a tipping point, then you have to take that seriously. I mean, Zelensky is is saying and you've got to be careful with this because the the media can't get to the front line. A lot of the information that we're getting is from Telegram videos that have been posted and and from official Ukrainian claims. What they're talking about, as of now as of today, as we're speaking, more than 3,000 square kilometers being taken, including these these very, very important Supply line places, Izium and Kupyans, and and the Russians admitting that they've had to the phrase they use was retreat to regroup. And you're also seeing some extraordinary I noticed John Simpson on the BBC this morning, he tweeted that Somebody called Igor Gerkin, who used to work for the SFB and is a huge Vladimir Putin supporter, saying that what's happening around Kharkiv is similar to what happened in the battle of Mukden in 1905 when Japan destroyed the tsar's army, and that led to, Ultimately, a generation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it feels very, very special. Just on that one, though, so I think it's a double edged sword, people like Gherkin's comments because he, of course, is using this to now argue for a massive national mobilization. Absolutely. So so the big threat now to Putin is now increasingly coming not from more pro western critics Of the human rights abuses in Ukraine, it's coming from nationalist Russians who feel he's not doing enough. In fact, the Overwhelming Russian population is very much in favour of what's going on as far as one can tell from opinion polls. And there is now big demands on Russian television, on on social media and it seems to be being allowed by the regime demanding national mobilisation and that's including very sinister people like the The Chechen leader who's been out demanding action. So there's a real move now which may mean that this Counterattack, this incredibly successful counterattack may provoke or at least there are people in Russia who are trying to push for it to provoke a very, very brutal mobilization reaction. I I'd also just just one other thing that I was thinking about on this is is the morale collapse because basically what's happened, there's been fantastic jokes From the Ukrainians on social media saying, thank you so much to the Russian military who continue their role as our largest defence supplier with photographs of all these abandoned Russian tanks and Stuff. But, basically, the Russian soldiers don't know what they're fighting for is at the core of the problem. They were told they were going in to deal with Nazis, Then they were told they were gonna go and take Kyiv, then they were told they weren't taking Kyiv. Many of them have deserted. Morale is absolutely rock bottom. They've just been So this amazingly simple deception plan where the Ukrainians just basically said they were gonna attack on the south and then attacked on the east, and the Russians responded by Moving all their troops to the south. I mean, it's a catastrophe. The the other the other thing I I I do agree with you, by the way. The the Stop. The criticism that is coming out, which you've seen a little bit on state TV, you've actually seen it also, TASS, the the official news agency, reporting quite negatively about some of this up. And there's another ex FSB guy, a guy called Srelkov, who said this. Tonight, the capital of our motherland, Moscow, salutes the surrender of Bakayeva, Izium, and Hafa Kupyansk with high altitude fireworks. And this was Putin going to this 875th anniversary party and boasting that they now have the the the biggest Ferris wheel in the world. And it did make him look incredibly out of touch with what's going on. But whether that's being sanctioned and, of course, The other point that that analysts are making about this is that if we should be worried about a strong Russia under Putin, we should also be worried about a weak Russia under Putin because The more that he feels he's either being humiliated or put into a corner, don't forget, his whole strategy has been driven By his insight that the collapse of the Berlin collapse of the Berlin Wall and the break up of the Soviet Union was an utter humiliation. It's all been about rebuilding from that, And he's now being described as having been humiliated by this little guy in a brown vest who goes around, you know, putting out videos every night. So I think he is you know, none of us like, he's a bit low with the queen. None of us really know what's going on inside Vladimir Putin's head, but it's this is these are these are dangerous days the next few days. Very dangerous. And and and remember, we were talking about the fact that during the the classic May Day parade, he he didn't Announced national mobilization when people expected him to. He hasn't used tactical nuclear weapons, but all those options remain to him. Do you think the thing about the draft? I mean, you talked about the opinion polls, and, of course, it's very hard to know whether an opinion poll in Russia means anything. But I wonder whether whether mothers in particular, if you talk about Russian mothers, if there were to be a draft, when they know they do know despite state propaganda that an awful lot of people have been dying, whether that actually will even whether that might be the moment that the people really, really do to So I think it depends partly I mean, I think Putin, Part of him will be thinking about the Afghan experience and, of course, Afghansti, this this Russian Soviet experience in Afghanistan, was one of the things that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was the terrible humiliation of tens of thousands of Soviet soldiers dying year after year and being smuggled back in secret. I I went to see Russian veterans for the Afghan war in Moscow. I went to a bar with them and it's a very, very troubling, disturbing Story and I think that there may be somewhere in Putin's back of his mind because he was a KGB officer, of course, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He he may fear that getting dragged into very deep intractable conflicts, and and, of course, As we've said before, Ukraine is not Afghanistan. Some of these veterans I was with in the buzz had very kind of racist views about Afghanistan. Some of them were respectful, Some sort of talked about worried people but there was also a sense that this was a very much a third world country. Ukraine, of course, the rhetoric is From the ultranash this is really part of Russia. Mhmm. It's it would be more like, I don't know. We keep stupid analogies, but it'd be more like Britain trying to invade Ireland or something. I mean, it's It's it it it causes a much deeper psychic tension amongst Russians. I hope Liz Truss is not listening. We don't wanna put a sword in anybody's head. The other thing that's happening this week that I think will be really interesting if he goes ahead I mean, it'd be interesting whether Putin actually feels he has today in in, in Moscow. But there's this thing called the Shanghai Cooperation Association, which is meeting this week, and this is China. I mean, it's basically called the the sort of dictators club, but it's China, Russia, and they're in they're they're planning to to allow Iran to enter. Great. And and the the the moment is basically It's China, Russia, and a few of the I think it's Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and the Saudis are there or thereabouts. Belarus, they're they're about. And it's and their meeting of it the the the plan. I think this was when they felt they were on the up. They're meeting in Samakand and the with the symbolism of the Silk Road and the great game that they're winning, and so forth. So but I think what Xi what Xi Jinping and the Chinese will be thinking about what's happening in Ukraine at the moment. That is the bit of this that I would really love to know because I think they They must be a bit alarmed. The the they are taking extra heat from the Americans on Taiwan because of what Putin's done. There's no sense of real progress that they thought might So I I think this could be could be interesting. These Chinese Russian relations are kinda long and difficult, but There's definitely, I think, a sense in China, along with sympathy with the anti western rhetoric coming out of Putin, a real sense That Russia failed, that it's humiliated itself, that this is exactly the kind of thing that China would not do. Yeah. And China has been quite careful to Tow a neutral line. They haven't fallen over backwards to provide support for Russia on this. Putin would have expected much, much more support. Remember we were talking about this after the Maybe there was some cunning plan that China was gonna come in hard behind Russia. That that hasn't happened. So I think I mean, you know, I'm again, I'm in on China. I mean, I'm in the heart of this here. I I, came up from Mombasa. There's a huge train line that Chinese that have just built. It's a Chinese train on Chinese rails and it's run by Chinese train operators and arrives on the minute, in Nairobi. The one thing actually very disappointing is it's not a Chinese dining car. I was hoping for delicious Chinese food, but that That that was not coming on the train. But also first ending on on development and things. I mean, one of the things happening here, which you could imagine from British politics, is This train line which is moving all the goods and is meant to move them from the port of Mombasa up to Nairobi and even up to Uganda, both Political candidates have offered in their electoral campaign to stop the train line entirely because the truckers from Mombasa have all lost their jobs. They were supposed to be their jobs were driving the trucks up and down the main road, very polluting, very bad for the environment, totally inefficient, blocks all the roads, But this beautiful new train, which is actually it's extraordinary cost. I mean, people estimate that it's costing 25% of the GDP of Kenya, so huge debt to China trying to pay it off. Both presidential candidates at some point suggested they were just gonna stop the train entirely and go back to driving stuff on trucks. Wow. I do think, by the way, we should recognize, because I don't I don't think the guy gets nearly enough credit for what's happening in Ukraine. The the reason the one of the main reasons for this Extraordinary military turnaround, if that's what it is, has been the the incredible commitment that Joe Biden and the Americans have put into providing the weaponry. And I know Britain's been part of well, and we should recognize that too. But I think Joe Biden has he's and and I think part of his thinking throughout this thing has been in relation to China that because it does it has troubled the Chinese. And I think that Putin now, if he is as desperate as people are saying he is, He will be looking to China for support. If that support is not forthcoming, it weakens his alliance with the Sino Russian alliance. If it is forthcoming, then that is a massive risk that the Chinese are playing vis a vis the Americans. So I think I Could what do I know? But I do think Xi Jinping will be looking at Putin rather differently than he was at the, Winter Olympics. Yeah, the United States is such a central player in all this stuff, so I think even last month they were well over $50,000,000,000 of assistance to Ukraine And incredible weaponry there, Freddie. And as countryside Britain, very sadly, you know, Our budgets are under pressure. We're cutting international development, something we've talked about a lot. I believe in the latest humanitarian response In the Horn of Africa, the United States is carrying 93% of the burden, financial burden of that, extreme famine humanitarian response to drought, as players like the United Kingdom but also the European Union are really not doing as much as the United States in these areas. America's carrying a lot of burden around the world and and it's it's sad in a way that actually other players haven't stepped up as much as one hopes because, of course, America, you You know, it's still about the same size world economy as it's been for many decades, but you would have thought these emerging powers would begin to play a bigger role in this stuff, and they haven't quite stepped up. Well, there we are. I think we've we've we said we were going to do the Queen, Ukraine, Kenya, Sweden. Anything else you'd like to tell the grateful public, Rory? Yeah. Great for public. Well, what we wanna know, actually, I see you're you're you're seeing maybe this is unfair, but you're seeming a little bit chirpier than when we saw you last week. Are you feeling a bit better, or is Or is it still a bit tough? No. No. I'm feeling a lot better. I feel a lot better. Thank you thank you for asking. I do feel a lot better. I feel I'm definitely through the worst. I had a peak when we recorded. I think it was 2 or 3 was it 2 or 3 weeks ago, when I was really, really bad. And then about a week to 10 days where I was struggling, and I feel I'm I'm through the other side, which is a nice nice thing. And and I just better warn you, Roy, that when I get through the other side, I I can get I can start again with the 4 AM email saying, what the hell is going on? Why aren't we doing this? So the the the the the the man the manic side kicks in a bit, But, no, thank you for asking. I've got I've got my I've got my mojo back. Okay. Well, lots of love, and see you for question time.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSo welcome to another episode of The Rest is Politics with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we are gonna be talking about elections in Sweden and in Kenya. We're gonna be talking about the extraordinary events that unfolded in the last few days in, Ukraine. But, inevitably, we're gonna start with, the death of the queen. A bit weird for both of us, Rory, because neither of us were in the country, and I'm not suggesting too. That that would have affected very much.\n\nBut I don't know about you in Uganda, but it felt a bit strange being in Albania as Yeah. The country was convulsed.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's strange. Are you are you a privy councilor at the moment? Were you putting the privy council as part of\n\nSpeaker 0: your No. I was never made a privy council. Thank god. I don't as you know, I don't believe in titles.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so so as it probably counts, so theoretically, I could have been there at the acclamation service for the for the new king. So I I felt sorry to miss out on that. Although I think they're doing it on a lottery, so I I probably wouldn't have made it in there anyway. So, Yes. One of the things I think I've I've seen you talking a bit about on Twitter is the question of the coverage of the queen.\n\nAlthough most of the coverage I've been picking up is in the nation and the standard, which Kenyan newspapers and then Uganda newspapers, where I must say the coverage has been extraordinary day after day front page coverage in Uganda and Kenya. I was in, a drought affected area of rural Kalifi yesterday, which is, you know, pretty remote, 3 hours on dusty roads, and Union Jack at half mast outside a building, the Kenyan president has announced national mourning, people are wearing black ties In in Cuba, for goodness sake, and this is a lovely little thing on Twitter coming from my friend Ben Judah saying it's going to create real cognitive dissonance for the kind of classic Pro Cuban Republicans to find that the Cuban government has also announced national mourning and put its flags at half mast or queen.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is extraordinary. I do think the the the international response was even though we knew it would be huge, it was extraordinary. I thought that some of the images, seeing the Sydney Opera House with the picture of the queen in the middle bit of that extraordinary construction. I thought the Brandenburg Gate done up as the as the Union Jack was extraordinary. I thought Macron speech, both in French and English, particularly in light of Liz Truss' friend or foe.\n\nThe jury is out. I thought he I thought he won The foreign tributes. He said\n\nSpeaker 1: he was. He's so graceful, isn't he? And so graceful but but just Justin Trudeau as well, though, I thought was wonderful. Really moving and\n\nSpeaker 0: But the for the what was what was what was interesting, like, Dan Dan, where we, have a place in France, the the local paper, La Provence, Page after page after page and pictures, and and lots of I I did it I I've actually not done I see you've done a few. I had I'm sure you did And everybody dead who's had any connection ever with this extraordinary woman and this remarkable story, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of bids to talk about it. And I actually decided just not to do any. I felt that was easier. And I actually think it's one of those stories where you really There's so much what I call just the blah factory, whereas actually, the stuff that really matters is the is the event itself.\n\nIt's in the planning. It's what the people who really matter are saying and doing. So I do think that actually seeing those interviews with the former prime ministers was really interesting. I do think that watching the family and and their reactions so forth. But I do I do think there's you mentioned the coverage.\n\nI thought the BBC got it Absolutely Right. I thought Hugh Edwards was brilliant. Hugh Edwards, I interviewed him for Men's Health a few months ago, and he he actually said to me that he He thought the death of the queen would the biggest be the biggest test of the BBC in its history, and he also revealed to me that he he practiced for hours in front of his mirror for the moment. And that sounds a bit disrespectful, but I just it's the old Benjamin Franklin thing, fail to prepare, and you're preparing to fail. And he did it absolutely brilliantly.\n\nBut then I think once we got through the 1st day, by the time I was back from Albania, we're on to sort of day 3. And then, you know, recent days in particular, where you you literally had to watch foreign media to find out what was going on anywhere else in the world. And And I think I do think that, obviously, she's she was incredibly popular, hugely loved around the country and around the world. But I do think this kind of this absolute mononarrative that everybody has to be saying everything was wonderful, and everybody has to be Just cloyingly sort of supportive and pro. And I I'm not saying, you know, we should have had lots of sort of people covering this or the other.\n\nBut then it led to this extraordinary thing on Sky News where there was a protest by the family and their supporters of somebody, a guy called Chris Kaba, who'd been killed. And there was a protest against police conduct. And so there's these aerial pictures of this protest. The sky you said are there. There are people marching towards Buckingham Palace to take their respects because they're just and to be fair to them, they apologize that it's it was a mistake.\n\nYeah. But it's what happens when you get into this monotone. Yep. And I think we've just gotta be a bit careful.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think I'm sure I think we should probably should be a bit careful. But thank goodness it doesn't happen very often to have a monarch who, lasted 70 years. I mean, it's Strong.\n\nSpeaker 0: Incredible. It is incredible. Sorry. I agree.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, the I'm trying to think of this. I mean, in a way, you're right. I mean, I I I did one Brief interview on the Today program, and I've otherwise stayed off completely because I think that there's not a great deal that you can say. I mean, One of the things that I think was part of her genius was she was extremely, well, extremely discreet and extremely restrained. I remember when I got made a privy counsellor, I knew her- I knew her Majesty a little bit and So I was expecting when I went to get you, when you become a secretary set, you go to get these kind of stamps of office, which you can give to your kids to put in candle wax And go around stamping things with, sort of gold chains of office.\n\nSo I went to receive them in this very kind of formal thing in Windsor Castle and I was expecting a sort of wink or a smile or some sort of recognition of the fact that that she knew me, but she was so Absolutely professional. Very much played it very straight. No distinction between me and anybody else who was being made a minister at the time.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think I think The Daily I think The Daily Mail will love this story. Rory Stewart heard that Queen didn't rat at him.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is very much not what I'm saying.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I guess spacey wigged at me.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I guess what I'm saying is that that she, As a result, I mean, I think it was exactly the right thing to do, right? She's, she's the queen, she's swearing in sexually estate, there's Absolutely formal. No favouritism. Nothing personal going on. But that does mean that some of the encounters that people, I think, have been relating, They're trying to squeeze an enormous amount out of somebody who I think with her friends, you know, I definitely wasn't one of her friends.\n\nI think with one of her friends in private, she could relax more, but I think Most of us who are encountering public, we're encountering a pretty formal person from whom you're not extracting a huge number of anecdotes.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I love the the line by Tina Brown. Oh, here we go again promoting the New York Times. Tina Brown wrote a a piece in the in the New York Times. She had it was my favorite line of the whole week. She said, we're so going to miss not knowing what she thinks.\n\nI thought that was absolutely brilliant because you don't know what she thinks. I mean, people, I read all those pieces over the over the the the weekend, and all the political correspondents sort of feel they have to get in on the act. So they're writing big, long pieces about Who were her favorite prime ministers and and so forth? And they don't know. The truth is they do not know.\n\nAnd little myths develop. Like, She didn't like Tony Blair because he's, quote, saved her when Diana died. She didn't like Thatcher because she was another strong woman. I think these mythologies just develop, and then they, She really liked Harold Wilson. She really liked John Major because he came from a humble background.\n\nWe don't know any of that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Which is a great tribute to her, but you're quite right. I think that's a good thing to move on to and conclude on that because we don't have a great deal to say.\n\nSpeaker 0: We don't Well, I just really did. I there's actually 1 bit I do want to talk about it, because I don't think I don't think it has been given enough sort of thought amidst all this. And and that is that and I I wrote a book called Winners 7 years ago. And I I actually ended up writing a chapter about the Queen as a very British enduring British winner. And I spoke to a lot of the people who worked for her down the years and because I got to know them during that week of Diana's death.\n\nAnd I do think it's important to recognize this is a point about leadership. Even though prince Philip viewed strategy as something only people like Stalin and Hitler talked about. I think the Queen was remarkably strategic, and I think that her ability to lead and adapt to a world of change while staying the same. And talking to these guys who were I'm not, you know, bullshitting here. They were genuinely close to her.\n\nThey were part of the operation that sheet led and so forth. And then when they explained to it, it was this whole thing about how do you they they they talked about the famous novel, The Leopard by, Lamped his team. You know, everything must change, everything needs to change so that everything can stay the same. That was the approach. And I just think that that I think we should recognize the kind of it is a form of genius, and, you know, I I have been a Republican all of my life.\n\nMy 1st ever row with my mother was about not wanting to watch the Queen's speech when I was about 7, and she made me. And and yet you have to recognize that, I think in large part down to her and what she's done over the 70 years, but particularly since Anna Cerebralas when they decided they had to make change. And then again after Diana's death, I think they made changes. She gave the go ahead for that. But, ultimately, what we're seeing at the moment is the celebration of her and the institution rather than the changes, which is an incredible feat.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Extraordinary. Incidentally, by the way, on on book recommendations, I I've read a wonderful biography Of of Lanpaduser, the the guy that rode the leopard. So, I I I it's called The Last Leopard,\n\nSpeaker 0: and\n\nSpeaker 1: it's by David Gilmour. And so anyone interest it's an amazing book, amazing film too. You'd seen that great black and white film.\n\nSpeaker 0: I can hear, yet again, Bow down to your extraordinary vastness of knowledge because you did not we did not, in any prior discussion, discuss the fact that I was going to to raise the leopard. So well done on that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. No. It's it's my friend Felix is obsessed for the film, amazing black and white film. I tried to tried to watch it with the family, and they got really bored. So may maybe it's not for everyone.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now I know you as the arch royalist keep wanting to move off, but I want to come back to something, And that was Prince Charles and the inkwell. Oh. You mentioned the did you ever see this? No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I didn't see the inkwell. No.\n\nSpeaker 0: So when when at the at the meeting of the Privy Council where he was sworn in. And I have to say, I thought I thought Penny Morton was a brilliant emcee. She really did very, very well. But when prince Charles they all had to sign the the thing that they were reading out. And prince William, I remember my daughter watching and saying she was very excited that prince William was left handed because she's left handed.\n\nShe's left handed. People are superior. But when Charles was sat down to sign it, he got very, very tetchy because there was an inkwell in the way. Oh, I see. And he waved it away very angrily in a way that we all sort of turned to each other and said, god, the queen would never have done that.\n\nIt was a very you should look it up. It's a very, very interesting moment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Look at that moment. It must be a very tense tense moment. I was sorry I wasn't there, actually. I mean, I it was my mother Thought the only point to my becoming a privy councilor was so that I'd be able to do that, turn up to stand somewhere behind Tony Blair and the line of people in black seats.\n\nSpeaker 0: It it was funny watching, everybody trying to sort of photobomb this. They'd obviously lined up the 6 prime ministers. Yep. Keir Starmer Keir Starmer was standing next to Tony Blair, and they were chatting away. Gordon Brown got the very, very short straw because he was he was next to Boris Johnson, and then there was a bit of a gap.\n\nSo he had to sort of talk to him quite a lot. And then Tessa Blackstone, I noticed, got in between Theresa May and John Major. So The picture of the 6 never it it was never totally clean. But it wasn't it wasn't an extraordinary event, and, it was It was yeah. It was I I did find the whole thing very moving.\n\nAnd and yesterday, Fiona and I went down to the to the palace and just sort of milling around. And, because during the the week after Diana's death, I was because I was settling backwards and forwards to the palace when we were planning the funeral. I got the feeling there were more I think there were more people around that week. But, actually, when we were walking away, I realized that the The police and the crowd control, they were they were spreading the crowd. So the flowers actually were being laid for a long, long way from the palace.\n\nWell And it was pretty it was a pretty extraordinary thing. So\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's amazing. I mean, maybe in question time, we can get back to this because people have obviously asked whether this The time to rethink the monarchy and republicanism and things. And I think there's some interesting things to be said about that. But you had something on the Swedish elections. Tell us about Swedish elections.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is going out, I think, Wednesday morning, and it may be clearer. We're recording on on Monday. But it it does look pretty seismic what's happening in Sweden because the the ill named Sweden Democrats, have got looked like they're gonna get about 21% 20% of the vote. And the Sweden Democrats are a party that emerged from the Neo Nazis in the eighties. They've done a bit of a rebranding job.\n\nThey kicked out some of the real kind of, you know, Jean Marie Le Pen types. But they're very, very right wing. There's been a lot of gang violence going on in Sweden. They've been, you know, focused on that. Scandinavia has such a wonderful reputation in the in the rest of the developed world.\n\nWe also talk about the Scandies. And so the Social Democrats are are are gonna be the biggest party, But because the Sweden Democrats are coming 2nd and then their kind of, I guess, equivalent of our Tory party is the mod they call themselves the moderates. And I think what's going to happen, if if it does go this way, and it literally is on a knife edge, they're now waiting for overseas votes to come in, And it's so close that that may swing it either way. But it but it will be an extraordinary thing. And even for them to get 1 in 5 of the Swedish vote for this far right party, that its campaign mainly on immigration is a pretty extraordinary thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's amazing. And the immigration story is amazing in Sweden, because Sweden has been incredibly good about reaching out to asylum seekers and has taken a country which was very ethnically homogeneous In a very short period of time towards a situation where now I think 30% of the Swedish population don't have Swedish as their mother tongue and that's, You know, almost half the population in some areas of cities. So there's part of that going on. They they had, You told me about this just before we went on the podcast, so this is not me showing some amazing knowledge. I just popped on the Guardian website, but one of the things I noticed There was, that they'd campaigned, the Swedish Democrats, this Nazi originating party with a metro train decorated in their Electoral colors called the Repatriation Express with one way ticket, next stop Kabul, and they were sort of driving this underground train through through stations.\n\nSpeaker 0: And it just shows that that sort of nativist, populist, really quite nasty campaigning can strike a chord. They've grown with every one of the last Half dozen elections or so. They've just grown and grown and grown and grown. They've got this quite charismatic leader, Jimmy Akesson, who started out I think he was about 25, and he's now he's now been there 10 years. So quite young still.\n\nBut I think it will be you know, if they do have to form the government, That will that's a big moment for for Scandinavia and and indeed for the European Union. And we and, you know, we've talked so much about this. So we're back to this whole thing about The power of the force of populism, whether the established parties and governments did take the the concerns about immigration seriously, whether they're just Being exploited or or have you, the whole thing. I think I do think that it'll be interesting again to see whether social media and the abuse of technology has been part of this as it has been of so many of the other elections where this is taking place.\n\nSpeaker 1: So on on this bigger issue, because you're you're you're framing the big strategic issue, I really believe that we are in the middle of an age of populism and it's an age of populism that really got going sort of 2014 to 16, so that's kind of Modi, Bolsonaro, Trump, Brexit, etcetera. And there was a moment with Joe Biden's election and Trump's defeat Where it felt as though maybe the pension was swinging back in another direction, but I think the underlying drivers of populism, Which go all the way back to the 2008 financial crisis and inequality and problems of globalization and social media Are very, very durable and that sadly what we're seeing, that, you know, we get these moments of what seem to be good news, macroselection, for example, But as you've pointed out, under the surface of Macron selection is something very, very worrying, which is actually the the the stronger trend is the deep development of these Far left, far right parties, and a real worry about one another replaces him.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, the other thing, of course, is is the This is going to be worsened by the conjunction of the energy crisis and the Ukraine war you're already seeing. And the fact that Liz Truss can even appoint somebody like Jacob Rees Mogg to be the business secretary when business we know, I think, does have Actually, the the center of gravity in business is actually concerned about the future of the environment, but the whole net zero campaign, this is that's the next sort of target for the for the populist right. And you can see how easy that's going to be for them. Your bills are going up. Why should you pay the price to save the planet for future generations?\n\nIt's almost like, you know, what have future generations ever done for me? And that's the game that they're going to play.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and, of course, the problem is that one of the things that the particularly right wing governments attempted to do is effectively put the burden on the very poorest because what they're doing is they're Trying to put a carbon tax on the consumption of carbon, which has a good economic logic, I mean, it makes sense for an economist, But the truth is that that carbon consumption is a much larger proportion of the budget of somebody who's poor than somebody who's wealthy. So\n\nSpeaker 0: It would it would have been very interesting, Marie, if The if the queen had not died when on the day that she did and it was kind of extraordinary. There's Liz Truss, a new prime minister, on her feet in the House of Commons announcing this extraordinarily large energy crisis package and a very, very, very clear dividing line emerging where She thinks this should be not be paid for by windfall tax. It should be paid by borrowing and load loading onto future generations. The thing that they've said during the leadership election, they would never do. And Keir Starmer very, very clear that it should be.\n\nAnd I thought I don't know if you saw any of the debate. I I did think it was one of Keir Starmer's better moments than that. I thought he really It was pretty clear and pretty strong and very, very the the dividing line was clear. And, of course, that debate has now just vanished for now. Yeah.\n\nBut it's going to come back, and It'll be very interesting to see how that plays out.\n\nSpeaker 1: We'll come back very soon because you're you're quite right. There's been an enormous amount of coverage of the new king, but I I think that's something that will pass very quickly and then we'll be back to the brutal reality of what's happening in our economy. On the Clytemnstein, I'm speaking to you from from Kenya, from Nairobi, where the new president, Ruto? Yep. William Ruto is going to be, sworn in, inaugurated tomorrow.\n\nI was actually at the last inauguration of, here of Uhuru Kenyatta, his predecessor. This is another classic popular story. So in this case in Kenya, the old establishment really tried to come together, and it felt as though they could really guarantee stitching up the election. So Adinga represents the Luo community and Kenyatta, the previous president, got behind him. And he represents the Kikuyu community and it felt like There was no way they could be defeated.\n\nThe maths were all in their favour. And it was a classic campaign run by an older man and Ruto, who was very much the insurgent, younger, being part of political youth movements, actually a history of violence, Was indicted by the International Criminal Court but very much self made. I mean, Adinga's father, Kenyatta's father were Huge politicians in their own right. William Ritu ran a campaign called Hustler Nation and he's the hustler, came from nothing, built a fortune.\n\nSpeaker 0: He's very Trumpian.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very Trumpian. Very, very Trumpian and very much a strong man and very much, you know, challenging a lot of the orthodoxies. And, But a bit like Trump also got some right wing economists on side by talking quite a extreme line on on, on economics. And it it was one of these classic, results where Mombasa, which was supposed to be the real heartland that that was meant to be delivering. Fruitinga didn't really turn out, didn't really vote for him in the way they were supposed to, and the Luo turnouts were low, And the cuckoo vote was split and he got his base out.\n\nI mean, this is one of the things the populists do so well. He got that base out and voting when people thought he couldn't, And he's taken the election. And it's a real sign both of troubling populism, but also a very positive sign because it's broken It's broken the stranglehold.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's Britain's\n\nSpeaker 1: trying to hold of the old establishment. It's broken the idea that it's all defined by ethnicity. It it isn't anymore in Kenya for the first time. And the election result was upheld, and there wasn't the widespread violence that people were predicting. So in many ways, it's a really the institutions worked.\n\nIt's a very impressive live Kenya democracy.\n\nSpeaker 0: We had a few critics this week, Roy. I don't even know if you noticed in the questions that people saying that that I I thought this is very unfair, but they Thought that we were a bit belittling of what was happening in Chile last week. I don't think we were belittling at all. I think we were we were shocked that the result was so big given that so many people had wanted a new constitution.\n\nSpeaker 1: Think we were belittling? What did\n\nSpeaker 0: they do? I don't know. I think because I think because we laughed at the point during the and maybe that's just our\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 0: Our humor coming out too too much.\n\nSpeaker 1: We shouldn't laugh too much. I shouldn't laugh too much. There's one more thing on Kenya quickly before we go to Ukraine. I I was, in these very drought affected areas, in Caliphate yesterday. And if you want to see climate change in action, generally people tell stories from things like Lake Chad, which is famously retreating 500 metres a year, so villages eventually are just too far away to even walk for the water, or they talk Stories for Somalia, they don't focus more on the much more complicated, but much more, almost much more worrying story of climate change, which is the way that it's happening In almost every country of the world, and it's a more complicated story.\n\nSo in the case of Kenya, I was in villages which Givrach had been supporting, but which had been hit Very hard by drought. So you'd go into the maze granaries and there was no maze because the entire crop had been wiped out, just shriveled husks From last year's, you could see the bones on the cows. 1 woman I was talking to had lost, all her livestock. I went out with the young men who were walking their cows out forage. They're now walking miles and miles and miles to try to get a scrap of grass to keep them alive.\n\nAnd it's micro climate stuff. Part of the reason why it's a difficult story to tell is we then drove another 25 miles and found a village where there actually had been some rainfall and everybody was much better off. But I very difficult for journalists to tell these stories because I don't know whether editors can really bring them alive for British voters. But if you want to see climate change and how devastating it's being and why 200,000,000 more people are likely to be pushed into poverty. We've got to learn how to tell these sort of micro stories from places like Kenya.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I think the problem with the whole debate on climate change is that the media large parts of the media in the mail, they don't cover climate change. They cover the weather. It's about the so so we hear about it when we see these flash floods and we see, you know, Pakistan underwater, And and and it's about the rescue, and it's about the operation. But actually, bizarrely, the lot the the the the more impactful these events have been, I think we're actually having less debate about climate change than we did. So and what you're saying there, I mean, even as you were saying that, I was imagining a journalist going in to an editorial meeting and saying, let's go and do something about how climate change is affecting farming in Kenya.\n\nAre they gonna look at you and say, well, you know, Shouldn't we be doing shouldn't we be doing something else about prince Charles? Anyway, should we should we should we take a break and come back and and talk about extraordinary events in Ukraine?\n\nSpeaker 1: We will. Thank you. Welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And we we were moving on to the extraordinary developments In Ukraine, do you just wanna remind us what's been happening over the last few days?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I mean, I do think if it hadn't been for the for the queen, This would have been, like, huge news. And in fact, even though the Queen has been the main story in pretty much every country in the world, I have been even more than usually getting my news from foreign sources because I think people have realized this is I think, potentially, it's extraordinary. And when you when you have people like Laurie Freedman, the Historian at King's talking about this being a a tipping point, then you have to take that seriously. I mean, Zelensky is is saying and you've got to be careful with this because the the media can't get to the front line. A lot of the information that we're getting is from Telegram videos that have been posted and and from official Ukrainian claims.\n\nWhat they're talking about, as of now as of today, as we're speaking, more than 3,000 square kilometers being taken, including these these very, very important Supply line places, Izium and Kupyans, and and the Russians admitting that they've had to the phrase they use was retreat to regroup. And you're also seeing some extraordinary I noticed John Simpson on the BBC this morning, he tweeted that Somebody called Igor Gerkin, who used to work for the SFB and is a huge Vladimir Putin supporter, saying that what's happening around Kharkiv is similar to what happened in the battle of Mukden in 1905 when Japan destroyed the tsar's army, and that led to, Ultimately, a generation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSo it feels very, very special.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just on that one, though, so I think it's a double edged sword, people like Gherkin's comments because he, of course, is using this to now argue for a massive national mobilization. Absolutely. So so the big threat now to Putin is now increasingly coming not from more pro western critics Of the human rights abuses in Ukraine, it's coming from nationalist Russians who feel he's not doing enough. In fact, the Overwhelming Russian population is very much in favour of what's going on as far as one can tell from opinion polls. And there is now big demands on Russian television, on on social media and it seems to be being allowed by the regime demanding national mobilisation and that's including very sinister people like the The Chechen leader who's been out demanding action.\n\nSo there's a real move now which may mean that this Counterattack, this incredibly successful counterattack may provoke or at least there are people in Russia who are trying to push for it to provoke a very, very brutal mobilization reaction. I I'd also just just one other thing that I was thinking about on this is is the morale collapse because basically what's happened, there's been fantastic jokes From the Ukrainians on social media saying, thank you so much to the Russian military who continue their role as our largest defence supplier with photographs of all these abandoned Russian tanks and Stuff. But, basically, the Russian soldiers don't know what they're fighting for is at the core of the problem. They were told they were going in to deal with Nazis, Then they were told they were gonna go and take Kyiv, then they were told they weren't taking Kyiv. Many of them have deserted.\n\nMorale is absolutely rock bottom. They've just been So this amazingly simple deception plan where the Ukrainians just basically said they were gonna attack on the south and then attacked on the east, and the Russians responded by Moving all their troops to the south. I mean, it's a catastrophe.\n\nSpeaker 0: The the other the other thing I I I do agree with you, by the way. The the Stop. The criticism that is coming out, which you've seen a little bit on state TV, you've actually seen it also, TASS, the the official news agency, reporting quite negatively about some of this up. And there's another ex FSB guy, a guy called Srelkov, who said this. Tonight, the capital of our motherland, Moscow, salutes the surrender of Bakayeva, Izium, and Hafa Kupyansk with high altitude fireworks.\n\nAnd this was Putin going to this 875th anniversary party and boasting that they now have the the the biggest Ferris wheel in the world. And it did make him look incredibly out of touch with what's going on. But whether that's being sanctioned and, of course, The other point that that analysts are making about this is that if we should be worried about a strong Russia under Putin, we should also be worried about a weak Russia under Putin because The more that he feels he's either being humiliated or put into a corner, don't forget, his whole strategy has been driven By his insight that the collapse of the Berlin collapse of the Berlin Wall and the break up of the Soviet Union was an utter humiliation. It's all been about rebuilding from that, And he's now being described as having been humiliated by this little guy in a brown vest who goes around, you know, putting out videos every night. So I think he is you know, none of us like, he's a bit low with the queen.\n\nNone of us really know what's going on inside Vladimir Putin's head, but it's this is these are these are dangerous days the next few days.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very dangerous. And and and remember, we were talking about the fact that during the the classic May Day parade, he he didn't Announced national mobilization when people expected him to. He hasn't used tactical nuclear weapons, but all those options remain to him.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think the thing about the draft? I mean, you talked about the opinion polls, and, of course, it's very hard to know whether an opinion poll in Russia means anything. But I wonder whether whether mothers in particular, if you talk about Russian mothers, if there were to be a draft, when they know they do know despite state propaganda that an awful lot of people have been dying, whether that actually will even whether that might be the moment that the people really, really do to\n\nSpeaker 1: So I think it depends partly I mean, I think Putin, Part of him will be thinking about the Afghan experience and, of course, Afghansti, this this Russian Soviet experience in Afghanistan, was one of the things that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was the terrible humiliation of tens of thousands of Soviet soldiers dying year after year and being smuggled back in secret. I I went to see Russian veterans for the Afghan war in Moscow. I went to a bar with them and it's a very, very troubling, disturbing Story and I think that there may be somewhere in Putin's back of his mind because he was a KGB officer, of course, before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He he may fear that getting dragged into very deep intractable conflicts, and and, of course, As we've said before, Ukraine is not Afghanistan.\n\nSome of these veterans I was with in the buzz had very kind of racist views about Afghanistan. Some of them were respectful, Some sort of talked about worried people but there was also a sense that this was a very much a third world country. Ukraine, of course, the rhetoric is From the ultranash this is really part of Russia. Mhmm. It's it would be more like, I don't know.\n\nWe keep stupid analogies, but it'd be more like Britain trying to invade Ireland or something. I mean, it's It's it it it causes a much deeper psychic tension amongst Russians.\n\nSpeaker 0: I hope Liz Truss is not listening. We don't wanna put a sword in anybody's head. The other thing that's happening this week that I think will be really interesting if he goes ahead I mean, it'd be interesting whether Putin actually feels he has today in in, in Moscow. But there's this thing called the Shanghai Cooperation Association, which is meeting this week, and this is China. I mean, it's basically called the the sort of dictators club, but it's China, Russia, and they're in they're they're planning to to allow Iran to enter.\n\nGreat. And and the the the moment is basically It's China, Russia, and a few of the I think it's Pakistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and the Saudis are there or thereabouts. Belarus, they're they're about. And it's and their meeting of it the the the plan. I think this was when they felt they were on the up.\n\nThey're meeting in Samakand and the with the symbolism of the Silk Road and the great game that they're winning, and so forth. So but I think what Xi what Xi Jinping and the Chinese will be thinking about what's happening in Ukraine at the moment. That is the bit of this that I would really love to know because I think they They must be a bit alarmed. The the they are taking extra heat from the Americans on Taiwan because of what Putin's done. There's no sense of real progress that they thought might So I I think this could be could be interesting.\n\nSpeaker 1: These Chinese Russian relations are kinda long and difficult, but There's definitely, I think, a sense in China, along with sympathy with the anti western rhetoric coming out of Putin, a real sense That Russia failed, that it's humiliated itself, that this is exactly the kind of thing that China would not do. Yeah. And China has been quite careful to Tow a neutral line. They haven't fallen over backwards to provide support for Russia on this. Putin would have expected much, much more support.\n\nRemember we were talking about this after the Maybe there was some cunning plan that China was gonna come in hard behind Russia. That that hasn't happened. So I think I mean, you know, I'm again, I'm in on China. I mean, I'm in the heart of this here. I I, came up from Mombasa.\n\nThere's a huge train line that Chinese that have just built. It's a Chinese train on Chinese rails and it's run by Chinese train operators and arrives on the minute, in Nairobi. The one thing actually very disappointing is it's not a Chinese dining car. I was hoping for delicious Chinese food, but that That that was not coming on the train. But also first ending on on development and things.\n\nI mean, one of the things happening here, which you could imagine from British politics, is This train line which is moving all the goods and is meant to move them from the port of Mombasa up to Nairobi and even up to Uganda, both Political candidates have offered in their electoral campaign to stop the train line entirely because the truckers from Mombasa have all lost their jobs. They were supposed to be their jobs were driving the trucks up and down the main road, very polluting, very bad for the environment, totally inefficient, blocks all the roads, But this beautiful new train, which is actually it's extraordinary cost. I mean, people estimate that it's costing 25% of the GDP of Kenya, so huge debt to China trying to pay it off. Both presidential candidates at some point suggested they were just gonna stop the train entirely and go back to driving stuff on trucks.\n\nSpeaker 0: Wow. I do think, by the way, we should recognize, because I don't I don't think the guy gets nearly enough credit for what's happening in Ukraine. The the reason the one of the main reasons for this Extraordinary military turnaround, if that's what it is, has been the the incredible commitment that Joe Biden and the Americans have put into providing the weaponry. And I know Britain's been part of well, and we should recognize that too. But I think Joe Biden has he's and and I think part of his thinking throughout this thing has been in relation to China that because it does it has troubled the Chinese.\n\nAnd I think that Putin now, if he is as desperate as people are saying he is, He will be looking to China for support. If that support is not forthcoming, it weakens his alliance with the Sino Russian alliance. If it is forthcoming, then that is a massive risk that the Chinese are playing vis a vis the Americans. So I think I Could what do I know? But I do think Xi Jinping will be looking at Putin rather differently than he was at the, Winter Olympics.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, the United States is such a central player in all this stuff, so I think even last month they were well over $50,000,000,000 of assistance to Ukraine And incredible weaponry there, Freddie. And as countryside Britain, very sadly, you know, Our budgets are under pressure. We're cutting international development, something we've talked about a lot. I believe in the latest humanitarian response In the Horn of Africa, the United States is carrying 93% of the burden, financial burden of that, extreme famine humanitarian response to drought, as players like the United Kingdom but also the European Union are really not doing as much as the United States in these areas. America's carrying a lot of burden around the world and and it's it's sad in a way that actually other players haven't stepped up as much as one hopes because, of course, America, you You know, it's still about the same size world economy as it's been for many decades, but you would have thought these emerging powers would begin to play a bigger role in this stuff, and they haven't quite stepped up.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, there we are. I think we've we've we said we were going to do the Queen, Ukraine, Kenya, Sweden. Anything else you'd like to tell the grateful public, Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Great for public. Well, what we wanna know, actually, I see you're you're you're seeing maybe this is unfair, but you're seeming a little bit chirpier than when we saw you last week. Are you feeling a bit better, or is Or is it still a bit tough?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. I'm feeling a lot better. I feel a lot better. Thank you thank you for asking.\n\nI do feel a lot better. I feel I'm definitely through the worst. I had a peak when we recorded. I think it was 2 or 3 was it 2 or 3 weeks ago, when I was really, really bad. And then about a week to 10 days where I was struggling, and I feel I'm I'm through the other side, which is a nice nice thing.\n\nAnd and I just better warn you, Roy, that when I get through the other side, I I can get I can start again with the 4 AM email saying, what the hell is going on? Why aren't we doing this? So the the the the the the man the manic side kicks in a bit, But, no, thank you for asking. I've got I've got my I've got my mojo back.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, lots of love, and see you for question time.",
