Subscribe to Built For Change now so you don't miss an episode. Question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And I want to start, Rory, with a question that shows the unbelievable prescience of some of our listeners. This is a question that we got last October, 3rd October, from somebody called George Rose. How scared should we be about current Credit Suisse CDS levels? Did the global financial systems learn anything from 2008? Well, I mean Why did we not answer that at the time? Exactly. So firstly for listeners, CDS's credit default swaps, And that is what 6 days ago really began the collapse of Credit Suisse, but, obviously, George Rose was onto it in October. And is this related to the Silicon Valley Bank problems? Is this a domino thing going on? Yes. Absolutely. Basically, People were so panicked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank that they began looking around for other banks to be panicked by, and people began withdrawing money from one of the weaker of the major banks of the world, which is Credit Suisse, and essentially started a bank run. And the result was the Saudi, state fund refused to keep funding them. And in the end, the other great Swiss bank, UBS, has had to step in and buy out Credit Suisse, and they've bought it For a fraction of its theoretical book value. I mean, they've bought it for a few 1,000,000,000. So does that mean if you have money now with Credit Suisse, that your money is now worth less or not. If you had certain kinds of instruments, more fancy instruments, not a normal depositor. A normal depositor should be insured by the Swiss Central Bank. But, yes, people with fancy instruments may be in real trouble. And this is about people buying, high risk, High return instruments, but assuming that they're safe, finding out that they're not safe. And is and part of the reason, as I understand it with the Silicon Valley Bank, Is that you and I might have our money in a bank, and we think that's where the money stays. But in fact, that bank we're putting into other banks that may be less reliable. Whole whole series of things. You're completely right. So there's the issue of the credit default swap, which is a mechanism where a bank tries to insure itself by getting another type of instrument, which insures itself against credit default, insures itself against Losing money on optical instrument. And these things get more and more complicated, and this was one of the problems in the 2008 financial crisis. But in this particular case, Part of the problem is the way that we've regulated since 2008 and, in particular, pushing people to put more and more pushing banks put more and more of their money into government bonds. And the reason why they did that is that government bonds hold their value. So in 10 years' time, you can cash in your government bond, and the US treasury is not gonna default on the government bond. But in the short term, if you are forced to sell Because there's been a bank run, your government bond, you can be selling it for much less than it's worth. And this has also been affected by the fact that as Interest rates have gone up. The value of the bonds have gone down. This is a weird mechanism. It's not that weird. But, effectively, the price of the bonds It's inversely related to the rising interest rates. So two things, the way in which these banks were regulated after 2008, and the second thing, which is the rise in interest rates, has created this real weakness at the heart of the system. And banks that were less well managed, Silicon Valley Bank seems to be one example, But Credit Suisse, even more dramatically, they've been through 3 CEOs in 3 years. They've had a series of catastrophic scandals. They've lost a lot of money. So, clearly, George Rose, who asked that question, was one of the people who, by October last year, was already At his point, have they learned anything from 2008? What you're saying was just no. Well, unfortunately, the regulators would say they learned something from 2008, but what they did then created a whole series of different types of problem. But, yes, George is right that one of the problems is the complexity of these things. And I was talking to a banker yesterday about the balance sheet of Credit Suisse. And he said, one thing that nobody ever explains to you is that these banks are so big, So complicated that nobody understands them. Literally nobody. You can read the balance sheet of these banks, and it makes zero sense. Because at one point, Credit Suisse had over $1,000,000,000,000 of assets under management, and they are every type of And it doesn't matter how big your brain is or almost how big your computer system is. Nobody has any idea whether Credit Suisse It's worth minus a 100,000,000,000 or whether it's worth plus 100,000,000,000. And Presumably the same we could say the same for a lot of the banks that are not currently in a mess. 100% because they they are so long as nobody's withdrawing their assets Yeah. There's not a bank run happening. Nobody semblance of security. Yeah. Nobody needs to really get into the question of what these things are actually worth. But, yes, again, we are being forced to confront The potential unraveling of our financial system. Bernie Bernie Sanders is right. It's okay to be angry about capitalism. And it's gonna get, I think, even worse because Since 2008, more and more and more of what's happening in these banks is, of course, automated, done by incredibly complicated computer systems now reinforced by AI algorithms so that almost nobody has any idea what's actually happening within these mechanisms. Yeah. Okay. My favorite question to me, Rory, Andrew Hoffman. Rory is the only person I know who says things like goodness and mercy me. Does he ever swear? You swore on the Iraq podcast. I did. I did. How did you feel about that after you did that? Did your mother listen? I she she she did. She didn't tell me off for that, but you're right. I don't normally swear. No. I swear a lot. I swear far too much. You swear too much. Yeah. I don't normally swear, but that that issue did wind me up. Yeah. The the only other thing I swear about is we have a mutual a friend that you keep raising. And whenever you mention him, I tend to swear. But otherwise otherwise, I I don't swear. Do you want do you want to add the person? No. No. No. Thanks very much. No. Thanks very much. I'll tell it, though. Thanks. K. You're you're very discreet. You're very good at keeping my relationships alive by not passing on horrible, malicious gossip to stir up Empathy between I actually hate malicious gossip. I really do. Well, could you please not contact our mutual friend and tell him that I swear whenever it's a extension? I thought you meant the her. Right, Gun. Here's a question for you. Junior doctor strikes. Ben Evans, I was wondering to hear more of your thoughts from the junior doctor strikes. I feel like both the conservatives and labor are really underestimating that goodwill has almost run out, And the solidarity among doctors has never been stronger. The point here being that Keir Sama and the Labour government, understandably, because they're worried about how they're gonna balance Budget Yep. Are not saying that they're gonna offer the pay rises that the junior doctors are asking for. So the junior doctors are angry with both conservatives and labor. Do you think that both Conservatives and Labour are are underestimating that goodwill has run out? And do you think Labour's making a mistake? I think, Well, I think on Labor, I saw West Streeting did a very, very good interview where I think it was with Sky News. And Sky were trying to get him essentially to say, well, That's all very well, but how would you pay for this? How would you pay for that? And Wes' line was, look. I'm very, very happy to tell you how we will fund the promises that we are currently making. What I'm not going to do is tell you how the government should be funding what they are promising when they know they can't fund it. But, Ben Evans, I'm a junior doctor. No. No. I get that. Yeah. Now we're going to this next question. I feel the press recently has been very anti doctor, especially Wes Streeting, Who among doctors sounds like he has no idea what he's talking about, e g self referring to specialist, is the worst health policy I've heard in years. I've been a proud Labour supporter all my life, but in the next election, I think I will have to change things. So there's you saying positive stuff. Otherwise, this doctor risks. Okay. You're right. No. And and I do think that I I've got friends who are doctors, both junior doctors and consultants, and I think there was a real oh, hold on a minute with that off referral things. I think it's such a complicated idea, and I wonder whether that will survive the test of of of time. What I do think about junior doctors, I think the phrase junior doctors is so weird because it you think of a junior, you think of somebody who's young. You think of somebody who's, like, you know, very low down the pecking order. Junior doctors are the people that we in the main rely on when we're going to hospital, and their people are incredibly well trained, not very well paid. I've had contact from junior doctors I know, one of whom is a sister of another mutual friend, by the way, who have Say that what they feel really angry and frustrated about, and they actually think the BMA has played into this, is that their the whole issue is being made about pay. Whereas what they say, the reason they are protesting is because they feel currently unable to deliver safe, basic, decent health care. Now that completely charms of what Labour are saying. Now I get why Labour don't want to say we're gonna fund this, this, and this. I get that. But I do think on the politics of this, The public, I think, are they were certainly behind the nurses. I think it's very interesting how the media are barely covering the junior doctors' strikes and protests. That march was extraordinary. It was a huge, huge thing. I mean, very rare that you see a march as big as that in London during on a weekday in particular, and yet barely got any coverage. So I think that that's where the public are. They want these people to get a fair deal. So I hope that Labour will sort of maybe push this self referral thing to one side, and that might make Ben Evans come back to Labour. But I do think on the politics of this, what the Labour are trying to do is to get caught in the same slipstream. And that question says to me that they're not necessarily doing the right thing on it. We may maybe that you're you've sensed that the public actually want higher taxes and higher spending. Which which Labour don't want to promise. Well, they want the higher spending, but they don't necessarily want to talk about higher taxes. Or the other thing I think that's happened recently, which relates to this, we've had a few questions about about about childcare. Lorraine Pengilli, massively expensive in the UK, holding women back. Want to know your thoughts on what the government could do to help and childcare costs. So the government announced something in the budget. And now it's quite a quite a big thing. Quite a big package for very small children. Yet again with this government, not clear how it's gonna work, etcetera, etcetera. But I think that the reason they did that was because labor, particularly through Bridget Phillips and the education secretary, has made clear that childcare is going to be a huge part of the labor program. So the government sense is trying to say, well, We're doing it 1st. I think Labour held back on the detail. That was a trick that you always did when you were in Labour government. Every time the Tories and opposition came up with a policy, It's one of the great things governments can do. You you nick a policy that's good. You implement it straight away. Policies that we have for the conservatives. What what policies do we need? Certainly, from the point of view of the conservatives, they felt and that the oppositions always feel that. Yeah. You hold back. You hold back. If the opposition produces a bad idea. The government shoots it down. If the opposition produces a good idea, the government simply adopts it wholesale. And the government stand and then the left, and the opposition stands there saying, well, it was our idea first, nobody cares. Yeah. Totally get that. So that's, I think this goes back to our continuing discussion about the Ming Vaz strategy or the Big Bold strategy. Part of them in bars is to say, well, we we are going to do something big in this area, but we're not going to say what it is until we get very close to the election. But but the government has sensed quite rightly that and we've talked a lot about this, many, many questions on childcare. It is an incredible burden on people's lives. And the government has now announced that up to, I think, a £100,000, children over 1, when this policy is implemented, will then get 30 hours of free childcare a week, which make a huge difference to people. But the problem, of course, when you read the small print, is that I think it's I'm I hope I'm getting this right. It's children, I think, who are born after December of this year. So one of the tricks in a lot of these budgets from all these governments is to Push things forward, change their fiscal rules, push things into the future. But I definitely think it's a policy that will be hugely popular and very, very welcome. But I think that if childcare becomes one of the defining big debates at the election, I think that will end up being to Labour's advantage, I suspect. Here's a good one for you, Rory, which you can answer better than I can, although I do know the answer. Why do MPs stand up in dire? I've always wondered why between an MP asking a question, the prime minister being called to answer, Other MPs stand up. They seem to be asking for a chance to respond to the question, but, of course, it will only be the prime minister who gets to answer. So why did they do it? So in order to get to speak in the House of Commons, the speak the speakers are. Exactly. The speakers got to call you. And the speakers only prepare to call you if you're on your feet, which means that you bob up and down endlessly. So every time anyone else stands, you have to stand. Yes. Yes. And and in a long in a long debate, when I was trying to get called, So, I mean, I got so infuriated by this stuff. I was one of the only MPs who'd spent serious time in Syria, And I was trying to get called in the Syria debate. And I was there for 3 hours, and I'd written a really Strong 10 minute speech on speaker. To watch Peter Bone being called. And I would stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, And John Burke never called me. And at the end of 3 hours, I went up to him and I said, John, I am basically the only person in this chamber who spent serious time in Syria. I'm a member of the foreign affairs select committee. Why did you not go? Well, well, Rory, you know, sometimes, you know, customers it's Completely infuriating. And the other thing they do Can I let you in a little secret, by the way? Yeah. Go on. You know our motto? It's Don't agree agree. Yeah. Do Do you know who I got that Oh, no, please. Oh, no. Please. John BOGO. Alex Salmond. It's John BOGO. I I was talking to him, and I I he said we'd watch the art of disagreeing agreeably. And I thought, what a great line. Is that a terrible thing to say? Dom, my producer, has got his head in his hands. Oh, Deary me. Deary me. So thanks, John. Anyway, carry on, Aurelia. So the and and the other thing that they do, which I don't know whether the Public watching understands is that as the debate goes on, the speaker keeps reducing the amount of time you get to speak. So on biggest use that I really cared about, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, that I put huge energy into. I went to Libya the day after Gaddafi fell. You're popping up and down. It starts unlimited, then it becomes a 10 minute limit, then a 9 minute limit. By the time they call me, it's A 3 minute limit. Right. Well, you've had a lawyer in love with this call. You're all good. And as you can and and you can and when you say that when you say to that, Say to your colleagues, I cannot or maybe it's a The honorable gentleman will sit down. I cannot, you know, within 4 minutes, To make all the points that need to be made about what's going on in Libya. When I've just come back from visit to Libya, everyone said, no. No. No. No. Any member of parliament worth their salt should be able to make their points in 4 minutes. And one of the objections I had to the European Parliament is they had a 90 second limit on speeches. The idea that you can send Sirius in 90 seconds. You can see if you can do it with a tweet, Roy. Right. We've got loads of questions to try and get through this week, Roy, so let's have a quick break. I'm Josh Klein. And I'm Elise Hu. We host a podcast from Accenture called Built for Change.

I would like to know what each of you likes and dislikes about the other. Let's go on the dislikes. The dynamic between you both is what makes the rest of his politics such a success, and I love it. So start with you, Roy. What do you not like about Alastair? Okay. So I I'm sure you're asked this the whole time. No. So the the thing that winds me up most about Alastair Campbell is the fact that the only conservative MPs he seems to like are real horrors like Alan Clark. Paradoxically, you're only comfortable with conservative you never talk about people I really admire like David Gawk. You I like David Gort. You you like I got David Gort to go and speak at the People's World Rally. The people you talk was very nice, but people brought his dad, and I liked his dad. You talk about are the rogues. You only like Conservative MPs, when they're rogues like Alan Clark trying to hand over their Rolls Royces to you, that's my complaint about you. Okay. Okay. What do I not like about Rory? I really it's not a not like. I find it disturbing that he knows literally nothing about sport. I find that really disturbing, and it makes me feel sorry for him. And I don't like to feel sympathetic to somebody that I'm meant to be meant to be sparring with. And I think the other thing, you're going about, So I think Can I just come down there? I mean, the I sort of feel that the hours that you spend watching sport how many hours a week do you spend watching sport? What's 24 times 7? No. It's not, mate. It's the time when I can be, you know, reading books I do both. Developing knowledge. Rather so. It's only how not many hours from the day. Right? I mean Yeah. Okay. You've probably spent now, I would think, in your life, one and a half solid years of your entire life watching sport. Yeah. But, you know, we spent almost a third of our lives sleeping. So, you know, so no. I'd say I'd say something. I think, Look. You're a very decent blow for a Tory. Okay? No doubt about that. So that that blows your theory about me completely in a hole. I wouldn't be doing this podcast with you, Though you're a Tory, if I didn't think there was some sort of decency there. But you'd really prefer to be doing it with Alan Clark, wouldn't you? Well, but I'd rather he was alive than dead because I thought he added a lot of gayness to the nation. But I think you are I've noticed, for example, that the 2 people you most despise Yeah. I think. Yeah. 1 is Johnson. Yeah. And and I think the other said he can't. And let me finish. And I think what they have in common is that you wanted the job that they didn't want him to get. So I think there's more of a Let let let let it steely determination and that killer instinct to do. Let let let let let you You're like you remind me of my Fiona, right, In this regard, right, when we go about out and about, people see me and Fiona together, and I'm like the big bastard, and she's just the saint. Right? And I think with you people that, you know, Alastair Cobb is this horrible, hard bastard, and Rory's the nice guy. And I don't think you're as nice as you may or have on that. Can I just put on the record? I think Sadiq Khan is a much better person than Boris Johnson. Okay. Just click there. Put there. Don't say but. Very good. Okay. Okay. Here's a question for you. Jacques Malleable Mhmm. What tip did you receive as a young journalist that you still think is relevant and important? How would you say that in French? Yes? Yes. When As a young journalist that you Jean Generaliste. That you still think is relevant and important. Relevant. Yeah. I think. Was that okay? Very good. Yes. Why was he in French? Is he is that is he called Jacques? You think he's French? Jacques Malabre. Jacques Malabre. He could be from Wigan. I mean, It's only 8 the north of England. What tip did you receive that you think is no longer applicable in a much changed media landscape? No. I'll tell you the tip that I received from my very good friend and mentor, Sid Young, sadly no longer with us. And I remember him once saying to me, and I I absolutely there's a story in everybody. Okay. So that Ruby do you mean? That's still relevant. And what tip, he says his second question, do you think is no longer applicable in a much changed media landscape? I I was going to say, I wonder whether you really need a 150 minute shorthand given that funny of these students I was with yesterday Do you have a 150 minute shorthand? I don't now. But, yeah, I still do shorthand, but I don't have a. But I've noticed all these students yesterday, none of them were taking notes. They're just tapping on the on a keyboard. So maybe that maybe that. I still think shorthand's useful to have, but I don't think it's as important as it was. You couldn't qualify as a journalist without shorthand back in the day. Yeah. Right. I've got one for you. I'll go over it. I I have one for you. Guy Elliott, UK soft power. Just over a week ago, Incidentally, we both agreed with every word of what I'm about to read, but I'm gonna give you an opportunity to respond. Do you agree with it? The UK's only full time professional choir, the BBC Singers, Was acts suddenly after nearly a 100 years of extraordinary service? This has prompted calls from music fans and professionals to propose a boycott of the BBC Proms. In the last year, we've seen huge cuts to the English Natural Opera, Glyndebourne tour, the Britain Sinfonia, WNO, and many other vital musical and art institutions. What can be done to stop this wanton destruction of our rich cultural landscape and heritage? How do we protect and promote the UK's position as a global leader in culture when the current government Seems to be ideologically opposed to a diverse, high quality music and arts scene, and that is going, and the rest is politics manifested to challenge the Labour government to reinstate when they come in. Funny enough, particularly at a time when everything else feels so s h I t, that there's always a danger that arts and culture gets hit first when, actually, arts and culture are fundamental to all the things that make life special. I thought the one of the my favorite of many really moving bits of the the leading interview with Rahim Al Mahmoud from the stop the Uighur genocide campaign was when she said that she's she's a musician. She's a very talented musician. She said that she saw her music as an act of defiance against the regime because they're trying to erase their culture and erase all joy. And I'll tell you how crazy this. Louise Shackleton, who's David Miliband's wife, and she's a she's a musician. She's a violinist. And she's she's been sending me stuff all week, which she's so wound up about this. And she says to this, what on earth is happening with the BBC? The BBC had a headline, Dorset Farmer to Conduct Music at King's Coronation. This toxic farmer happens to be sir John Elliott Gardner, who's one of the greatest conductors there has there has ever been. And then there's an American American composer by, John Adams, American composer and conductor. He has come out and said, I just do not understand This is happening in Britain. I mean, that that is unbelievable, isn't it? So listen. We are I've been tweeting away madly for the BBC singers. And, of course, when you do, you get all these Lee Anderson types saying, oh, Metropolitan elite love you singing, all the rest of it. They want to portray all this art stuff as only being for kind of, you know, wealthy elite. Like, you know, kids in working class areas don't like to, you know, do arts and culture. So I'm with you on this one, and I really do think, Look. It's such an easy thing for Labour just to say. You know? Obviously, it's not their budget. Yeah. It's the BBC. Yeah. But for the if Labour started a campaign now for the BBC Singers, I think they'd win it. I do think the John Elliott Gardner thing is absolutely insane. What? Dorset Farmer? Completely insane. So this guy, for listeners because we we'll we'll put a clip onto, I don't know, English baroque called Monteverdi, but this man is an international superstar of music. Yeah. And and the one thing he's not There's nothing wrong with Dorsett Farm Supply. He's known around the world for us is agricultural practices. So there we are. I listen. If the BBC wanna come back and say that was a fake tweet or the spoof or whatever, fair enough, but It was pretty ridiculous. Right. Max Ferreira. I've recently been watching the Simpsons, and I came across the episode that Tony Blair featured in. I was shocked that Tony Blair actually voiced himself on the show. Could I ask Alastair how that arrangement came to happen, and what part did you play? Yeah. Go on then. Tell us about that. Would you like to be the Simpsons? Would you would you Yeah. Yeah. I would quite like to. Weirdly, the president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, was exactly identical to Homer Simpson's boss. It's really, really weird. Anyway, yes. Can you tell us about Tony Blair? Why that's this question leaked out leaped out to me is because I I do remember it. I can't remember how it got arranged. The Simpsons basically just asked if Tony Blair would be in it, and I don't think I've ever seen him quite as excited as he was. But now I think Tony's 3 most Culturally exciting moments. There was recording the Simpsons and then being on the Simpsons. He liked that. Meeting Barbara Streisand. He was genuinely a bit starstruck with Barbara advisement. And and the other one, you met David Bowie at the Brits. And that was a big deal. That was a big deal. He he felt and I remember we got in the car on the road map. Would he Are you would you be more excited about meeting David Bowie or Mick Jagger? Well, I met Mick Jagger. I see. And I met David Bowie. Which was more exciting for you? I think I I think David Bowie I think David Bowie is a bigger historical I don't know. I think they're both really impressive, aren't they? Pretty impressive. I don't think I think when you get to that level then there was the other time was Tony was hosting a meeting of regional political editors in the cabinet room, and there was a knock on the door and Fiona, my Fiona, who was with 3 at the time, Said, is this important? And I sort of not really. Regional journalist. So she said, we've got a guest, and, Sheree brought Paul McCartney in. So that was quite cool. That was pretty cool. Now here's an interesting question from Colin Moody. Another podcast I listened to recently suggested that Tony Blair considered sending the SAS into Zimbabwe to take out Mugabe. How much, if any, truth is there in us? And and I want to, just on that, talk a little bit about somebody that we both knew quite well, Charles Guthrie. Yep. It's chief of defense staff. So he was my neighbor when I was growing up in London. Okay. Live 2 doors down. I used to play with his sons. And I I knew him, I guess, when he was first a young colonel And very sadly lost his his wife recently. And he, I think, is sometimes remembered as having got into conversations with you and Tony Blair about the feasibility intervening in Zimbabwe. Talk a little bit about that. Is that something that you've been open about? I don't remember the specifics of Zimbabwe and Mugabe. I don't think we would have done an assassination on Mugabe. The story at the time, though, is that, almost, actually, in the lead up to the Iraq war, There was huge anxiety about what was happening in the Gharib. And remember, Gharib, again, for listeners, taken over. And in 1983, had led this Horrifying massacre of his political opponents called the Gorakhundi. He had then presided over rising inflation, expropriation of farms, and And there was increasing pressure, wasn't there, on the Blair government to do something through the late seventies, early 2000s? Yeah. And, And Charles Guthrie, by the way, was definitely part of that discussion that led to the intervention that we did in in, Sierra Leone. I remember him specifically coming over and explaining why you thought this was so important. And as you were saying in the discussion about Iraq, you know, the military have their own views. They won't do anything without political Yep. You know, oversight. But I have no memory at all of a discussion about taking out Mugabe. I will say about Charles Guthrie, and I'm a you said on the Iraq podcast thought I was a bit too sort of respectful and deferential to these military bods and what have you. But I found him an absolutely fascinating character. As you know, I've got this thing about people who wear their The pinky rings. Pinky rings, but I didn't mind Charles's pinky rings. You don't mind that? Okay. And one of my proudest moments was when I I was over at the MOD, and he introduced me to some I think it was an American guy who was wandering around the place, and Charles said, this is this is Arash Arash Der Campbell. He's the Eshayesh of spin. Very good. Which I was, you know, very good. That's a good good compliment from China. Here's one for you. Yep. Pakistan. Edmund Rose. Mhmm. I think I know what you're going to answer this as well. Is Imran Khan pluckily fighting a government which intent on staying in power and therefore trying to prevent him from campaigning and being elected, or is he a populist who is no better for his country well in power than the various other recent Pakistan prime ministers? Well, Imran Khan is definitely whatever you think about it. I mean, you know, somebody who was very, very well known in Britain, probably the most famous Pakistani, leader, I think, has ever been in Britain because he was an incredibly famous cricket star, married to Jemima Khan, Jamal Goldsmith, he undoubtedly has a lot of populist tendencies in the way he does politics. He's created a Whole change in Pakistani political culture. I used to go campaigning with Pakistani politicians in the early 2000. I remember driving around with one of the members of this Pakistani elite family. So she was campaigning in rural Punjab, and she would we drove in the back of a car. The car would drive up to some men sitting on a string bed outside a collection of mud houses. The driver would put down the window, and he would say, In the back of this car is lady so and so, the daughter of mister so and so and the daughter of lady so and so. Will you vote for in the next election? And the men, it's a very feudal system, would basically stand off their string beds, Pull their forelock and say, and then the car would drive on, and that was political campaigning. So in those days, Pakistani politics was dominated by these feudal landlords who often went back to the British Raj, who were descended from famous saints from the middle ages. And what's happened is Imran Khan has created a whole new coalition based on new urban money and youth. He was brought in with the backing of the military, tried to fight against the military. The military essentially threw him out. And there is absolutely no doubt, really, that if an election was held today, he seems to have an overwhelming support, which would bring him in again. But the current government, which is being run by the brother of the the the previous prime minister, is technocratic, Focused on detail, efficient, and there is a culture war going on. Very classic culture war between somebody who's a sort of, Rishi Sunak figure, you know, very thoughtful, serious, technocratic detail against Imran Khan who absolutely represents Public opinion and can deploy huge crowds into the streets. And in the middle of all this is the Pakistan military that still effectively runs Pakistan. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's take this one. The the this both the main podcast and the q and a have been quite gloomy. Let's try and inject a bit of hope. Alex Mee, is there anything about the current political situation that gives you hope? Should I dare to feel hopeful about the future, or are we just on the giant island shaped Titanic slowly sinking further and further. Okay. Let me try first to get back to you. Thing that gives me hope is that we often talk about an age of populism, but actually there have been Very positive developments. We've talked about the fact that Biden defeated Trump, did well again in the midterms. We've talked about successes in Slovenia and Czech Republic, People fighting against populists, the teal independents in Australia. Bolsonaro gone. Bolsonaro gone. Boris Johnson gone. Liz Truss gone. So I think populism is still a very, very powerful force in a world of social media, but it isn't always gonna win. And perhaps the most optimistic of all is Macron Defeating Le Pen. Back to you. I do get hopeful when I do events like I did with the King's College guys yesterday who were Engaged. Interesting. Okay. They're political students, but I think there are a lot of people who are really interested in politics at the moment, but just worried about it. At Manchester City against Burnley on Saturday. I went with my son, Calum, and would get arrive on your way, and and the guy next to me was, You talk about this this match a lot. Was it What was because we played so well? It's the heat so well. We played so well. Oh, yeah. He's very, very good. You know? We as everybody said is I think Pep Guardiola said, and he's after much interview, you know, they were lucky to to get 6 nil. But so and the 1st guy who came sat next to me was a guy called Mark, who I'd never met before. We got chatting about this, that, and the other, and eventually started talking a little bit about politics. And he said, like, don't be cross with me, but I've actually he was in his Forties, I'd say. This is Don't We Cross remover. I've never ever voted in my life. I've just never bothered, but I'm gonna vote this time because we've gotta get rid of these people. That gave me hope. Put it this way. If this government does hang on for another term, I really would feel hopeless about the future. You get you get depressed. Yeah. You'd you'd you'd move off to France or something. And I do honestly, I'm sure you get the same. I think it's hopeful that we've You know, I know you've seen it when you just back in London the last couple of days. The number of people who have come up to say really like your podcast, I think that is hopeful, because I think it says that people are engaged, want to be engaged, but don't quite know how to be engaged, which is why Alastair Campbell's book, But What Can I Do? May 11th, Penguin Random House is so timely, Rory. Yep. So Alastair Campbell's book, May 11th, Penguin Random House. You heard about it first here. Right. Thank you all very much.",

And with picture proof of delivery, everyone could focus on the perfect opening night. FedEx, Where now meets next for residential delivery only.\n\nSpeaker 3: I'm Josh Klein.\n\nSpeaker 2: And I'm Elise Hu.\n\nSpeaker 3: We host a podcast from Accenture called Built For Change.\n\nSpeaker 2: Every part of every business is being reinvented right now. That means companies are facing brand new pressures to use fast technologies and address shifting consumer expectations.\n\nSpeaker 3: But with big changes come even bigger opportunities.

And I want to start, Rory, with a question that shows the unbelievable prescience of some of our listeners. This is a question that we got last October, 3rd October, from somebody called George Rose. How scared should we be about current Credit Suisse CDS levels? Did the global financial systems learn anything from 2008?\n\nSpeaker 4: Well, I mean Why did we not answer that\n\nSpeaker 0: at the time?\n\nSpeaker 4: Exactly. So firstly for listeners, CDS's credit default swaps, And that is what 6 days ago really began the collapse of Credit Suisse, but, obviously, George Rose was onto it in October.\n\nSpeaker 0: And is this related to the Silicon Valley Bank problems? Is this a domino thing going on?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Absolutely. Basically, People were so panicked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank that they began looking around for other banks to be panicked by, and people began withdrawing money from one of the weaker of the major banks of the world, which is Credit Suisse, and essentially started a bank run. And the result was the Saudi, state fund refused to keep funding them. And in the end, the other great Swiss bank, UBS, has had to step in and buy out Credit Suisse, and they've bought it For a fraction of its theoretical book value.\n\nI mean, they've bought it for a few 1,000,000,000.\n\nSpeaker 0: So does that mean if you have money now with Credit Suisse, that your money is now worth less or not.\n\nSpeaker 4: If you had certain kinds of instruments, more fancy instruments, not a normal depositor. A normal depositor should be insured by the Swiss Central Bank. But, yes, people with fancy instruments may be in real trouble. And this is about people buying, high risk, High return instruments, but assuming that they're safe, finding out that they're not safe.\n\nSpeaker 0: And is and part of the reason, as I understand it with the Silicon Valley Bank, Is that you and I might have our money in a bank, and we think that's where the money stays. But in fact, that bank we're putting into other banks that may be less reliable.\n\nSpeaker 4: Whole whole series of things. You're completely right. So there's the issue of the credit default swap, which is a mechanism where a bank tries to insure itself by getting another type of instrument, which insures itself against credit default, insures itself against Losing money on optical instrument. And these things get more and more complicated, and this was one of the problems in the 2008 financial crisis. But in this particular case, Part of the problem is the way that we've regulated since 2008 and, in particular, pushing people to put more and more pushing banks put more and more of their money into government bonds.\n\nAnd the reason why they did that is that government bonds hold their value. So in 10 years' time, you can cash in your government bond, and the US treasury is not gonna default on the government bond. But in the short term, if you are forced to sell Because there's been a bank run, your government bond, you can be selling it for much less than it's worth. And this has also been affected by the fact that as Interest rates have gone up. The value of the bonds have gone down.\n\nThis is a weird mechanism. It's not that weird. But, effectively, the price of the bonds It's inversely related to the rising interest rates. So two things, the way in which these banks were regulated after 2008, and the second thing, which is the rise in interest rates, has created this real weakness at the heart of the system. And banks that were less well managed, Silicon Valley Bank seems to be one example, But Credit Suisse, even more dramatically, they've been through 3 CEOs in 3 years.\n\nThey've had a series of catastrophic scandals. They've lost a lot of money. So, clearly, George Rose, who asked that question, was one of the people who, by October last year, was already\n\nSpeaker 0: At his point, have they learned anything from 2008? What you're saying was just no.\n\nSpeaker 4: Well, unfortunately, the regulators would say they learned something from 2008, but what they did then created a whole series of different types of problem. But, yes, George is right that one of the problems is the complexity of these things. And I was talking to a banker yesterday about the balance sheet of Credit Suisse. And he said, one thing that nobody ever explains to you is that these banks are so big, So complicated that nobody understands them. Literally nobody.\n\nYou can read the balance sheet of these banks, and it makes zero sense. Because at one point, Credit Suisse had over $1,000,000,000,000 of assets under management, and they are every type of And it doesn't matter how big your brain is or almost how big your computer system is. Nobody has any idea whether Credit Suisse It's worth minus a 100,000,000,000 or whether it's worth plus 100,000,000,000.\n\nSpeaker 0: And Presumably the same we could say the same for a lot of the banks that are not currently in a mess.\n\nSpeaker 4: 100% because they they are so long as nobody's withdrawing their assets Yeah. There's not a bank run happening.\n\nSpeaker 0: Nobody semblance of security. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4: Nobody needs to really get into the question of what these things are actually worth. But, yes, again, we are being forced to confront The potential unraveling of our financial system.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bernie Bernie Sanders is right. It's okay to be angry about capitalism.\n\nSpeaker 4: And it's gonna get, I think, even worse because Since 2008, more and more and more of what's happening in these banks is, of course, automated, done by incredibly complicated computer systems now reinforced by AI algorithms so that almost nobody has any idea what's actually happening within these mechanisms. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. My favorite question to me, Rory, Andrew Hoffman. Rory is the only person I know who says things like goodness and mercy me. Does he ever swear? You swore on the Iraq podcast.\n\nSpeaker 4: I did.\n\nSpeaker 0: I did. How did you feel about that after you did that? Did your mother listen?\n\nSpeaker 4: I she she she did. She didn't tell me off for that, but you're right. I don't normally swear.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I swear a lot. I swear far too much.\n\nSpeaker 4: You swear too much. Yeah. I don't normally swear, but that that issue did wind me up. Yeah. The the only other thing I swear about is we have a mutual a friend that you keep raising.\n\nAnd whenever you mention him, I tend to swear. But otherwise otherwise, I I don't swear.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you want do you want to add the person? No.\n\nSpeaker 4: No. No. Thanks very much. No. Thanks very much.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll tell it, though.\n\nSpeaker 4: Thanks. K. You're you're very discreet. You're very good at keeping my relationships alive by not passing on horrible, malicious gossip to stir up Empathy between I\n\nSpeaker 0: actually hate malicious gossip. I really do.\n\nSpeaker 4: Well, could you please not contact our mutual friend and tell him that I swear whenever it's a extension?\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought you meant the her.\n\nSpeaker 4: Right, Gun. Here's a question for you. Junior doctor strikes. Ben Evans, I was wondering to hear more of your thoughts from the junior doctor strikes. I feel like both the conservatives and labor are really underestimating that goodwill has almost run out, And the solidarity among doctors has never been stronger.\n\nThe point here being that Keir Sama and the Labour government, understandably, because they're worried about how they're gonna balance Budget Yep. Are not saying that they're gonna offer the pay rises that the junior doctors are asking for. So the junior doctors are angry with both conservatives and labor. Do you think that both Conservatives and Labour are are underestimating that goodwill has run out? And do you think Labour's making a mistake?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think, Well, I think on Labor, I saw West Streeting did a very, very good interview where I think it was with Sky News. And Sky were trying to get him essentially to say, well, That's all very well, but how would you pay for this? How would you pay for that? And Wes' line was, look. I'm very, very happy to tell you how we will fund the promises that we are currently making.\n\nWhat I'm not going to do is tell you how the government should be funding what they are promising when they know they can't fund it.\n\nSpeaker 4: But, Ben Evans, I'm a junior doctor.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. I get that.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Now we're going to this next question. I feel the press recently has been very anti doctor, especially Wes Streeting, Who among doctors sounds like he has no idea what he's talking about, e g self referring to specialist, is the worst health policy I've heard in years. I've been a proud Labour supporter all my life, but in the next election, I think I will have to change things. So there's you saying positive stuff.\n\nOtherwise, this doctor risks.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. You're right. No. And and I do think that I I've got friends who are doctors, both junior doctors and consultants, and I think there was a real oh, hold on a minute with that off referral things. I think it's such a complicated idea, and I wonder whether that will survive the test of of of time.\n\nWhat I do think about junior doctors, I think the phrase junior doctors is so weird because it you think of a junior, you think of somebody who's young. You think of somebody who's, like, you know, very low down the pecking order. Junior doctors are the people that we in the main rely on when we're going to hospital, and their people are incredibly well trained, not very well paid. I've had contact from junior doctors I know, one of whom is a sister of another mutual friend, by the way, who have Say that what they feel really angry and frustrated about, and they actually think the BMA has played into this, is that their the whole issue is being made about pay. Whereas what they say, the reason they are protesting is because they feel currently unable to deliver safe, basic, decent health care.\n\nNow that completely charms of what Labour are saying. Now I get why Labour don't want to say we're gonna fund this, this, and this. I get that. But I do think on the politics of this, The public, I think, are they were certainly behind the nurses. I think it's very interesting how the media are barely covering the junior doctors' strikes and protests.\n\nThat march was extraordinary. It was a huge, huge thing. I mean, very rare that you see a march as big as that in London during on a weekday in particular, and yet barely got any coverage. So I think that that's where the public are. They want these people to get a fair deal.\n\nSo I hope that Labour will sort of maybe push this self referral thing to one side, and that might make Ben Evans come back to Labour. But I do think on the politics of this, what the Labour are trying to do is to get caught in the same slipstream. And that question says to me that they're not necessarily doing the right thing on it.\n\nSpeaker 4: We may maybe that you're you've sensed that the public actually want higher taxes and higher spending.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which which Labour don't want to promise. Well, they want the higher spending, but they don't necessarily want to talk about higher taxes. Or the other thing I think that's happened recently, which relates to this, we've had a few questions about about about childcare. Lorraine Pengilli, massively expensive in the UK, holding women back. Want to know your thoughts on what the government could do to help and childcare costs.\n\nSo the government announced something in the budget.\n\nSpeaker 4: And now it's quite a quite a big thing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Quite a big package for very small children. Yet again with this government, not clear how it's gonna work, etcetera, etcetera. But I think that the reason they did that was because labor, particularly through Bridget Phillips and the education secretary, has made clear that childcare is going to be a huge part of the labor program. So the government sense is trying to say, well, We're doing it 1st. I think Labour held back on the detail.\n\nSpeaker 4: That was a trick that you always did when you were in Labour government. Every time the Tories and opposition came up with a policy, It's one of the great things governments can do. You you nick a policy that's good. You implement it straight away.\n\nSpeaker 0: Policies that we have for the conservatives. What what policies do we need?\n\nSpeaker 4: Certainly, from the point of view of the conservatives, they felt and that the oppositions always feel that.\n\nSpeaker 5: Yeah. You hold back. You hold back.\n\nSpeaker 4: If the opposition produces a bad idea. The government shoots it down. If the opposition produces a good idea, the government simply adopts it wholesale. And the\n\nSpeaker 0: government stand and then the left, and the opposition stands there saying, well, it was\n\nSpeaker 5: our idea first, nobody cares.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Totally get that. So that's, I think this goes back to our continuing discussion about the Ming Vaz strategy or the Big Bold strategy. Part of them in bars is to say, well, we we are going to do something big in this area, but we're not going to say what it is until we get very close to the election.\n\nSpeaker 4: But but the government has sensed quite rightly that and we've talked a lot about this, many, many questions on childcare. It is an incredible burden on people's lives. And the government has now announced that up to, I think, a £100,000, children over 1, when this policy is implemented, will then get 30 hours of free childcare a week, which make a huge difference to people. But the problem, of course, when you read the small print, is that I think it's I'm I hope I'm getting this right. It's children, I think, who are born after December of this year.\n\nSo one of the tricks in a lot of these budgets from all these governments is to Push things forward, change their fiscal rules, push things into the future. But I definitely think it's a policy that will be hugely popular and very, very welcome.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I think that if childcare becomes one of the defining big debates at the election, I think that will end up being to Labour's advantage, I suspect. Here's a good one for you, Rory, which you can answer better than I can, although I do know the answer. Why do MPs stand up in dire? I've always wondered why between an MP asking a question, the prime minister being called to answer, Other MPs stand up. They seem to be asking for a chance to respond to the question, but, of course, it will only be the prime minister who gets to answer.\n\nSo why did they do it?\n\nSpeaker 4: So in order to get to speak in the House of Commons, the speak the\n\nSpeaker 0: speakers are.\n\nSpeaker 4: Exactly. The speakers got to call you. And the speakers only prepare to call you if you're on your feet, which means that you bob up and down endlessly. So every time anyone else stands, you have to stand. Yes.\n\nYes. And and in a long in a long debate, when I was trying to get called, So, I mean, I got so infuriated by this stuff. I was one of the only MPs who'd spent serious time in Syria, And I was trying to get called in the Syria debate. And I was there for 3 hours, and I'd written a really Strong 10 minute speech on speaker.\n\nSpeaker 0: To watch Peter Bone being called.\n\nSpeaker 4: And I would stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, stand up and sit down, And John Burke never called me. And at the end of 3 hours, I went up to him and I said, John, I am basically the only person in this chamber who spent serious time in Syria. I'm a member of the foreign affairs select committee. Why did you not go? Well, well, Rory, you know, sometimes, you know, customers it's Completely infuriating.\n\nAnd the other thing they do Can\n\nSpeaker 0: I let you in a little secret, by the way?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Go on.\n\nSpeaker 0: You know our motto? It's Don't agree agree. Yeah. Do Do you know who I got that\n\nSpeaker 4: Oh, no, please. Oh, no. Please. John BOGO. Alex Salmond.\n\nSpeaker 5: It's John BOGO. I I was talking to him, and I I he said we'd watch the art of disagreeing agreeably. And I thought, what a great\n\nSpeaker 0: line. Is that a terrible thing to say? Dom, my producer, has got\n\nSpeaker 5: his head in his hands.\n\nSpeaker 4: Oh, Deary me. Deary me.\n\nSpeaker 0: So thanks, John. Anyway, carry on, Aurelia.\n\nSpeaker 4: So the and and the other thing that they do, which I don't know whether the Public watching understands is that as the debate goes on, the speaker keeps reducing the amount of time you get to speak. So on biggest use that I really cared about, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, that I put huge energy into. I went to Libya the day after Gaddafi fell. You're popping up and down. It starts unlimited, then it becomes a 10 minute limit, then a 9 minute limit.\n\nBy the time they call me, it's A 3 minute limit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Well, you've had a lawyer in love with this call. You're all good.\n\nSpeaker 4: And as you can\n\nSpeaker 0: and and you can and\n\nSpeaker 4: when you say that when you say to that, Say to your colleagues, I cannot or maybe it's a\n\nSpeaker 0: The honorable gentleman will sit down.\n\nSpeaker 4: I cannot, you know, within 4 minutes, To make all the points that need to be made about what's going on in Libya. When I've just come back from visit to Libya, everyone said, no. No. No. No.\n\nAny member of parliament worth their salt should be able to make their points in 4 minutes.

I would like to know what each of you likes and dislikes about the other. Let's go on the dislikes. The dynamic between you both is what makes the rest of his politics such a success, and I love it.\n\nSo start with you, Roy. What do you not like about Alastair?\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So I I'm\n\nSpeaker 0: sure you're asked this the whole time.\n\nSpeaker 4: No. So the the thing that winds me up most about Alastair Campbell is the fact that the only conservative MPs he seems to like are real horrors like Alan Clark. Paradoxically, you're only comfortable with conservative you never talk about people I really admire like David Gawk.\n\nSpeaker 0: You I like David Gort. You you like I got David Gort to go and speak at the People's World Rally. The people you talk was very nice, but people brought his dad, and I liked his dad.\n\nSpeaker 4: You talk about are the rogues. You only like Conservative MPs, when they're rogues like Alan Clark trying to hand over their Rolls Royces to you, that's my complaint about you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. What do I not like about Rory? I really it's not a not like. I find it disturbing that he knows literally nothing about sport.\n\nI find that really disturbing, and it makes me feel sorry for him. And I don't like to feel sympathetic to somebody that I'm meant to be meant to be sparring with. And I think the other thing, you're going about, So I think\n\nSpeaker 4: Can I just come down there?\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean,\n\nSpeaker 4: the I sort of feel that the hours that you spend watching sport how many hours a week do you spend watching sport?\n\nSpeaker 0: What's 24 times 7? No. It's not, mate.\n\nSpeaker 4: It's the time when I can be, you know, reading books\n\nSpeaker 5: I do both.\n\nSpeaker 4: Developing knowledge.\n\nSpeaker 0: Rather so.\n\nSpeaker 4: It's only how not many hours from the day.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right? I mean Yeah. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 4: You've probably spent now, I would think, in your life, one and a half solid years of your entire life watching sport.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But, you know, we spent almost a third of our lives sleeping. So, you know, so no. I'd say I'd say something. I think, Look.\n\nYou're a very decent blow for a Tory. Okay? No doubt about that. So that that blows your theory about me completely in a hole. I wouldn't be doing this podcast with you, Though you're a Tory, if I didn't think there was some sort of decency there.\n\nSpeaker 4: But you'd really prefer to be doing it with Alan Clark, wouldn't you?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, but I'd rather he was alive than dead because I thought he added a lot of gayness to the nation. But I think you are I've noticed, for example, that the 2 people you most despise\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think. Yeah. 1 is Johnson. Yeah. And and I think the other said he can't.\n\nAnd let me finish. And I think what they have in common is that you wanted the job that they didn't want him to get. So I think there's more of a Let let let let it steely determination and that killer instinct to do. Let let let let let you You're like you remind me of my Fiona, right, In this regard, right, when we go about out and about, people see me and Fiona together, and I'm like the big bastard, and she's just the saint. Right?\n\nAnd I think with you people that, you know, Alastair Cobb is this horrible, hard bastard, and Rory's the nice guy. And I don't think you're as nice as you may or have\n\nSpeaker 5: on that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Can I\n\nSpeaker 4: just put on the record? I think Sadiq Khan is a much better person than Boris Johnson. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Just click there. Put there. Don't say but. Very good. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Here's a question for you. Jacques Malleable Mhmm. What tip did you receive as a young journalist that you still think is relevant and important? How would you say that in French?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes? Yes.\n\nSpeaker 4: When As a young journalist\n\nSpeaker 0: that you Jean Generaliste.\n\nSpeaker 4: That you still think is relevant and important.\n\nSpeaker 0: Relevant. Yeah. I think. Was that okay?\n\nSpeaker 4: Very good. Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: Why was he in French? Is he is\n\nSpeaker 4: that is he called Jacques?\n\nSpeaker 0: You think he's French?\n\nSpeaker 4: Jacques Malabre.\n\nSpeaker 0: Jacques Malabre. He could be from Wigan. I mean, It's only 8 the north of England.\n\nSpeaker 4: What tip did you receive that you think is no longer applicable in a much changed media landscape?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I'll tell you the tip that I received from my very good friend and mentor, Sid Young, sadly no longer with us. And I remember him once saying to me, and I I absolutely there's a story in everybody.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So that Ruby do you mean? That's still relevant. And what tip, he says his second question, do you think is no longer applicable in a much changed media landscape?\n\nSpeaker 0: I I was going to say, I wonder whether you really need a 150 minute shorthand given that funny of these students I was with yesterday\n\nSpeaker 4: Do you have a 150 minute shorthand?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't now. But, yeah, I still do shorthand, but I don't have a. But I've noticed all these students yesterday, none of them were taking notes. They're just tapping on the on a keyboard. So maybe that maybe that.\n\nI still think shorthand's useful to have, but I don't think it's as important as it was. You couldn't qualify as a journalist without shorthand back in the day. Yeah. Right. I've got one for you.\n\nI'll go over\n\nSpeaker 4: it. I I have one for you. Guy Elliott, UK soft power. Just over a week ago, Incidentally, we both agreed with every word of what I'm about to read, but I'm gonna give you an opportunity to respond.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you\n\nSpeaker 4: agree with it? The UK's only full time professional choir, the BBC Singers, Was acts suddenly after nearly a 100 years of extraordinary service? This has prompted calls from music fans and professionals to propose a boycott of the BBC Proms. In the last year, we've seen huge cuts to the English Natural Opera, Glyndebourne tour, the Britain Sinfonia, WNO, and many other vital musical and art institutions. What can be done to stop this wanton destruction of our rich cultural landscape and heritage?\n\nHow do we protect and promote the UK's position as a global leader in culture when the current government Seems to be ideologically opposed to a diverse, high quality music and arts scene, and that is going, and the rest is politics manifested to challenge the Labour government to reinstate when they come in.\n\nSpeaker 0: Funny enough, particularly at a time when everything else feels so s h I t, that there's always a danger that arts and culture gets hit first when, actually, arts and culture are fundamental to all the things that make life special. I thought the one of the my favorite of many really moving bits of the the leading interview with Rahim Al Mahmoud from the stop the Uighur genocide campaign was when she said that she's she's a musician. She's a very talented musician. She said that she saw her music as an act of defiance against the regime because they're trying to erase their culture and erase all joy. And I'll tell you how crazy this.\n\nLouise Shackleton, who's David Miliband's wife, and she's a she's a musician. She's a violinist. And she's she's been sending me stuff all week, which she's so wound up about this. And she says to this, what on earth is happening with the BBC? The BBC had a headline, Dorset Farmer to Conduct Music at King's Coronation.\n\nThis toxic farmer happens to be sir John Elliott Gardner, who's one of the greatest conductors there has there has ever been. And then there's an American American composer by, John Adams, American composer and conductor. He has come out and said, I just do not understand This is happening in Britain.\n\nSpeaker 4: I mean, that that is unbelievable, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: So listen. We are I've been tweeting away madly for the BBC singers. And, of course, when you do, you get all these Lee Anderson types saying, oh, Metropolitan elite love you singing, all the rest of it. They want to portray all this art stuff as only being for kind of, you know, wealthy elite. Like, you know, kids in working class areas don't like to, you know, do arts and culture.\n\nSo I'm with you on this one, and I really do think, Look. It's such an easy thing for Labour just to say. You know? Obviously, it's not their budget. Yeah.\n\nIt's the BBC. Yeah. But for the if Labour started a campaign now for the BBC Singers, I think they'd win it.\n\nSpeaker 4: I do think the John Elliott Gardner thing is absolutely insane.\n\nSpeaker 0: What? Dorset Farmer?\n\nSpeaker 4: Completely insane. So this guy, for listeners because we we'll we'll put a clip onto, I don't know, English baroque called Monteverdi, but this man is an international superstar of music.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And and the\n\nSpeaker 4: one thing he's not\n\nSpeaker 0: There's nothing wrong with Dorsett Farm Supply.\n\nSpeaker 4: He's known around the world for us is agricultural practices.\n\nSpeaker 0: So there we are. I listen. If the BBC wanna come back and say that was a fake tweet or the spoof or whatever, fair enough, but It was pretty ridiculous. Right. Max Ferreira.\n\nI've recently been watching the Simpsons, and I came across the episode that Tony Blair featured in. I was shocked that Tony Blair actually voiced himself on the show. Could I ask Alastair how that arrangement came to happen, and what part did you play?\n\nSpeaker 4: Yeah. Go on then. Tell us about that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Would you like to be the Simpsons? Would you would you Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 4: I would quite like to. Weirdly, the president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, was exactly identical to Homer Simpson's boss. It's really, really weird. Anyway, yes. Can you tell us about\n\nSpeaker 0: Tony Blair? Why that's this question leaked out leaped out to me is because I I do remember it. I can't remember how it got arranged. The Simpsons basically just asked if Tony Blair would be in it, and I don't think I've ever seen him quite as excited as he was. But now I think Tony's 3 most Culturally exciting moments.\n\nThere was recording the Simpsons and then being on the Simpsons. He liked that. Meeting Barbara Streisand. He was genuinely a bit starstruck with Barbara advisement. And and the other one, you met David Bowie at the Brits.\n\nAnd\n\nSpeaker 4: that was a big deal.\n\nSpeaker 0: That was a big deal. He he felt and I remember we got in the car on the\n\nSpeaker 4: road map. Would he Are you would you be more excited about meeting David Bowie or Mick Jagger?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I met Mick Jagger.\n\nSpeaker 4: I see.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I met David Bowie.\n\nSpeaker 4: Which was more exciting for you?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think I I think David Bowie I think David Bowie is a bigger historical I don't know. I think they're both really impressive, aren't they?\n\nSpeaker 4: Pretty impressive.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't think I think when you get to that level then there was the other time was Tony was hosting a meeting of regional political editors in the cabinet room, and there was a knock on the door and Fiona, my Fiona, who was with 3 at the time, Said, is this important? And I sort of not really. Regional journalist. So she said, we've got a guest, and, Sheree brought Paul McCartney in. So that was quite cool.\n\nSpeaker 4: That was pretty cool. Now here's an interesting question from Colin Moody. Another podcast I listened to recently suggested that Tony Blair considered sending the SAS into Zimbabwe to take out Mugabe. How much, if any, truth is there in us? And and I want to, just on that, talk a little bit about somebody that we both knew quite well, Charles Guthrie.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. It's\n\nSpeaker 4: chief of defense staff. So he was my neighbor when I was growing up in London. Okay. Live 2 doors down. I used to play with his sons.\n\nAnd I I knew him, I guess, when he was first a young colonel And very sadly lost his his wife recently. And he, I think, is sometimes remembered as having got into conversations with you and Tony Blair about the feasibility intervening in Zimbabwe. Talk a little bit about that. Is that something that you've been open about?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't remember the specifics of Zimbabwe and Mugabe. I don't think we would have done an assassination on Mugabe.\n\nSpeaker 4: The story at the time, though, is that, almost, actually, in the lead up to the Iraq war, There was huge anxiety about what was happening in the Gharib. And remember, Gharib, again, for listeners, taken over. And in 1983, had led this Horrifying massacre of his political opponents called the Gorakhundi. He had then presided over rising inflation, expropriation of farms, and And there was increasing pressure, wasn't there, on the Blair government to do something through the late seventies, early 2000s?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And, And Charles Guthrie, by the way, was definitely part of that discussion that led to the intervention that we did in in, Sierra Leone. I remember him specifically coming over and explaining why you thought this was so important. And as you were saying in the discussion about Iraq, you know, the military have their own views. They won't do anything without political Yep.\n\nYou know, oversight. But I have no memory at all of a discussion about taking out Mugabe. I will say about Charles Guthrie, and I'm a you said on the Iraq podcast thought I was a bit too sort of respectful and deferential to these military bods and what have you. But I found him an absolutely fascinating character. As you know, I've got this thing about people who wear their The\n\nSpeaker 4: pinky rings.\n\nSpeaker 0: Pinky rings, but I didn't mind Charles's pinky rings.\n\nSpeaker 4: You don't mind that? Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: And one of my proudest moments was when I I was over at the MOD, and he introduced me to some I think it was an American guy who was wandering around the place, and Charles said, this is this is Arash Arash Der Campbell. He's the Eshayesh of spin.\n\nSpeaker 4: Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which I was, you know, very good.\n\nSpeaker 4: That's a good good compliment from China.\n\nSpeaker 0: Here's one for you. Yep. Pakistan. Edmund Rose. Mhmm.\n\nI think I know what you're going to answer this as well. Is Imran Khan pluckily fighting a government which intent on staying in power and therefore trying to prevent him from campaigning and being elected, or is he a populist who is no better for his country well in power than the various other recent Pakistan prime ministers?\n\nSpeaker 4: Well, Imran Khan is definitely whatever you think about it. I mean, you know, somebody who was very, very well known in Britain, probably the most famous Pakistani, leader, I think, has ever been in Britain because he was an incredibly famous cricket star, married to Jemima Khan, Jamal Goldsmith, he undoubtedly has a lot of populist tendencies in the way he does politics. He's created a Whole change in Pakistani political culture. I used to go campaigning with Pakistani politicians in the early 2000. I remember driving around with one of the members of this Pakistani elite family.\n\nSo she was campaigning in rural Punjab, and she would we drove in the back of a car. The car would drive up to some men sitting on a string bed outside a collection of mud houses. The driver would put down the window, and he would say, In the back of this car is lady so and so, the daughter of mister so and so and the daughter of lady so and so. Will you vote for in the next election? And the men, it's a very feudal system, would basically stand off their string beds, Pull their forelock and say, and then the car would drive on, and that was political campaigning.\n\nSo in those days, Pakistani politics was dominated by these feudal landlords who often went back to the British Raj, who were descended from famous saints from the middle ages. And what's happened is Imran Khan has created a whole new coalition based on new urban money and youth. He was brought in with the backing of the military, tried to fight against the military. The military essentially threw him out. And there is absolutely no doubt, really, that if an election was held today, he seems to have an overwhelming support, which would bring him in again.\n\nBut the current government, which is being run by the brother of the the the previous prime minister, is technocratic, Focused on detail, efficient, and there is a culture war going on. Very classic culture war between somebody who's a sort of, Rishi Sunak figure, you know, very thoughtful, serious, technocratic detail against Imran Khan who absolutely represents Public opinion and can deploy huge crowds into the streets. And in the middle of all this is the Pakistan military that still effectively runs Pakistan.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's take this one. The the this both the main podcast and the q and a have been quite gloomy. Let's try and inject a bit of hope.\n\nAlex Mee, is there anything about the current political situation that gives you hope? Should I dare to feel hopeful about the future, or are we just on the giant island shaped Titanic slowly sinking further and further.\n\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Let me try first to get back to you. Thing that gives me hope is that we often talk about an age of populism, but actually there have been Very positive developments. We've talked about the fact that Biden defeated Trump, did well again in the midterms. We've talked about successes in Slovenia and Czech Republic, People fighting against populists, the teal independents in Australia.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bolsonaro gone.\n\nSpeaker 4: Bolsonaro gone. Boris Johnson gone. Liz Truss gone. So I think populism is still a very, very powerful force in a world of social media, but it isn't always gonna win. And perhaps the most optimistic of all is Macron Defeating Le Pen.\n\nBack to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: I do get hopeful when I do events like I did with the King's College guys yesterday who were Engaged. Interesting. Okay. They're political students, but I think there are a lot of people who are really interested in politics at the moment, but just worried about it. At Manchester City against Burnley on Saturday.\n\nI went with my son, Calum, and would get arrive on your way, and and the guy next to me was,\n\nSpeaker 4: You talk about this this match a lot. Was it What was because we played so well? It's the heat so well.\n\nSpeaker 0: We played so well. Oh, yeah. He's very, very good. You know? We as everybody said is I think Pep Guardiola said, and he's after much interview, you know, they were lucky to to get 6 nil.\n\nBut\n\nSpeaker 5: so and the 1st guy\n\nSpeaker 0: who came sat next to me was a guy called Mark, who I'd never met before. We got chatting about this, that, and the other, and eventually started talking a little bit about politics. And he said, like, don't be cross with me, but I've actually he was in his Forties, I'd say. This is Don't We Cross remover. I've never ever voted in my life.\n\nI've just never bothered, but I'm gonna vote this time because we've gotta get rid of these people. That gave me hope. Put it this way. If this government does hang on for another term, I really would feel hopeless about the future.\n\nSpeaker 4: You get you get depressed. Yeah. You'd you'd you'd move off to France or something.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I do honestly, I'm sure you get the same. I think it's hopeful that we've You know, I know you've seen it when you just back in London the last couple of days. The number of people who have come up to say really like your podcast, I think that is hopeful, because I think it says that people are engaged, want to be engaged, but don't quite know how to be engaged, which is why Alastair Campbell's book, But What Can I Do? May 11th, Penguin Random House is so timely, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 4: Yep. So Alastair Campbell's book, May 11th, Penguin Random House. You heard about it first here. Right. Thank you all very much.",
