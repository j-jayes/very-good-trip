How would Alastair and Rory rate it? And after 311 days, what would they do to help Ukraine conclude the war? What do you think about the speech first? Well, we were going to talk about this on the main podcast, but we got distracted into tea with Gordon Brown and Momolam and drugs and all sorts of other stuff. So apologies to those who wanted to hear about this on the main podcast. As I said on the main podcast, I thought Zelensky's New Year message was amongst the best pieces of communications I have ever seen. And to think of him doing that at a really difficult time. I I don't know about you, Rory, but I always find New Year really, really difficult psychologically for some reason. I always have major plunges around this time of year. But to do that when he's just come back from Washington, He's just had another sort of, you know, massive hit in in relation to the way the war is developing. And it was just it was, Look. It was 17 minutes long, which is a long time for 1 guy just to stand there and talk into a camera. There was a little bit of footage. There was film footage of some of the past. He told Some of the story what I loved about it was that he told a story, and it wasn't really about him. It was about the Ukrainian people, And it was about what they were doing and why they were doing it, and he he just it was the it was like watching a kind of jigsaw puzzle of emotion and story. And, also, the other thing he did was it's only been 311 days. There were so many things that I'd forgotten that had happened, and we've already forgotten them, and he was bringing them out there. And then when you got to the end of it, it was you felt this you did felt a sense you felt a sense of hope. It was it was incredible, wasn't it? And and I think the thing that makes a speech partly is real clarity, And there's a sense in that which we didn't see in any other politician's New Year messages. There's just one thing that he was talking about, which was victory, And he kept coming back to that. Yeah. And also the way in which a war leader, and he's a real war leader, can do things that no normal politician can do in terms of Oratory, and it was a very beautifully constructed speech. He he used a lot of that technique, which which Neil Kinnock loves, the tricolon, where you we put 3 phrases together. So he'd talk about warriors to their homes, captives to their houses, IDPs to Ukraine, or he'd say, this is why Each of us is here, why I'm here, why you are here. He also did he also did that thing that I I actually really like at his speech, but Tony Blair never never really went this much. But it's when you tell stories, and often you just have 1 word in a sentence. So you did the thing about you're telling a story about I can't remember the the child's name, but he just didn't said it. And then he said, Baby bomb died. You know? He just sort of had this it was almost like he was going from rat a tat and then slight change of tone. We said in the podcast just before New Year, you know, about there was some criticism of his wearing his fatigues at, when he went to speak in congress, but having that trademarked look. And he had that I don't know if you noticed the sort of setting of it. This sort of the flag was there, but it was very vague. It was actually quite a dark setting. Yeah. Was was he not outdoors? Was he not outdoors? Definitely. He was outdoors, and it was freezing cold. And he just sort of stood there, and he just kind of and I I guess It must have been scripted. There must have been an autocue, but maybe not because there was a very natural communication. There were definitely elements that were beautifully written, which he must have either memorized or or to keep, but but I I I thought it was extraordinary. Pew did you see Putin's speech? See Putin's speech. Putin, as usual, manages to Every speech she gives gives the impression he's standing in front of a blue screen and and that there's a sort of some weird virtual reality thing. I mean, there were people behind him moving. They were military, weren't they? Yeah. Except for 1 lady who Clarissa Ward, who's the CNN international correspondent, has picked up, appears in almost every image with Putin. She appeared in that Image. She appears with an image of him on a boat. She appears with him in church. So there was a lot of discussion on Twitter on whether she was a a bodyguard or an actor, But eventually, they've decided she's a woman called Svetlana Radchenko who's his junior environment minister who for some astonishing reason he puts in Every single shot that he appears in. But she was, you're right, in a military uniform. Well, I do you think there might be something going on there that I don't even know who the current missus Putin is, but whether there might be something she should object Something very peculiar going on there. And it was an odd speech. I mean, of course, in in its way, it did the business for his audience, and what he does, like many, many extreme nationalist leaders, is this extreme clarification, black and white. So he he said in his speech, this year clarified things. It clarified the difference between heroism and cowardice. It revealed through the difficult situation in Donbas that the West that had been pretending to try to resolve it had She's secretly all along been plotting with the neo Nazis to do these war crimes. So in its way, I think it did its business, but, of course, he looked very, very stiff Compared to Zelensky, I mean, you really felt Zelensky vindicated being outdoors in his combat fatigues. Putin Looks elderly. His face looks over Botoxed. I'm saying all this because the Russians obviously have banned me from ever going to Russia again, which makes me a little bit bitter. By the way, I got a question for somebody called Samantha Powell. Why she said, you often talk about things that the the mainstream media don't give Sufficient coverage too. Why has there been so little coverage of the comments by sir Jeffrey Nice? And this is that Do you know who Jeffrey Neistat? He's the guy who led the prosecution of Milosevic, and he did an interview on the on the BBC setting out why Putin Should be should go on trial for war crimes committed in Ukraine, which I did think was quite a bit. This this is a guy who knows the Geneva Convention and knows the rules of war inside out, and who was giving a pretty compelling case that Putin should go on trial for war crimes. That's fantastic. And it's a surprise that that people aren't talking about this more openly. Yeah. Yeah. No. That's that's I guess I guess For for people like Macron who are trying to find a route out for Putin, they're they'd be reluctant politically to go down that route, wouldn't they? Well, On that, Rory, I wasn't going to raise it, but I'm now going to raise it because I did have a few little messages from some of my French friends, can I put it like that, Who felt that you'd been a bit harsh on Macron, although you did say he was your politician foreign politician of the year, but they felt that you were caricaturing his position on Ukraine? That it is not a sort of black and white, as you think, of Biden thinking it's gotta be all that war to the end and Macron thinking there has to be negotiation. And one of these people, Sophie Pedder, who's the bureau chief in Paris of The Economist, she sent me a message saying, take get Rory to take a look at the Ukrainian defense minister's response to Macron's Macron's New Year address. And the defense ministry is called Andrei Zogorodunnik, And he says, kudos to Macron. His post in Ukrainian language, link below, where he says France and Europe will be supporting us to a victory is a very strategic statement as the western allies join us in in anticipation the war must end with victory. We are. That's good. Good. Well, well done, Sophie Petter. Well, we look forward to reading more of her stuff. Okay. Question for you. Hugh Walker, as Israel shifts violently to the right, you continually avoid any discussion of it. Why? And just to give you some time to think about your answer just for listeners to bring them up to date on that, what's happened, of course, is that Bibi Nissinayu is coming back in and he's coming back in with a very, very odd coalition, including some Extremely unfortunate figures who've made unbelievably unpleasant and threatening remarks, including about retaking the West Bank and others. So why why don't we talk more about Israel? I guess because well, what we have talked about. The first thing I need to say is we have talked about Israel, and we've talked about Netanyahu and his comeback. And I think I told the story not long ago about John Holmes, Tony Blair's former foreign affairs adviser saying in 1997, Netanyahu was a 24 carat bullshitter. We have talked about it. What but I think what's happened is that we're back to the point about when things are not high up, the actual political agenda. So, of course, a new Israeli election is newsworthy. Netanyahu coming back is newsworthy. But has it moved the dial on the Middle East peace process? Insofar as it has, it's it's moved it backwards. And that just there then just becomes a danger that, well, what do we Keep saying other than the fact that we you you and I, I'm sure, are in pretty much the same place. We believe in a a two state solution. We think that the Americans have got a key role to play. They are trying to play that role, but it becomes very, very difficult when you have this coalition put together. So what are we going to say about Israel Other than what you've already just said, which is that Netanyahu is a pretty bad guy who's done a lot of bad things, and he's now surrounded by really bad guys who've said and done a lot of really, really bad things. Yeah. I mean, I think that that the people and, again, I mean, if I'm getting pushback on Macron, I'll definitely get an enormous natural pushback from from friends of mine on this. But Part of the trouble seems to be the religious Zionism party, which is led by a man called Bezalel Smotrich, which is very, very ultranationalist. He's the finance minister now, isn't he? I'm sure people are gonna push back and and, come back on us on this too. He said, by the way, Just and, again, maybe we should because we did talk a little bit about God in our last episode of 2022. So they now have, As the deputy minister in the prime minister's office, they've got somebody who is, apparently, homophobic. That's Abi Maers. They've got this guy that you talk you you've just mentioned who's now the finance minister whose whose big slogan is that it's time for Israel to try obeying god's commandments as an economic approach. How is that one gonna work out? So I don't quite know. I whoever asked us that question, what do they want us to talk about, Israel, other than what we've said many, many times, which is that It's deeply concerning. It's really hard to see how it's gonna get resolved, but it only gets resolved if the international community, and particularly the Americans, Stay absolutely fixated on trying to get it resolved. And reengage because there is a sense that that, as I think we've talked about in the past, that over the last 20, 30 years, the Attention in the world has very much moved away from Israel, Palestine that increasingly the Gulf, which was a sort of back quarter 40 years ago, now Saudi and UAE are very much front and centre, And the cultural centers of the Arab world, which were, you know, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, Palestine, have very much Been marginalized from the Arab Spring onwards. Abraham Accords meant that Israel's now created all these new economic links. So I I think there is a sense in which people are are no longer really engaged. Yeah. We well, I think they're engaged, but it's very hard to know how you get it to the point in the international agenda where you can You start to make change. Particularly now you've got an Israeli government that is going to be even more hard line than the ones that we've already got, you know, all too used to. Right. Right. March here's 1, Rory. March in fever year. Yes. I'm assuming that's a real name as opposed to a prediction for 2023. Could you please explain the definition of populism? It's a term that you use all the time, but I don't understand it. I well, would you wanna have a go first? Yeah. Yeah. Can I have a go first? So, the the the first thing I think about populism in its modern form is it involves presenting yourself as speaking for the people Against the elite, but the people that you're speaking for is always called the real people, and it's not actual. It's not all the people, obviously, and often it's not even the majority of the people. It's a particular often nationalist nativist appeal to a section of the population that tries to represent themselves as though they're everybody And treat anyone who disagrees with them, minority groups and others, as though they are a feat, out of touch, treacherous elites, And that gives them the legitimacy to challenge constitutions. Anyway, back to you. No. I well, I I I would I would agree with that. I think it's I think a classic definition Is this a form of politics whereby the view of, what the politician represents as the people is turned against what the politician represents as an a an out of touch elite. And even though the politician may be Trump, Johnson, as elitist as they come, particularly with the help now of technology, they have the tools to make that effective as a political strategy. Now here's 1, Roy. You this this is, Wait. Wait. Wait. Don't know. Just very quickly, this this this is a strange thing because you just asked me a question from a man who was called what was he called? Fever? Fever. Yeah. Well, here's a question for someone called Jack Lefevre. So if China were to invade Taiwan, would there be a similar global to Russia's invasions, Ukraine are markedly different. I I I agree it's slightly off topic, but the name, that's an interesting coincidence. So the with the our question our choice of questions is now being driven by the name of the person. Roy, you got to remember, we get a lot of complaints about why we don't so for example, we've already had why don't you talk about Israel? I've spotted 3 already recently. Why don't you haven't you talked about Venezuela? So I think that what we should say to people, just say that your name has something related to fever, And we're bound to listen. And the answer to the question is I think the reaction will be even more dramatic. Well, anyway, Rory, I was It'll be unbelievable because we've talked about sorry. Just very quickly, we've talked about semiconductor chips and the fact that 90% of the advanced semiconductor chips in the world are made in Taiwan and 50% of all, 80% of the electric batteries in the world are made in China. I mean, one of the reasons why, it's tough For Keir Starmer and others to talk about green growth plans and investing in gigafactories for batteries and things is that China has taken the march on that as it has on so much else. And Sanctions and counter sanctions against China is gonna have the most catastrophic impact on our economy, but I think we'll do it, but I think China and the rest of the world will suffer deeply, And what I think already is likely to be a prolonged recession will get much, much worse. Now, Rory, 3 3 quick points to make. The first is that Somebody that we know up here in the Scottish Highlands Yep. Who's a very is a regular listener to the podcast Yep. Said, what On Earth is Rory doing saying there's a 40% chance of this Chinese invasion of Taiwan happening, and what is he based that on? And I'm gonna give you a couple of little pointers that maybe you can help make him even more terrified. The first is that The Taiwan's president has rewritten the conscription rules in Taiwan That all Taiwanese males who turn 18 next year are going to have to serve 12 months in the military rather than the present. I think the current system is 4 months. And the second thing is I saw a report, I think it was in The Times, which was a discussion going on inside the UK government, saying that Britain is very badly prepared for the possible economic consequences that would result from the Chinese invasion of Taiwan, that it would cripple supply chains, it would lead to COVID style shortages of imports, and the industry's leaders Need to think very, very hard about where they're gonna get goods from. Yeah. It's well, it's it's it's terrible, isn't it? Because, of course, that's true in Britain. It's It's true right the way across Europe and the United States, and the problem is that insuring yourself against that, having the resilience to deal with losing your Supply chain from China is incredibly expensive. I mean, it would involve incredible investments in setting up alternative supply chains. Why do I think 40% Well, as we've discussed in the past, And there's a couple of good recent biographies of Xi Jinping. You you promoted a really good German one. There's there's also another good English language one, which is quite a scholarly biography. But In both cases, they make it very, very clear that the issue of Taiwan has been central to Xi Jinping's political identity almost from the beginning of his time, and it's it's very, very likely that he will see unifying China or bringing Bringing Taiwan into China as being the legacy he wants and the it's just a question of time. There are 2 things in balance, which is why we're at 40%, not 60%, Which is balancing the fact that he hasn't quite got the Chinese military and navy where he wants it to be to absolutely guarantee an easy victory in Taiwan, But that has to be weighed against the fact that if I were he, I would think this is quite a good moment to move because it's a moment where the west is already thrown off balance by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So It cuts both ways. I do think the response that Britain, Europe, United States have brought to Ukraine Has been an important deterrent against Xi Jinping's actions, but it also will suggest to him that we are economically in a very difficult situation, and it'll be quite difficult, he will feel, To say to our voters who are already facing this unbelievable inflation and energy costs that we're going to take sanctions and counter sanctions over Taiwan, which would be 10, 20 times worse than anything we've seen to date. Alright, Roy. Let's go for a break. Welcome back to the Restless Politics question time. Now bringing it home again, this goes back to something we discussed last time, and I want to revisit this because I don't I don't think I I don't think I said what I really think. Okay. News 23 slash 5. In a recent episode, Rory was passionate about maintaining the UK's green belt in relation to constructing new homes, Yet he never seems to stop traveling, especially flying. How does he balance his position with his carbon footprint? Lucien Lawrence, Rory said he wants to protect the green belt from housing and build Hire in London to reduce housing scarcity. How does he propose to the latter with such resistance to new development in both law and local nimbyism? And I if you remember, Roy, last time, you you I didn't realize that that being asked the question about the green belt, and I said I was broadly in favor. I don't think I I think I'd said that because I was just sort of Thinking aloud. I actually don't see how we are I think the green belt risks becoming a kind of totem that there has to be I agree with you. There should be a broader Environmental strategy, environmental policy, but we are going to have to build more homes, and we are going to have to build them in places where currently we don't build. And I think we cannot forever, just say that because we've got this green belt thing, it's like some sort of sacrosanct totem that we can no no we can never touch in the future. Okay. Well, that's very interesting. I'm I'm that's good good. We've got I'm on the other side of this because I think if If you give up on the green belts not just in London, but around our other cities, you will create exactly the kind of urban sprawl that you see in the United States, And we're not a large enough country to accommodate that. It will you can see so many parts of our country that are now really wrecked, and I think at a time when nature and biodiversity It's under huge threat in Britain. It would be horrible to build over the green belt, and I think there's such potential to make it a much more biodiverse landscape. And I do think the real problem in London is our obsession on building, you know, low 2 storey houses which sprawl all the way out Metroland all the way out through West London. And I think freeing up planning, a brave government freed up planning that would allow people to double the size of their houses, Put a flat on top and rent it out? And and go down below? And go down below. But I think going up is the easiest thing. It can be done very easily, and there's some very good examples of it already happening in London. Did you see did you see, the the in in Tokyo, the the the Japanese now are paying people to leave Tokyo. Very interesting. Do you think do you think we might have to move eventually to a kinda new generation of of Milton Keynes type, developments? Well, Yeah, definitely, definitely Milton Keynes was actually in a way a real success and I think building really ambitious new towns is a way of dealing with it and thinking about what I would call Gentle density, which is building at 6, 7 stories, which is of course what makes the beauty of Paris, is a very well good way of thinking about it, not 40, 50 stories, Which actually in UK law, you need to have so much standoff around the base of them that they're not really worth doing, but going for the gentle density. Question for you, Chris Cartlidge. Why don't we have ministers with more industrial backgrounds? Eiji, surely the minister for transport should have some experience managing transport infrastructure. Same for other minister roles, question mark. But I think we're back to the thing about, you know, why don't why don't people from a far broader Network and Jean Paul will go into politics. I mean, I'm always struck when I do events with business, some of which I did with you last year, where when you get into sort of people asking questions, they will there's always a question about, you know, why does the quality of politicians seem to four and why have so few people who've from this background, that back background got into politics. And it's easy to blame politics as some kind of abstract, but I always say to these people, well, have Have any of you ever thought of going into politics? And, you know, sort of there's lots of uncomfortable shuffling in their seats, and occasionally, somebody might put their hand and say, well, I did think about it, but I didn't like the intrusion into my life or whatever it might be. So, you know, I I don't think it's impossible for people look, it's hard. It's still hard to get into politics and that more people want to be MPs And there are places by a long, long chore. But I think that one of the you know, whoever's asking that question is right on one level That it'd be good if we had people from a a far broader range of professional backgrounds, but we're only going to get that if people from those backgrounds today. I am going to go in and make a difference. Well, the the other solution, of course, which I favor is is the much more radical one, which is to say that the problem is that you're Dragging your ministers out of this very limited pool. So Yeah. You know, the recent government's had about 303 120 MPs, of which they're trying to Find a 100 ministers, and most of these people on both sides are professional politicians who know very little about the rest of the world because they've been local counsellors and they've been local party members since university, And frankly, people with other kinds of jobs don't don't really go into politics, so the answer, of course, is to go to more of a US system where you Can appoint a cabinet that doesn't come from your MPs. I mean, I was always struck that when we had Philip Hammond and Michael Fallon and Gavin Williamson as defense secretaries, and these were people who'd taken zero interests in defense before they became Defense factories. I mean, there were people who I remember joking that they didn't know the difference between a a javelin and a tomahawk. And up against I know the difference. There there isn't there isn't an event in the Olympics for the Tomahawk. There we are. Beautiful. On the other side, you've got the US where they were sitting opposite Ash Carter, who was a defense academic or general Maitlis, who'd been the head of the US Marine Corps, You know, it's a very, very different situation. It's sort of unthinkable in the US system. Yeah. Yeah. But, Roy, you're you're argue you're arguing for a totally different political system then because, You know, I don't think you can envisage a situation where you have an elected prime minister who then appoints cabinet ministers from wherever he or she wants and stick them in the House of Lords, which is now, I think, so discredited as a particular institution. And then that's what Gordon Brown did, isn't it? I mean, he that was his government of all talents. He tried to do that, didn't he? No. No. Well, there were 1 or 2 ministers, Adam West, the the naval guy, and you can see why there's a case for that. But if you feel that Mallett Brown in the foreign office Yeah. But they weren't Peter Mandelson. They weren't cabinet ministers. Peter Mandelson, he Put them in the cabinet? Put them in the Lords to get them in the cabinet? That's true. That's true. But so so but I'd say that was an exceptional rule. You're you're sort of saying the prime minister should have even more power to decide who they want around that that table and then less accountability to parliament. Well, I'd I'd want, I'd want something much more. I'd want a separation between the To such a and the executive. Yes. You are you are arguing for a completely different political system. Yeah. 100%. Now what about what about, this one, hot buzz? As Scotland would have celebrated 50 years in the EEC EU today, this is when the question was sent in, And many of their employee rights are about to go on a potential bonfire. Do you feel any empathy at all for those Scots who may now want a different future for themselves and their country because of Brexit. PS, happy New Year. PS, I I I do have sympathy. I I remain very I mean, I think 2 2 quick things. 1 is I think Scotland would have a tough time joining the European Union, and most of its trading relationships are, of course, within the United Kingdom, And it would then find itself facing significant barriers, trading with its biggest trading partner if it suddenly joined the EU single markets and customs union because it would find itself In some version of the situation which Germany now finds itself in, where German UK trade has collapsed over the last few years, I also think that, As we talked about when we discussed Kosovo and Montenegro joining the European Union, there are many countries, European Union, that are very, very unwilling To allow in countries that are separated from other countries because if you're Spain or indeed the 4 other countries that are currently blocking Montenegrin accession, They have strong internal reasons not to favor nationalisms in their own countries. By the way, did you see that the border was shut briefly in Kosovo Serbia. Very good. Yeah. No. I mean, I agree. It's and and and that that's a prediction, I think, that sadly may may prove right that the The chance for conflict again on the European conflict. Oh, I've triggered I've triggered Rory into predicting another war. That's it. I like predictors. Dilly dally, this links this. Make a controversial political prediction for 2023, and each suggest a forfeit for the other if they get it wrong. I don't know if this is controversial, but a political prediction I will make, I can already see the beginnings of it the client journalists who are basically in the pocket of the the the worst prime minister in history, the the blonde one well, the blonde male one. And that is that Johnson will try to effect some sort of comeback. But I I I hope this is this is maybe wishful thinking, but I If there is any real respect for truth and parliamentary sovereignty that he claims to believe in, then I hope he will be thwarted by the Current, I believe, still ongoing inquiry into whether he lied to parliament, and that his career will be ended by that. Okay. Here's my political prediction. I think the Republican Party in Congress is gonna tear itself to shreds. There's a really interesting thing happening at the moment with the election speaker, Kevin McCarthy, where he's basically being blocked by 5 or 6 extreme right wing republicans. He's falling over backwards to try to pander to them, including saying he's gonna impeach the Homeland Security Secretary and set up new committees to overturn everything that was done to January 6th. He's got Trump calling for him, and he still can't win them over. And it reminds me a lot of the way in which the right wing of the Tory party took over And destroyed any attempts by Theresa May to get a compromise on Brexit because one of the elements of it is that the rights of these parties Seems to hold the whip hand by refusing to compromise, and you find yourself in a very odd situation which is had the Democrats been willing To come across and actually a few moderate democrats vote for him, they could have marginalized this right wing group. But, of course, democrats are never gonna do that, and the Republican party will be dragged ever further to the right. Now, Rory, we did say that part of the question which you're avoiding was what are the forfeits if you're wrong. I am going to suggest that if you're proved to be wrong Yep. What what what's the time limit? You this is your prediction for this year. Yeah? This year. Yep. Yep. Okay. I'm going to suggest that the 4th of you should be the the the live event that we do closest to that time when this year ends. Yep. You have to end it playing the bagpipes, not me. Oh, jeez. Wow. Okay. That's very tough. Alright. Okay. So So that's a that's a good that's a good incentive for you to do a bit of practice. That really? Blimey. That's a big incentive to do a bit of practice. Wow. Okay. Full fit for you. If you are proven to be wrong, you have to go and give a speech at Eton. Oh, Well, I've been asked to do a speech at Eton many times, and maybe the new head teacher or is it do we still call him a headmaster? Headmaster. Headmaster. Headmaster, who, by the way, we are having on as a guest on the podcast one day. We are, Rory. I'm telling you not now. We're doing maybe we could do it. Maybe we could do that at Eton in front of all the boys. Yep. Well, there we are. That's a possibility. But but that's your that's that's your forfeit. I was I was hoping you were gonna make me swim in the cold water. And Would you rather do that than play the bagpipes? I'd I'd rather do that. Would you? Okay. No. And the the the thing I was the point I was gonna make is that the last time that I was invited to go and speak to, I said, I will do it as long as I can bring I can bring a TV crew with me. And they said, oh, we let's just let's just put it put it on hold for now. Put put it on hold for now. Good. Alright. Well, Alastair, thank you very much. It's been a jolly jolly 50th birthday party. Thank you. Well, listen, Rory, as it is your birthday, the the other thing I I -As I am up in Scotland, we got a lot of questions about because I tweeted, going to see Charles Kennedy's grave and playing the bible. I always go every year where we're up there and play the lament that was played at his funeral. And, Heather, it it gets you always talk about, you know, Twitter being a horrible place, and and often it is. But this year, I had, like, I don't know. It's up to a 1000000 views and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of nice comments and people remembering Charles and and so forth. So it's not always horrible, And I think that's because it's music. And the other thing I'm planning for this year, Rory Yep. I plan to I plan to try to to get you to become generally more musical. My musical highlight of the year so far yesterday, we have a friend of ours, Catherine McLeod, who you may know was a journalist, and then she worked for Alice O'Donnell. And we went to she was up staying with us, and we went to see, some of her friends yesterday. And 2 of them, Megan and Ewan, they are in a very, very Famous folk band called Brayback. And Mhmm. I'm they said that if I mentioned James Lindsay, their double bass player, He loves the podcast so much, he will probably have a heart attack. I don't want him to have a heart attack, but I want him to know that Meghan and Ewan Put on a special performance just for us yesterday. It was absolutely brilliant. And in that spirit, Rory, Yeah. Given the day that this is, if you just sit very tight, sit very, very tight Yeah. And I'll be back with you in a moment. Hold on. Alright. Go on then. Sitting tight. How was that? It was really lovely, Alastair. Thank you very, very, very much. How do you think the drone sounded? Well, I I see this is the problem. I'm not properly musical. I this is why I think I've got a weird relationship with Idra like my father. My father was very musical and believed I just wasn't making enough of an effort. But I do think it's not just a question of effort. I think there's something wrong with my ear. I played the pipes at a New Year's Eve thing down in Argyll, this little brewery called the Argyll Ales, And I was the only person you'd think the Scottish Highlands would be sort of crawling with people who play the bagpipes. I was the only one there who could play the bagpipes. They asked me to play, And it was freezing, freezing cold. And the the backpipes this sounds weird, but they hate changes in temperature. So the fact is, Roy, my drones were off there slightly because I didn't want to spend the the requisite 15 minutes tuning them up just so you could just so you could sit there They're waiting for me to play happy birthday. But, anyway, I hope you have a lovely birthday, and, we'll speak again next week. Speak next week. Lots of",

And after 311 days, what would they do to help Ukraine conclude the war? What do you think about the speech first?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, we were going to talk about this on the main podcast, but we got distracted into tea with Gordon Brown and Momolam and drugs and all sorts of other stuff. So apologies to those who wanted to hear about this on the main podcast. As I said on the main podcast, I thought Zelensky's New Year message was amongst the best pieces of communications I have ever seen. And to think of him doing that at a really difficult time. I I don't know about you, Rory, but I always find New Year really, really difficult psychologically for some reason.\n\nI always have major plunges around this time of year. But to do that when he's just come back from Washington, He's just had another sort of, you know, massive hit in in relation to the way the war is developing. And it was just it was, Look. It was 17 minutes long, which is a long time for 1 guy just to stand there and talk into a camera. There was a little bit of footage.\n\nThere was film footage of some of the past. He told Some of the story what I loved about it was that he told a story, and it wasn't really about him. It was about the Ukrainian people, And it was about what they were doing and why they were doing it, and he he just it was the it was like watching a kind of jigsaw puzzle of emotion and story. And, also, the other thing he did was it's only been 311 days. There were so many things that I'd forgotten that had happened, and we've already forgotten them, and he was bringing them out there.\n\nAnd then when you got to the end of it, it was you felt this you did felt a sense you felt a sense of hope.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was it was incredible, wasn't it? And and I think the thing that makes a speech partly is real clarity, And there's a sense in that which we didn't see in any other politician's New Year messages. There's just one thing that he was talking about, which was victory, And he kept coming back to that. Yeah. And also the way in which a war leader, and he's a real war leader, can do things that no normal politician can do in terms of Oratory, and it was a very beautifully constructed speech.\n\nHe he used a lot of that technique, which which Neil Kinnock loves, the tricolon, where you we put 3 phrases together. So he'd talk about warriors to their homes, captives to their houses, IDPs to Ukraine, or he'd say, this is why Each of us is here, why I'm here, why you are here.\n\nSpeaker 0: He also did he also did that thing that I I actually really like at his speech, but Tony Blair never never really went this much. But it's when you tell stories, and often you just have 1 word in a sentence. So you did the thing about you're telling a story about I can't remember the the child's name, but he just didn't said it. And then he said, Baby bomb died. You know?\n\nHe just sort of had this it was almost like he was going from rat a tat and then slight change of tone. We said in the podcast just before New Year, you know, about there was some criticism of his wearing his fatigues at, when he went to speak in congress, but having that trademarked look. And he had that I don't know if you noticed the sort of setting of it. This sort of the flag was there, but it was very vague. It was actually quite a dark setting.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Was was he not outdoors? Was he not outdoors?\n\nSpeaker 0: Definitely. He was outdoors, and it was freezing cold. And he just sort of stood there, and he just kind of and I I guess It must have been scripted. There must have been an autocue, but maybe not because there was a very natural communication.\n\nSpeaker 1: There were definitely elements that were beautifully written, which he must have either memorized or or to keep, but but I I I thought it was extraordinary.\n\nSpeaker 0: Pew did you see Putin's\n\nSpeaker 1: speech? See Putin's speech. Putin, as usual, manages to Every speech she gives gives the impression he's standing in front of a blue screen and and that there's a sort of some weird virtual reality thing. I mean, there were people behind him moving.\n\nSpeaker 0: They were military, weren't they?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Except for 1 lady who Clarissa Ward, who's the CNN international correspondent, has picked up, appears in almost every image with Putin. She appeared in that Image. She appears with an image of him on a boat. She appears with him in church.\n\nSo there was a lot of discussion on Twitter on whether she was a a bodyguard or an actor, But eventually, they've decided she's a woman called Svetlana Radchenko who's his junior environment minister who for some astonishing reason he puts in Every single shot that he appears in. But she was, you're right, in a military uniform.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I do you think there might be something going on there that I don't even know who the current missus Putin is, but whether there might be something she should object\n\nSpeaker 1: Something very peculiar going on there. And it was an odd speech. I mean, of course, in in its way, it did the business for his audience, and what he does, like many, many extreme nationalist leaders, is this extreme clarification, black and white. So he he said in his speech, this year clarified things. It clarified the difference between heroism and cowardice.\n\nIt revealed through the difficult situation in Donbas that the West that had been pretending to try to resolve it had She's secretly all along been plotting with the neo Nazis to do these war crimes. So in its way, I think it did its business, but, of course, he looked very, very stiff Compared to Zelensky, I mean, you really felt Zelensky vindicated being outdoors in his combat fatigues. Putin Looks elderly. His face looks over Botoxed. I'm saying all this because the Russians obviously have banned me from ever going to Russia again, which makes me a little bit bitter.\n\nSpeaker 0: By the way, I got a question for somebody called Samantha Powell. Why she said, you often talk about things that the the mainstream media don't give Sufficient coverage too. Why has there been so little coverage of the comments by sir Jeffrey Nice? And this is that Do you know who Jeffrey Neistat? He's the guy who led the prosecution of Milosevic, and he did an interview on the on the BBC setting out why Putin Should be should go on trial for war crimes committed in Ukraine, which I did think was quite a bit.\n\nThis this is a guy who knows the Geneva Convention and knows the rules of war inside out, and who was giving a pretty compelling case that Putin should go on trial for war crimes.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's fantastic. And it's a surprise that that people aren't talking about this more openly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. That's that's I guess I guess For for people like Macron who are trying to find a route out for Putin, they're they'd be reluctant politically to go down that route, wouldn't they?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, On that, Rory, I wasn't going to raise it, but I'm now going to raise it because I did have a few little messages from some of my French friends, can I put it like that, Who felt that you'd been a bit harsh on Macron, although you did say he was your politician foreign politician of the year, but they felt that you were caricaturing his position on Ukraine? That it is not a sort of black and white, as you think, of Biden thinking it's gotta be all that war to the end and Macron thinking there has to be negotiation. And one of these people, Sophie Pedder, who's the bureau chief in Paris of The Economist, she sent me a message saying, take get Rory to take a look at the Ukrainian defense minister's response to Macron's Macron's New Year address. And the defense ministry is called Andrei Zogorodunnik, And he says, kudos to Macron. His post in Ukrainian language, link below, where he says France and Europe will be supporting us to a victory is a very strategic statement as the western allies join us in in anticipation the war must end with victory.\n\nSpeaker 1: We are. That's good. Good. Well, well done, Sophie Petter. Well, we look forward to reading more of her stuff.\n\nOkay. Question for you. Hugh Walker, as Israel shifts violently to the right, you continually avoid any discussion of it. Why? And just to give you some time to think about your answer just for listeners to bring them up to date on that, what's happened, of course, is that Bibi Nissinayu is coming back in and he's coming back in with a very, very odd coalition, including some Extremely unfortunate figures who've made unbelievably unpleasant and threatening remarks, including about retaking the West Bank and others.\n\nSo why why don't we talk more about Israel?\n\nSpeaker 0: I guess because well, what we have talked about. The first thing I need to say is we have talked about Israel, and we've talked about Netanyahu and his comeback. And I think I told the story not long ago about John Holmes, Tony Blair's former foreign affairs adviser saying in 1997, Netanyahu was a 24 carat bullshitter. We have talked about it. What but I think what's happened is that we're back to the point about when things are not high up, the actual political agenda.\n\nSo, of course, a new Israeli election is newsworthy. Netanyahu coming back is newsworthy. But has it moved the dial on the Middle East peace process? Insofar as it has, it's it's moved it backwards. And that just there then just becomes a danger that, well, what do we Keep saying other than the fact that we you you and I, I'm sure, are in pretty much the same place.\n\nWe believe in a a two state solution. We think that the Americans have got a key role to play. They are trying to play that role, but it becomes very, very difficult when you have this coalition put together. So what are we going to say about Israel Other than what you've already just said, which is that Netanyahu is a pretty bad guy who's done a lot of bad things, and he's now surrounded by really bad guys who've said and done a lot of really, really bad things.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, I think that that the people and, again, I mean, if I'm getting pushback on Macron, I'll definitely get an enormous natural pushback from from friends of mine on this. But Part of the trouble seems to be the religious Zionism party, which is led by a man called Bezalel Smotrich, which is very, very ultranationalist.\n\nSpeaker 0: He's the finance minister now, isn't he?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm sure people are gonna push back and and, come back on us on this too.\n\nSpeaker 0: He said, by the way, Just and, again, maybe we should because we did talk a little bit about God in our last episode of 2022. So they now have, As the deputy minister in the prime minister's office, they've got somebody who is, apparently, homophobic. That's Abi Maers. They've got this guy that you talk you you've just mentioned who's now the finance minister whose whose big slogan is that it's time for Israel to try obeying god's commandments as an economic approach. How is that one gonna work out?\n\nSo I don't quite know. I whoever asked us that question, what do they want us to talk about, Israel, other than what we've said many, many times, which is that It's deeply concerning. It's really hard to see how it's gonna get resolved, but it only gets resolved if the international community, and particularly the Americans, Stay absolutely fixated on trying to get it resolved.\n\nSpeaker 1: And reengage because there is a sense that that, as I think we've talked about in the past, that over the last 20, 30 years, the Attention in the world has very much moved away from Israel, Palestine that increasingly the Gulf, which was a sort of back quarter 40 years ago, now Saudi and UAE are very much front and centre, And the cultural centers of the Arab world, which were, you know, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, Palestine, have very much Been marginalized from the Arab Spring onwards. Abraham Accords meant that Israel's now created all these new economic links. So I I think there is a sense in which people are are no longer really engaged. Yeah. We\n\nSpeaker 0: well, I think they're engaged, but it's very hard to know how you get it to the point in the international agenda where you can You start to make change. Particularly now you've got an Israeli government that is going to be even more hard line than the ones that we've already got, you know, all too used to.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. March here's 1, Rory. March in fever year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm assuming that's a real name as opposed to a prediction for 2023. Could you please explain the definition of populism? It's a term that you use all the time, but I don't understand it. I well, would you wanna have a go first? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Can I have a go first? So, the the the first thing I think about populism in its modern form is it involves presenting yourself as speaking for the people Against the elite, but the people that you're speaking for is always called the real people, and it's not actual. It's not all the people, obviously, and often it's not even the majority of the people. It's a particular often nationalist nativist appeal to a section of the population that tries to represent themselves as though they're everybody And treat anyone who disagrees with them, minority groups and others, as though they are a feat, out of touch, treacherous elites, And that gives them the legitimacy to challenge constitutions.\n\nAnyway, back to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I well, I I I would I would agree with that. I think it's I think a classic definition Is this a form of politics whereby the view of, what the politician represents as the people is turned against what the politician represents as an a an out of touch elite. And even though the politician may be Trump, Johnson, as elitist as they come, particularly with the help now of technology, they have the tools to make that effective as a political strategy. Now here's 1, Roy.\n\nYou this this is,\n\nSpeaker 1: Wait. Wait. Wait. Don't know. Just very quickly, this this this is a strange thing because you just asked me a question from a man who was called what was he called?\n\nFever?\n\nSpeaker 0: Fever. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, here's a question for someone called Jack Lefevre. So if China were to invade Taiwan, would there be a similar global to Russia's invasions, Ukraine are markedly different. I I I agree it's slightly off topic, but the name, that's an interesting coincidence.\n\nSpeaker 0: So the with the our question our choice of questions is now being driven by the name of the person. Roy, you got to remember, we get a lot of complaints about why we don't so for example, we've already had why don't you talk about Israel? I've spotted 3 already recently. Why don't you haven't you talked about Venezuela? So I think that what we should say to people, just say that your name has something related to fever, And we're bound to listen.\n\nAnd the answer to the question is I think the reaction will be even more dramatic. Well, anyway, Rory, I\n\nSpeaker 1: was It'll be unbelievable because we've talked about sorry. Just very quickly, we've talked about semiconductor chips and the fact that 90% of the advanced semiconductor chips in the world are made in Taiwan and 50% of all, 80% of the electric batteries in the world are made in China. I mean, one of the reasons why, it's tough For Keir Starmer and others to talk about green growth plans and investing in gigafactories for batteries and things is that China has taken the march on that as it has on so much else. And Sanctions and counter sanctions against China is gonna have the most catastrophic impact on our economy, but I think we'll do it, but I think China and the rest of the world will suffer deeply, And what I think already is likely to be a prolonged recession will get much, much worse.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now, Rory, 3 3 quick points to make. The first is that Somebody that we know up here in the Scottish Highlands Yep. Who's a very is a regular listener to the podcast Yep. Said, what On Earth is Rory doing saying there's a 40% chance of this Chinese invasion of Taiwan happening, and what is he based that on? And I'm gonna give you a couple of little pointers that maybe you can help make him even more terrified.\n\nThe first is that The Taiwan's president has rewritten the conscription rules in Taiwan That all Taiwanese males who turn 18 next year are going to have to serve 12 months in the military rather than the present. I think the current system is 4 months. And the second thing is I saw a report, I think it was in The Times, which was a discussion going on inside the UK government, saying that Britain is very badly prepared for the possible economic consequences that would result from the Chinese invasion of Taiwan, that it would cripple supply chains, it would lead to COVID style shortages of imports, and the industry's leaders Need to think very, very hard about where they're gonna get goods from.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's well, it's it's it's terrible, isn't it? Because, of course, that's true in Britain. It's It's true right the way across Europe and the United States, and the problem is that insuring yourself against that, having the resilience to deal with losing your Supply chain from China is incredibly expensive. I mean, it would involve incredible investments in setting up alternative supply chains.\n\nWhy do I think 40% Well, as we've discussed in the past, And there's a couple of good recent biographies of Xi Jinping. You you promoted a really good German one. There's there's also another good English language one, which is quite a scholarly biography. But In both cases, they make it very, very clear that the issue of Taiwan has been central to Xi Jinping's political identity almost from the beginning of his time, and it's it's very, very likely that he will see unifying China or bringing Bringing Taiwan into China as being the legacy he wants and the it's just a question of time. There are 2 things in balance, which is why we're at 40%, not 60%, Which is balancing the fact that he hasn't quite got the Chinese military and navy where he wants it to be to absolutely guarantee an easy victory in Taiwan, But that has to be weighed against the fact that if I were he, I would think this is quite a good moment to move because it's a moment where the west is already thrown off balance by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSo It cuts both ways. I do think the response that Britain, Europe, United States have brought to Ukraine Has been an important deterrent against Xi Jinping's actions, but it also will suggest to him that we are economically in a very difficult situation, and it'll be quite difficult, he will feel, To say to our voters who are already facing this unbelievable inflation and energy costs that we're going to take sanctions and counter sanctions over Taiwan, which would be 10, 20 times worse than anything we've seen to date.\n\nSpeaker 0: Alright, Roy. Let's go for a break.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome back to the Restless Politics question time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now bringing it home again, this goes back to something we discussed last time, and I want to revisit this because I don't I don't think I I don't think I said what I really think. Okay. News 23 slash 5. In a recent episode, Rory was passionate about maintaining the UK's green belt in relation to constructing new homes, Yet he never seems to stop traveling, especially flying. How does he balance his position with his carbon footprint?\n\nLucien Lawrence, Rory said he wants to protect the green belt from housing and build Hire in London to reduce housing scarcity. How does he propose to the latter with such resistance to new development in both law and local nimbyism? And I if you remember, Roy, last time, you you I didn't realize that that being asked the question about the green belt, and I said I was broadly in favor. I don't think I I think I'd said that because I was just sort of Thinking aloud. I actually don't see how we are I think the green belt risks becoming a kind of totem that there has to be I agree with you.\n\nThere should be a broader Environmental strategy, environmental policy, but we are going to have to build more homes, and we are going to have to build them in places where currently we don't build. And I think we cannot forever, just say that because we've got this green belt thing, it's like some sort of sacrosanct totem that we can no no we can never touch in the future.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, that's very interesting. I'm I'm that's good good. We've got I'm on the other side of this because I think if If you give up on the green belts not just in London, but around our other cities, you will create exactly the kind of urban sprawl that you see in the United States, And we're not a large enough country to accommodate that. It will you can see so many parts of our country that are now really wrecked, and I think at a time when nature and biodiversity It's under huge threat in Britain.\n\nIt would be horrible to build over the green belt, and I think there's such potential to make it a much more biodiverse landscape. And I do think the real problem in London is our obsession on building, you know, low 2 storey houses which sprawl all the way out Metroland all the way out through West London. And I think freeing up planning, a brave government freed up planning that would allow people to double the size of their houses, Put a flat on top and rent it out?\n\nSpeaker 0: And and go down below?\n\nSpeaker 1: And go down below. But I think going up is the easiest thing. It can be done very easily, and there's some very good examples of it already happening in London.\n\nSpeaker 0: Did you see did you see, the the in in Tokyo, the the the Japanese now are paying people to leave Tokyo.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very interesting.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think do you think we might have to move eventually to a kinda new generation of of Milton Keynes type, developments? Well,\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, definitely, definitely Milton Keynes was actually in a way a real success and I think building really ambitious new towns is a way of dealing with it and thinking about what I would call Gentle density, which is building at 6, 7 stories, which is of course what makes the beauty of Paris, is a very well good way of thinking about it, not 40, 50 stories, Which actually in UK law, you need to have so much standoff around the base of them that they're not really worth doing, but going for the gentle density. Question for you, Chris Cartlidge. Why don't we have ministers with more industrial backgrounds? Eiji, surely the minister for transport should have some experience managing transport infrastructure. Same for other minister roles, question mark.\n\nSpeaker 0: But I think we're back to the thing about, you know, why don't why don't people from a far broader Network and Jean Paul will go into politics. I mean, I'm always struck when I do events with business, some of which I did with you last year, where when you get into sort of people asking questions, they will there's always a question about, you know, why does the quality of politicians seem to four and why have so few people who've from this background, that back background got into politics. And it's easy to blame politics as some kind of abstract, but I always say to these people, well, have Have any of you ever thought of going into politics? And, you know, sort of there's lots of uncomfortable shuffling in their seats, and occasionally, somebody might put their hand and say, well, I did think about it, but I didn't like the intrusion into my life or whatever it might be. So, you know, I I don't think it's impossible for people look, it's hard.\n\nIt's still hard to get into politics and that more people want to be MPs And there are places by a long, long chore. But I think that one of the you know, whoever's asking that question is right on one level That it'd be good if we had people from a a far broader range of professional backgrounds, but we're only going to get that if people from those backgrounds today. I am going to go in and make a difference.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the the other solution, of course, which I favor is is the much more radical one, which is to say that the problem is that you're Dragging your ministers out of this very limited pool. So Yeah. You know, the recent government's had about 303 120 MPs, of which they're trying to Find a 100 ministers, and most of these people on both sides are professional politicians who know very little about the rest of the world because they've been local counsellors and they've been local party members since university, And frankly, people with other kinds of jobs don't don't really go into politics, so the answer, of course, is to go to more of a US system where you Can appoint a cabinet that doesn't come from your MPs. I mean, I was always struck that when we had Philip Hammond and Michael Fallon and Gavin Williamson as defense secretaries, and these were people who'd taken zero interests in defense before they became Defense factories. I mean, there were people who I remember joking that they didn't know the difference between a a javelin and a tomahawk.\n\nAnd up against I know the difference.\n\nSpeaker 0: There there isn't there isn't an event in the Olympics for the Tomahawk.\n\nSpeaker 1: There we are. Beautiful. On the other side, you've got the US where they were sitting opposite Ash Carter, who was a defense academic or general Maitlis, who'd been the head of the US Marine Corps, You know, it's a very, very different situation. It's sort of unthinkable in the US system. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But, Roy, you're you're argue you're arguing for a totally different political system then because, You know, I don't think you can envisage a situation where you have an elected prime minister who then appoints cabinet ministers from wherever he or she wants and stick them in the House of Lords, which is now, I think, so discredited as a particular institution.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then that's what Gordon Brown did, isn't it? I mean, he that was his government of all talents. He tried to do that, didn't he?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. No. Well, there were 1 or 2 ministers, Adam West, the the naval guy, and you can see why there's a case for that. But if you feel that\n\nSpeaker 1: Mallett Brown in the foreign office Yeah. But they weren't Peter Mandelson.\n\nSpeaker 0: They weren't cabinet ministers.\n\nSpeaker 1: Peter Mandelson, he Put them in the cabinet? Put them in the Lords to get them in the cabinet?\n\nSpeaker 0: That's true. That's true. But so so but I'd say that was an exceptional rule. You're you're sort of saying the prime minister should have even more power to decide who they want around that that table and then less accountability to parliament.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'd I'd want, I'd want something much more. I'd want a separation between the To such a and the executive.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. You are you are arguing for a completely different political system.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. 100%.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now what about what about, this one, hot buzz? As Scotland would have celebrated 50 years in the EEC EU today, this is when the question was sent in, And many of their employee rights are about to go on a potential bonfire. Do you feel any empathy at all for those Scots who may now want a different future for themselves and their country because of Brexit. PS, happy New Year.\n\nSpeaker 1: PS, I I I do have sympathy. I I remain very I mean, I think 2 2 quick things. 1 is I think Scotland would have a tough time joining the European Union, and most of its trading relationships are, of course, within the United Kingdom, And it would then find itself facing significant barriers, trading with its biggest trading partner if it suddenly joined the EU single markets and customs union because it would find itself In some version of the situation which Germany now finds itself in, where German UK trade has collapsed over the last few years, I also think that, As we talked about when we discussed Kosovo and Montenegro joining the European Union, there are many countries, European Union, that are very, very unwilling To allow in countries that are separated from other countries because if you're Spain or indeed the 4 other countries that are currently blocking Montenegrin accession, They have strong internal reasons not to favor nationalisms in their own countries.\n\nSpeaker 0: By the way, did you see that the border was shut briefly in Kosovo\n\nSpeaker 1: Serbia. Very good. Yeah. No. I mean, I agree.\n\nIt's and and and that that's a prediction, I think, that sadly may may prove right that the The chance for conflict again on the European conflict.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I've triggered I've triggered Rory into predicting another war.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's it. I like predictors. Dilly dally, this links this. Make a controversial political prediction for 2023, and each suggest a forfeit for the other if they get it wrong.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't know if this is controversial, but a political prediction I will make, I can already see the beginnings of it the client journalists who are basically in the pocket of the the the worst prime minister in history, the the blonde one well, the blonde male one. And that is that Johnson will try to effect some sort of comeback. But I I I hope this is this is maybe wishful thinking, but I If there is any real respect for truth and parliamentary sovereignty that he claims to believe in, then I hope he will be thwarted by the Current, I believe, still ongoing inquiry into whether he lied to parliament, and that his career will be ended by that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Here's my political prediction. I think the Republican Party in Congress is gonna tear itself to shreds. There's a really interesting thing happening at the moment with the election speaker, Kevin McCarthy, where he's basically being blocked by 5 or 6 extreme right wing republicans. He's falling over backwards to try to pander to them, including saying he's gonna impeach the Homeland Security Secretary and set up new committees to overturn everything that was done to January 6th.\n\nHe's got Trump calling for him, and he still can't win them over. And it reminds me a lot of the way in which the right wing of the Tory party took over And destroyed any attempts by Theresa May to get a compromise on Brexit because one of the elements of it is that the rights of these parties Seems to hold the whip hand by refusing to compromise, and you find yourself in a very odd situation which is had the Democrats been willing To come across and actually a few moderate democrats vote for him, they could have marginalized this right wing group. But, of course, democrats are never gonna do that, and the Republican party will be dragged ever further to the right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now, Rory, we did say that part of the question which you're avoiding was what are the forfeits if you're wrong. I am going to suggest that if you're proved to be wrong Yep. What what what's the time limit? You this is your prediction for this year. Yeah?\n\nSpeaker 1: This year. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Okay. I'm going to suggest that the 4th of you should be the the the live event that we do closest to that time when this year ends. Yep. You have to end it playing the bagpipes, not me.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, jeez. Wow. Okay. That's very tough. Alright.\n\nOkay.\n\nSpeaker 0: So So that's a that's a good that's a good incentive for you to do a bit of practice.\n\nSpeaker 1: That really? Blimey. That's a big incentive to do a bit of practice. Wow. Okay.\n\nFull fit for you. If you are proven to be wrong, you have to go and give a speech at Eton.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, Well, I've been asked to do a speech at Eton many times, and maybe the new head teacher or is it do we still call him a headmaster? Headmaster. Headmaster. Headmaster, who, by the way, we are having on as a guest on the podcast one day. We are, Rory.\n\nI'm telling you not now. We're doing maybe we could do it. Maybe we could do that at Eton in front of all the boys.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Well, there we are. That's a possibility. But but that's your that's that's your forfeit. I was I was hoping you were gonna make me swim in the cold water.\n\nAnd\n\nSpeaker 0: Would you rather do that than play the bagpipes?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd I'd rather do that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Would you? Okay. No. And the the the thing I was the point I was gonna make is that the last time that I was invited to go and speak to, I said, I will do it as long as I can bring I can bring a TV crew with me. And they said, oh, we let's just let's just put it put it on hold for now.\n\nPut put\n\nSpeaker 1: it on hold for now. Good. Alright. Well, Alastair, thank you very much. It's been a jolly jolly 50th birthday party.\n\nThank you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, listen, Rory, as it is your birthday, the the other thing I I -As I am up in Scotland, we got a lot of questions about because I tweeted, going to see Charles Kennedy's grave and playing the bible. I always go every year where we're up there and play the lament that was played at his funeral. And, Heather, it it gets you always talk about, you know, Twitter being a horrible place, and and often it is. But this year, I had, like, I don't know. It's up to a 1000000 views and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of nice comments and people remembering Charles and and so forth.\n\nSo it's not always horrible, And I think that's because it's music. And the other thing I'm planning for this year, Rory Yep. I plan to I plan to try to to get you to become generally more musical. My musical highlight of the year so far yesterday, we have a friend of ours, Catherine McLeod, who you may know was a journalist, and then she worked for Alice O'Donnell. And we went to she was up staying with us, and we went to see, some of her friends yesterday.\n\nAnd 2 of them, Megan and Ewan, they are in a very, very Famous folk band called Brayback. And Mhmm. I'm they said that if I mentioned James Lindsay, their double bass player, He loves the podcast so much, he will probably have a heart attack. I don't want him to have a heart attack, but I want him to know that Meghan and Ewan Put on a special performance just for us yesterday. It was absolutely brilliant.\n\nAnd in that spirit, Rory, Yeah. Given the day that this is, if you just sit very tight, sit very, very tight Yeah. And I'll be back with you in a moment. Hold on.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Go on then. Sitting\n\nSpeaker 0: tight. How was that?\n\nSpeaker 1: It was really lovely, Alastair. Thank you very, very, very much.\n\nSpeaker 0: How do you think the drone sounded?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I see this is the problem. I'm not properly musical. I this is why I think I've got a weird relationship with Idra like my father. My father was very musical and believed I just wasn't making enough of an effort. But I do think it's not just a question of effort.\n\nI think there's something wrong with my ear.\n\nSpeaker 0: I played the pipes at a New Year's Eve thing down in Argyll, this little brewery called the Argyll Ales, And I was the only person you'd think the Scottish Highlands would be sort of crawling with people who play the bagpipes. I was the only one there who could play the bagpipes. They asked me to play, And it was freezing, freezing cold. And the the backpipes this sounds weird, but they hate changes in temperature. So the fact is, Roy, my drones were off there slightly because I didn't want to spend the the requisite 15 minutes tuning them up just so you could just so you could sit there They're waiting for me to play happy birthday.\n\nBut, anyway, I hope you have a lovely birthday, and, we'll speak again next week.\n\nSpeaker 1: Speak next week. Lots of",
