That's the rest is politics.com. Welcome to the 4th episode of the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Which have landed in your podcast feeds on Past feeds on the 6th anniversary of the Brexit referendum. What are you doing to celebrate the occasion, Alastair? Well, I am reading The New European, whose front page lists all the Brexit benefits in full. There's a blank white page. And then reading the 6 pages inside about all the things that we've got wrong. What about you? Well, one of the things I keep thinking about, obviously, obsessively, is that There were options for a better Brexit. I mean, I think that a customs union solution, Even the kind of backstop solution that Theresa May proposed would have been much, much easier for British businesses dealing with Europe And most importantly of all, would have avoided the problems that we're now facing around borders in the Irish Sea and the Irish border. Because by keeping us in a single customs territory, There wouldn't have been need for those customs checks. There might have had to be some checks, and the stuff that we need to talk about, phytosanitary checks, which I think is an Important things to try to get right. Let me say something to make you happy. Okay? If I had felt back in the day that the choice was not between the 2nd referendum and whatever Theresa May was proposing. But was between what Theresa May was proposing and what we now have, I would happily That's what Theresa May was proposing. Does that make you happy? It definitely makes me very happy. It it raises the question, though, because it it's an interesting point because one of the things that, Obviously, people like me were trying to do then is to say to people who were trashing Theresa May's deal And pushing for 2nd referendum. I was trying to say, you're not gonna get a 2nd referendum. What you're gonna do is you're gonna give power to the RG and end up with a much harder Brexit and Boris Johnson in power. But I never managed to convince anyone of that. Do you have you got any sense on why I couldn't convince him? Was it that our messaging was wrong or people weren't Just weren't ready to hear that message? I think that well, let me just take something out myself. I was I genuinely believed That it was a democratic thing to do to allow people to have a a vote on the final say that was I didn't buy the line that was anti democratic. It happened in plenty of other countries where people sort of say, well, here's the general principle. Now we've got the detail. Let's take a proper look. And I genuinely believed, and I I never made any bones about this, that that was the best way to stop Brexit. But So I think maybe we're back to the point we talked about lots is that people were very, very, very fixed entrenched positions. Now let's just leave Brexit now because people are gonna talk so much about this. I want to ask you, Rory, a very, very personal question. And this is a question that's come from Ruth Smith. Rory mentions in 2 of his books his sister Fiona, who I've met, who has Down syndrome. I'd love to know how his sister influenced him and his politics, and what changes in society he would like to see to improve the lives of people with Down syndrome. Well, I think that the first things that had a, obviously, huge influence on me, Fiona's just 4 years younger than me. She's my only full sister. I've got 2 older half sisters, but they're Much older than me before my father's 1st marriage. So I I grew up with Fiona. We shared a bunk bed. We shared a bedroom. And, it's it she is the most wonderful, loving sister to have, but she has Down syndrome. She Her life has changed dramatically, and part of that actually is a tribute to to all kinds of governments and what they've introduced. For example, she really learnt to write properly in her thirties, and that's something that people didn't predict would happen. There's been huge transformations in in life expectancy also with people with Down syndrome. I remember one of the most terrifying things when I was 8 or 9, it's a Very unpleasant boy at school trying to tell me that, you know, my sister wasn't gonna live very long, which I think was true, that the life expectancy was was bad in those days. I I'd also, having lived in other countries, say that there are so many things horribly wrong in Britain. I think we've talked about prisons. We've talked about the lack of support of people with addiction issues. We've talked about the scandal of our probation services, The scandal of the way we treat poor elderly people. But I do think that Britain has got much, much better in the way that it treats people like Fena and the support that we've received. Genuinely, we is extraordinary. And she has been helped to get a job and supported very well into that, and that gives her immense pride. She works in an old people's home as, as a waitress, and I think it it is wonderful. I think I'm I'm really proud of what it comes to. What what When you when we came to your house to to do the the one face to face episode we've recorded, and you and you and Fiona was around and very, Very kind of much part of everything that was going on and big character and so forth. Of course, your mother's there. You know, I don't to predict the demise of your mother. But how much of a worry is that when when I sense that Fiona is very not dependent on your mother, but That's an incredibly important relationship. It's a very, very important relationship as it was with my father. And and I think that that is something to think about, and I think we'll Find a way of of including Fiona in our own family. Mhmm. But she she is, as you say, she's she's extraordinary. And And in some ways, she's also been helped by modern technology. She she loves social media, although I sometimes worry a little bit about the kind of social media she's going on. She loves, Obviously, television. She loves music, as well as other things. I mean, she also loves animals and nature. One of the controversies though, which which has been something that we've had to go through, which is a policy question, is that in the past, when she was going for jobs, she could go for jobs, and she could go in below the minimum wage. Mhmm. And in the early days, I think the Scottish government made up the difference between the salaries. But now, for for good reasons, a quality campaigners campaign very hard to make sure that she gets the same wage as other people. Mhmm. But I do sometimes worry about that because it does mean that it's it's difficult. She's not quite as quick as other people working in the kitchen. She's not. And, therefore, I do worry sometimes that that may be an example. I'm gonna get in trouble saying this, but but having been trying to look for a job for her recently, she lost the job recently, That that it is it is a bit of a challenge convincing particularly small businesses to take on somebody if they could get somebody who's much quicker for the for the same wage. Well, I really enjoyed meeting her. I thought it was absolutely fantastic, and you should be very, very proud of her. Ian Petrocelli, Rory, If you could be number 2 to any world leader over the ages, who might that be? In my case, definitely Alexander the Great, which gives me a chance to give it back to you. I would say Lincoln. Lincoln? Now what would it what would it what would it be like working for Lincoln? What's your sense of him as a man? I probably wouldn't be that good because, of course, he's a massive Pressing. I'm a massively present. Well, one one of my I think that's one of the reasons I really like him is that he achieved so much. I think his depression was way worse than mine. Everything I read about him, there was a wonderful quote from his law partner, William Harndon. I think I told you this before. He wrote a book about law Lincoln the lawyer, And he started it with the words, melancholy dripped from him with every step he took. But he just I just think to have achieved as much as he did in such difficult circumstances and to have managed so many curious and difficult relationships. See, I'd love to have watched him. Of all the people that we don't have film of, he's the one that I'd think, god, this is isn't he? And he's he's the one politician that it's very, very difficult not to admire in every way because he's admirable. Yes. Because in the end, what he did was morally extraordinary, which is event essentially, he emancipated, millions upon millions of people. But, of course, he was also somebody who had to deal with a very difficult political context in which he Changed his position on slavery. He had to manage a whole party, had to manage people through a bloody war. He did so with Oratory and. I mean, if you're looking for somebody to teach the ideal politician, it's so difficult to think of anyone better, isn't it? And also, Alexander the Great, If Boris Johnson's listening to our podcast, he'd assume that you're talking about him because it was not something. That's his that's his real name. I wanna wish to put on the record that That he is really not like Alexander the Great. No. It's not the Great. Be really depressed and appalled if he encountered him. Okay. Question 2 from Lewis. My question is to both Alastair and Rory. If you each had the whole world's attention for 30 seconds, what would you say, Alastair? Oh my god. 30 seconds. Right. I would say the world is a remarkable place That we've got so many massive, great, wonderful things happening for us, but we're kinda screwing it up. And I think part of the problem is our politics and populism, and I actually want young people to rise up against The older generations sweep them away and take control. That's what I'd say. It's beautiful. And that was in 3rd side 30 seconds. Blimey. All I can think of I was terrified by this question. All all all I was gonna offer if I had the world's attention for 30 seconds is that if you've lost something, It it's almost always where you thought it was. That is really good. So where do I think my asthma inhaler was? Because I can't find it. The answer, Anastasia, the answer I've I've I've think this is absolutely this is my greatest Philosophical insight. You always gotta go back and search really carefully in the place you've already searched, but didn't look in carefully enough. So Often what we do is we start by thinking, okay. I know where it is. We look there, but we don't quite look carefully enough, and then we move on too quickly. But I think mine was a little bit more elevated than yours. But another one. Another wait. Wait. I've got 1 more for 30 seconds. Right? Go ahead. If someone's got the hiccups, if you if you bet them Fifty quid. If they hiccup again, they stop hiccuping. No. I don't buy that. You You know, by the way, I can try not I'm gonna try that one here. Let me let me try let me let me try 1 on you. Okay. It's a grammatical thing. Is it correct to say the yolk of the egg is white, or is it the yolk of the egg are white? Well, the och of the egg is yellow. Well done. Thank you. Very good. Most people fall for it. Now listen, I want 1. You've asked you in a row. Nigel Engelbreau, I want your thoughts on the Banks Carol Cadwallader case, and why wasn't there more coverage of all the the meetings with Russians and the influence on Brexit, etcetera. Well, I think the first thing is, my aunt, I haven't been following the case closely, but she has been exonerated, hasn't she? Yeah. Which is a great tribute to an a journalist who took a huge risk and put an immense amount of energy into following this up. Is this something you've been following more closely? Tell us a little bit about it. I'll be following it very, very closely because my Fiona, the Fiona in my life, her brother Gavin was Carole Cadwalader's QC. And so and I've not been able to talk to him because Gavin, unlike Boris Johnson, is well above him and the worst attorney general in history. I've got a story about her, by the way. But, don't let me go without telling you it. But so Gavin is very, very proper, so So he doesn't talk to anybody outside, you know, the case. So I've been just sort of following it like an ordinary member of the public, Try offering sort of any moral support I can to Carol Cadwalader. And, yeah, there was so much kind of I mean, they, You know, not to put too fine a point to that. They they pretty much set out utterly to destroy her as an individual, not the papers she was writing for, but as an individual. And, I'm very, very, very, very, very, very pleased that she won. I I wanted to say one quick thing, Which I Are You? You you teased me last week's question time about the fact that you think I've been being chippy about your friend Tony Blair. And I must say since that, I've met him. And I I was I saw him twice last week, and I Incredible charm. Speaking you were speaking at his conference, aren't you? Speaking at his fitness conference. Incredibly, incredibly charmed. And one of the things that struck me about him, Despite all my grumbles about him, and I still got a lot lot of anger about this, him teaming up with Boris Johnson against the rest of the deal. He didn't team up. He didn't team up. Carry on. He did he said the speech, which he said I'm gonna form an I'm gonna form an unholy alliance of Boris Johnson. Anyway, I'm still angry about that. Anyway, the good thing, I was trying to get to the positive thing, is that unlike almost any other politician I've met, he remains much, much better at listening. So he'd said to me that there are Three great revolutions we gotta come to terms with, environmental rev revolution, technological revolution, Brexit. And I said, I think there's a fourth thing, which has actually changed with the invasion of Ukraine, which is the collapse of global trading system. Mhmm. Mhmm. And unlike almost any other politician I met, he took the idea. He played with it. He made it more interesting. He reconceptualized it. He threw it back at me, and I thought he was quite a class act. And, also, he I don't know whether he listens to the podcast. Obviously, he picked up on the fact that you and I have been rallying on this podcast. That's because I sent him Vasco's film, And he phoned me up and he said he said, what are you doing? He said, I told I told Roy that forget that whole calm, nice, polite thing. When he goes, he goes. He was so, honestly, you'd been defending him very, very strongly, but he he very sweetly also sympathized with me despite the fact that you were defending him as well. Yeah. I just want to return to Suellen Bravamen. I I when I was in Dublin last week, I bumped into on the way back, I bumped into a a QC who, does a lot of we talked about the treasury devil, who does the a list cases for the government. Suella Braverman, when she was a lawyer, before she became a sort of, you know, Holy politicized, the worst attorney general in history. She, she was a c list lawyer for for the attorney general. She was on the attorney general's c list, which meant she got the kind of lower order cases. And he said to me, she was hired twice by 2 separate departments, and she was never hired again by either. So there's Suella. I wanna give a shout out to Nicholas Webb because He was the guy who asked the question that I answered prematurely yesterday about the Welsh, elections. And the but then I want here's a good one for you, Rory, because you were sort of more into the agreeable disagreeing and all that stuff. Bernadette Trainor, she said, I've just been watching a video of you, I. E, me, Arguing, debating with Nigel Farage in 2019, and you actually seem quite amenable disposed towards each other, Is it possible to separate out the personal and the political? I I think it's it's It depends whether you think that somebody is fundamentally decent. I think if you think that somebody In the end, you can see the moral energy and force of them. I think you can separate it out. If you can't if the politics becomes and I think this is often the problem that I felt when I was a conservative MP debating with the left is that I think you've said it before that often The people I was debating with assumed that I was fundamentally evil. And in that case, you can't do it. Right. We'll take a quick break now and see you in a second. So welcome back to the rest of politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And we ask Campbell. Right. I'm beginning with a very grand question by Abby Innes. How does nonutopian politics win against utopian politics? Does even a party with an abundance of common sense, morality, and social purpose lose Against an ethically unhinged politics that promises the moon and abides by no rules. Well, it doesn't have to. It doesn't have to. When was the last Utopian? What's she trying to get at there? I think she's basically saying that that, I I think maybe Utopian's the wrong framing of it. I think that promising the moon is one Wonderful. But does she but does she mean but does she mean Boris Johnson, or does she mean Yes. She means sort of Boris Johnson. She means sort of Jeremy Corbyn. Or Jeremy Corbyn. I think she means populist, Gram statements and how difficult it is for the center ground. I think she's having a go at the idea that maybe the center ground is always doomed to fail and that people are more attracted by people who promise the moon and abide by no rules. Well, I I I think I think that is a sort of phase that we're definitely in at the moment, but I really do believe it will it will go back. And I and I want the the kind of the shots and the macrons and for all the setbacks. I want them to keep on with that sense of, look, let's try and keep politics serious and keep it rooted in the real world. But it's a it's a it's a tricky one. And I I no. I I also think we've talked about Keir Starmer a lot in the last couple of weeks. I mean, I do think he's got to to play to strengths. I mean, this thing about, you know, is he boring? Does he like charisma? I mean, you know, he's gotta turn it to his advantage. I do think people will be sick of this whole showmanship in politics, but I could be wrong. I could be wrong. I think Craig Brown, in your least favorite news pick, the Daily Mail, that she made a very, very good argument in favor of Keir Starmer essentially being boring and staying boring and saying that it's quite a welcome distraction. I talking to Twitter and and Abid's question, I I have also been thinking a little bit about this, the way in which Twitter encouraged its extremes. I was thinking about it last night because somebody had sent out a tweet which had been retweeted by lots of people I like, and it'd be shared 1500 times. And the person had said that, MPs had just got a 2,000 pound pay rise on their £80,000 salary. And little wonder there was an inflation when MPs were taking an over 20% pay rise. And, of course, £2,000 or £8,000 is not 20%. Right? It's it's just over 2%, not 20%, and yet it had been shared 1500 times. And I I had that thing which must I I guess a lot of people feel, which is given that this person is broadly speaking on my side And this is being liked by a lot of people. I like, do I come in now and say this is fake news? This is crazy. Right? You're pointing out you're claiming that MPs are taking a 20% pay rise There's not When they're not. And it's just not I think I think it would I think it would be a useful use of 2 seconds of your time to have done that. I do. Right. Here's a great question from Danny Platt. What is the most Unknown to the public, but most obvious to insider's thing about Downey Street. I'm going to go with the Queen's toilet. Go on. Tell us about Queen's toilet. There is a toilet in Downey Street. We have known it the Queen's toilet because it was put in there for the Queen. And it's called the Queen's toilet, and, I have to say there have been occasions when in a bit of a rush, I've nipped into the Queen's toilet. Is it does it have, like, gold taps and stuff? There is no there are no gold taps, but it's smarter than the other toilets. Noel Gallagher Confess that he went in there as well when we we gave him a tour of number 10 that we told him. Does does it look like a kind of show? When you you know, upstairs from the cabinet Yep. Room. Right? Upstairs from the cabinet room, there's some very nice pictures. I don't know what pictures Johnson's got, but there was a very nice picture. And there's a little thing when you come out of the green room. There's, like, 3 steps down. Yep. And it's and it's just on the right. Goodness. Yeah. Goodness. And is there a sign up saying only for her majesty the queen? No. And I don't think the queen ever used it because, of course, you know, just there in case she needed it. But, you know, the queen being the queen, she probably deals with all that stuff before she goes anywhere, doesn't she? Yeah. I suspect so. I suspect so. Alright. Judith Naylor, question 5. Do top politicians' leaders normally have some expert body language coaching To help get their message across. I think some do. I think they'll look at it. I remember once In opposition, Tony, we did a bit of a thing with him about how to stand, how to he and he didn't really go for it. He just thought this is sort of nonsense. But some do. And I you look. But how people I think after this TV program I'm doing, I was telling them the other day. I may have told you this before, but this is about the TV program. We don't know about TV program. Tell us how you It's called it's called make me prime minister, and it's, it's Saida Warsi, who you will know from your cabinet days. She and I are Putting 12 members of the public through their paces, they all think they can be prime minister. And it's quite interesting to I'm not allowed to say too much, but it's very, very interesting. And by the way, they did we do bring in experts for certain sessions. So if you the next time you're in the country, if you wanna come and have a look and you can be you can be an expert. No. I'm serious. We had, we've had all sorts of some of your friends down there. But it's like no. I I think that I was telling them that there was this experiment in America where they showed 2 sets of have I told you this? About 2 sets of a 100 pictures To a random selection of peep Thomas. No. And they basically said, these are 2 sets. Each each pairing has taken part in an election which has already happened. Who do you think who do you think won? Yep. They got 92% right. Oh. Wow. Based on what terrifying. Yes. That's very fine. So so what one of the answers, I think one of the big differences, though, between UK and US politics is that very few British politicians would do things like body language coaching. We're pretty sort of scruffy and informal. And partly, we don't have the kind of money in our politics to pay for that unless you're a party leader. It's quite expensive. But but John Johnson does the reverse, doesn't he? He does this sort of, I'm actually quite smart. I'm going to make myself look really scruffy. What's that about? Well, I think that's deeply appealing to people. I think people like the scent. I think part of his voters say, well, it's quite nice. You know? I don't really shave. I don't really brush my hair. I'm getting a bit fat. I don't tuck my shirt in. Maybe I could be prime minister. I tell you that I can spot those politicians who, You know, when you see them sort of suddenly doing jerky hand movements and this, like, somebody's told them, you know, pointing is really shows strength and Opening your hands shows. There's something in that, but it's gotta look natural. My the best the Clinton was brilliant. Clinton was brilliant at body language. I I always felt when I took, when I was the chair of the defense committee and when I was in the foreign affairs committee going to Washington, the amazing contrast Between American and British politicians. The the the security guards at congress and senate couldn't actually believe we were politicians because all American politicians So, like, these incredibly tall. They all wear striped red ties, you know, white shirts. Yeah. They all have to be over 6 foot tall, and we all turned up. And we basically you know, we're all sort of 5 foot 6, 5 foot 8, A bit tubby, a bit disheveled, and and, literally, the security guards couldn't be convinced that we could possibly be members of parliament. What, do you remember that period where we kept having Tories? The most dramatic was Sajid Javid, but I think Johnson, Hancock, Raab, All doing that legs apart stance thing. Hey. Remember? Yeah. The power starts. They all looked ridiculous. Yeah. That was really weird. That was a very strange do you remember what it was? It essentially, their legs Far too wide apart, they stand in a weird a shape. And I'll tell you the other thing. John Johnson does this thing with his tie sort of down below his groin. Sorry. The talk of Johnson's groin, I the my earpiece fell out. The tie below his groin and his legs, particularly, I've noticed this when he's being interviewed by women with his legs so far apart. He's like a sumo wrestler. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's that about? Yeah. Well, I think he must, at some point in his youth, decided this was somehow attractive, but it's not. Last question. Hugh, this is a pretty serious one, but maybe a good one to finish on. Given the climate crisis is an existential threat to global stability, why do you not talk about it on your podcast? Oh, Well, we do. We have talked about the climate crisis, but but in a sort of we've talked about it we talked about it, I guess, in relation to The whole, you know, us traveling so much, and maybe we haven't addressed it. Maybe we should, as future point, do a whole thing on the climate crisis. I do think, by the way, One thing I was going to raise, when I now will raise it because you've raised that question, I was going to raise this yesterday. Are you aware, and I bet most of our listeners are, There was an there was a meeting of the of the cop in Bonn last week. And now if you remember, when Glasgow happened, Every nobody was talking about anything else, and all these great promises were made. And and the bomb meeting, apparently, was incredibly bad tempered. Yep. It was the poor countries telling the rich countries, you're all just words. Yep. And because of Ukraine and because of all the other stuff happening, It's just vanished, and that is very, very, very wild. And it's happening very quickly. So you're completely right. And we're looking at it. So there's horrifying floods in Bangladesh, some of the worst ever. Somalia is going about to go into its 5th year of drought with millions of people, starving. And we're into a very, very complicated world where Suddenly, people are beginning to sense because of Ukraine, because of the problems on oil and gas, because of the food shortages. They're beginning to see much more directly the kind of sacrifices that will be involved and the politics that will be involved in doing the transition in a way that we didn't Probably just just a year ago, I I remember when I was running for London mayor, the head of the taxi drivers union, saying to me, I can tell you how you're gonna you can win this election. I guarantee it. All you've gotta do is go to Outer London and point out to people that Sadiq Khan, if they vote from him, is gonna cost them 60 £5 a week to drive their car because of the congestion charge, and you'll win it. Now, of course, I didn't do it because I agreed with him on on what he was trying to do on tailpipes emissions and carbon emissions. But it was a sudden reminder that we haven't begun to see the politics of opposition yet because we haven't really begun to take the real costs that will be involved in the transition for 2035, 2040. Very quick one on the strikes. Martin Edwards, why did the RMT choose this week of all weeks with the 2 by elections to have their strikes? Sure. It just means it's surely, it just means that Starmer is caught in double crosshairs. I think it shows actually the trade unions don't necessarily just see themselves as being about the Labour Party. So so that's that. Can I give a final final shout out, Rory, to somebody called Robert Goodall? Go on then. He actually he actually came to the recording of one of these episodes of to this TV program. And he says, were you very impressed when I told you that I managed to get into both of your live shows with Rory Stewart? I I think we were impressed by that, weren't we? Very, very, very impressed. Thank you all very much. Robert. Well done, and see everybody again next week. Thank Thank you. All the best.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to the 4th episode of the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which have landed in your podcast feeds on Past feeds on the 6th anniversary of the Brexit referendum. What are you doing to celebrate the occasion, Alastair?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I am reading The New European, whose front page lists all the Brexit benefits in full. There's a blank white page. And then reading the 6 pages inside about all the things that we've got wrong. What about you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, one of the things I keep thinking about, obviously, obsessively, is that There were options for a better Brexit. I mean, I think that a customs union solution, Even the kind of backstop solution that Theresa May proposed would have been much, much easier for British businesses dealing with Europe And most importantly of all, would have avoided the problems that we're now facing around borders in the Irish Sea and the Irish border. Because by keeping us in a single customs territory, There wouldn't have been need for those customs checks. There might have had to be some checks, and the stuff that we need to talk about, phytosanitary checks, which I think is an Important things to try to get right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let me say something to make you happy. Okay? If I had felt back in the day that the choice was not between the 2nd referendum and whatever Theresa May was proposing. But was between what Theresa May was proposing and what we now have, I would happily That's what Theresa May was proposing. Does that make you happy?\n\nSpeaker 1: It definitely makes me very happy. It it raises the question, though, because it it's an interesting point because one of the things that, Obviously, people like me were trying to do then is to say to people who were trashing Theresa May's deal And pushing for 2nd referendum. I was trying to say, you're not gonna get a 2nd referendum. What you're gonna do is you're gonna give power to the RG and end up with a much harder Brexit and Boris Johnson in power. But I never managed to convince anyone of that.\n\nDo you have you got any sense on why I couldn't convince him? Was it that our messaging was wrong or people weren't Just weren't ready to hear that message?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think that well, let me just take something out myself. I was I genuinely believed That it was a democratic thing to do to allow people to have a a vote on the final say that was I didn't buy the line that was anti democratic. It happened in plenty of other countries where people sort of say, well, here's the general principle. Now we've got the detail. Let's take a proper look.\n\nAnd I genuinely believed, and I I never made any bones about this, that that was the best way to stop Brexit. But So I think maybe we're back to the point we talked about lots is that people were very, very, very fixed entrenched positions. Now let's just leave Brexit now because people are gonna talk so much about this. I want to ask you, Rory, a very, very personal question. And this is a question that's come from Ruth Smith.\n\nRory mentions in 2 of his books his sister Fiona, who I've met, who has Down syndrome. I'd love to know how his sister influenced him and his politics, and what changes in society he would like to see to improve the lives of people with Down syndrome.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think that the first things that had a, obviously, huge influence on me, Fiona's just 4 years younger than me. She's my only full sister. I've got 2 older half sisters, but they're Much older than me before my father's 1st marriage. So I I grew up with Fiona. We shared a bunk bed.\n\nWe shared a bedroom. And, it's it she is the most wonderful, loving sister to have, but she has Down syndrome. She Her life has changed dramatically, and part of that actually is a tribute to to all kinds of governments and what they've introduced. For example, she really learnt to write properly in her thirties, and that's something that people didn't predict would happen. There's been huge transformations in in life expectancy also with people with Down syndrome.\n\nI remember one of the most terrifying things when I was 8 or 9, it's a Very unpleasant boy at school trying to tell me that, you know, my sister wasn't gonna live very long, which I think was true, that the life expectancy was was bad in those days. I I'd also, having lived in other countries, say that there are so many things horribly wrong in Britain. I think we've talked about prisons. We've talked about the lack of support of people with addiction issues. We've talked about the scandal of our probation services, The scandal of the way we treat poor elderly people.\n\nBut I do think that Britain has got much, much better in the way that it treats people like Fena and the support that we've received. Genuinely, we is extraordinary. And she has been helped to get a job and supported very well into that, and that gives her immense pride. She works in an old people's home as, as a waitress, and I think it it is wonderful. I think I'm I'm really proud of what it comes to.\n\nSpeaker 0: What what When you when we came to your house to to do the the one face to face episode we've recorded, and you and you and Fiona was around and very, Very kind of much part of everything that was going on and big character and so forth. Of course, your mother's there. You know, I don't to predict the demise of your mother. But how much of a worry is that when when I sense that Fiona is very not dependent on your mother, but That's an incredibly important relationship.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a very, very important relationship as it was with my father. And and I think that that is something to think about, and I think we'll Find a way of of including Fiona in our own family. Mhmm. But she she is, as you say, she's she's extraordinary. And And in some ways, she's also been helped by modern technology.\n\nShe she loves social media, although I sometimes worry a little bit about the kind of social media she's going on. She loves, Obviously, television. She loves music, as well as other things. I mean, she also loves animals and nature. One of the controversies though, which which has been something that we've had to go through, which is a policy question, is that in the past, when she was going for jobs, she could go for jobs, and she could go in below the minimum wage.\n\nMhmm. And in the early days, I think the Scottish government made up the difference between the salaries. But now, for for good reasons, a quality campaigners campaign very hard to make sure that she gets the same wage as other people. Mhmm. But I do sometimes worry about that because it does mean that it's it's difficult.\n\nShe's not quite as quick as other people working in the kitchen. She's not. And, therefore, I do worry sometimes that that may be an example. I'm gonna get in trouble saying this, but but having been trying to look for a job for her recently, she lost the job recently, That that it is it is a bit of a challenge convincing particularly small businesses to take on somebody if they could get somebody who's much quicker for the for the same wage.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I really enjoyed meeting her. I thought it was absolutely fantastic, and you should be very, very proud of her. Ian Petrocelli, Rory, If you could be number 2 to any world leader over the ages, who might that be?\n\nSpeaker 1: In my case, definitely Alexander the Great, which gives me a chance to give it back to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: I would say Lincoln.\n\nSpeaker 1: Lincoln? Now what would it what would it what would it be like working for Lincoln? What's your sense of him as a man?\n\nSpeaker 0: I probably wouldn't be that good because, of course, he's a massive Pressing. I'm a massively present. Well, one one of my I think that's one of the reasons I really like him is that he achieved so much. I think his depression was way worse than mine. Everything I read about him, there was a wonderful quote from his law partner, William Harndon.\n\nI think I told you this before. He wrote a book about law Lincoln the lawyer, And he started it with the words, melancholy dripped from him with every step he took. But he just I just think to have achieved as much as he did in such difficult circumstances and to have managed so many curious and difficult relationships. See, I'd love to have watched him. Of all the people that we don't have film of, he's the one that I'd think,\n\nSpeaker 1: god, this is isn't he? And he's he's the one politician that it's very, very difficult not to admire in every way because he's admirable. Yes. Because in the end, what he did was morally extraordinary, which is event essentially, he emancipated, millions upon millions of people. But, of course, he was also somebody who had to deal with a very difficult political context in which he Changed his position on slavery.\n\nHe had to manage a whole party, had to manage people through a bloody war. He did so with Oratory and. I mean, if you're looking for somebody to teach the ideal politician, it's so difficult to think of anyone better, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: And also, Alexander the Great, If Boris Johnson's listening to our podcast, he'd assume that you're talking about him because it was not something. That's his that's his real name.\n\nSpeaker 1: I wanna wish to put on the record that That he is really not like Alexander the Great. No. It's not the Great. Be really depressed and appalled if he encountered him. Okay.\n\nQuestion 2 from Lewis. My question is to both Alastair and Rory. If you each had the whole world's attention for 30 seconds, what would you say, Alastair?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh my god. 30 seconds. Right. I would say the world is a remarkable place That we've got so many massive, great, wonderful things happening for us, but we're kinda screwing it up. And I think part of the problem is our politics and populism, and I actually want young people to rise up against The older generations sweep them away and take control.\n\nThat's what I'd say.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's beautiful. And that was in 3rd side 30 seconds. Blimey. All I can think of I was terrified by this question. All all all I was gonna offer if I had the world's attention for 30 seconds is that if you've lost something, It it's almost always where you thought it was.\n\nSpeaker 0: That is really good. So where do I think my asthma inhaler was? Because I can't find it.\n\nSpeaker 1: The answer, Anastasia, the answer I've I've I've think this is absolutely this is my greatest Philosophical insight. You always gotta go back and search really carefully in the place you've already searched, but didn't look in carefully enough. So Often what we do is we start by thinking, okay. I know where it is. We look there, but we don't quite look carefully enough, and then we move on too quickly.\n\nBut I\n\nSpeaker 0: think mine was a little bit more elevated than yours.\n\nSpeaker 1: But another one. Another wait. Wait. I've got 1 more for 30 seconds. Right?\n\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead.\n\nSpeaker 1: If someone's got the hiccups, if you if you bet them Fifty quid. If they hiccup again, they stop hiccuping.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I don't buy that.\n\nSpeaker 1: You You know, by the way, I can\n\nSpeaker 0: try not\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna try that one here.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let me let me try let me let me try 1 on you. Okay. It's a grammatical thing. Is it correct to say the yolk of the egg is white, or is it the yolk of the egg are white?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the och of the egg is yellow.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well done. Thank you. Very good. Most people fall for it. Now listen, I want 1.\n\nYou've asked you in a row. Nigel Engelbreau, I want your thoughts on the Banks Carol Cadwallader case, and why wasn't there more coverage of all the the meetings with Russians and the influence on Brexit, etcetera.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think the first thing is, my aunt, I haven't been following the case closely, but she has been exonerated, hasn't she? Yeah. Which is a great tribute to an a journalist who took a huge risk and put an immense amount of energy into following this up. Is this something you've been following more closely? Tell us a little bit about it.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'll be following it very, very closely because my Fiona, the Fiona in my life, her brother Gavin was Carole Cadwalader's QC. And so and I've not been able to talk to him because Gavin, unlike Boris Johnson, is well above him and the worst attorney general in history. I've got a story about her, by the way. But, don't let me go without telling you it. But so Gavin is very, very proper, so So he doesn't talk to anybody outside, you know, the case.\n\nSo I've been just sort of following it like an ordinary member of the public, Try offering sort of any moral support I can to Carol Cadwalader. And, yeah, there was so much kind of I mean, they, You know, not to put too fine a point to that. They they pretty much set out utterly to destroy her as an individual, not the papers she was writing for, but as an individual. And, I'm very, very, very, very, very, very pleased that she won.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I wanted to say one quick thing, Which I Are You? You you teased me last week's question time about\n\nSpeaker 0: the fact\n\nSpeaker 1: that you think I've been being chippy about your friend Tony Blair. And I must say since that, I've met him. And I I was I saw him twice last week, and I\n\nSpeaker 0: Incredible charm. Speaking you were speaking at his conference, aren't you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Speaking at his fitness conference. Incredibly, incredibly charmed. And one of the things that struck me about him, Despite all my grumbles about him, and I still got a lot lot of anger about this, him teaming up with Boris Johnson against the rest of the deal.\n\nSpeaker 0: He didn't team up. He didn't team up. Carry on. He did\n\nSpeaker 1: he said the speech, which he said I'm gonna form an I'm gonna form an unholy alliance of Boris Johnson. Anyway, I'm still angry about that. Anyway, the good thing, I was trying to get to the positive thing, is that unlike almost any other politician I've met, he remains much, much better at listening. So he'd said to me that there are Three great revolutions we gotta come to terms with, environmental rev revolution, technological revolution, Brexit. And I said, I think there's a fourth thing, which has actually changed with the invasion of Ukraine, which is the collapse of global trading system.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And unlike almost any other politician I met, he took the idea. He played with it. He made it more interesting. He reconceptualized it. He threw it back at me, and I thought he was quite a class act.\n\nAnd, also, he I don't know whether he listens to the podcast. Obviously, he picked up on the fact that you and I have been rallying on this podcast.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's because I sent him Vasco's film, And he phoned me up and he said he said, what are you doing? He said, I told I told Roy that forget that whole calm, nice, polite thing. When he goes, he goes.\n\nSpeaker 1: He was so, honestly, you'd been defending him very, very strongly, but he he very sweetly also sympathized with me despite the fact that you were defending him as well.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I just want to return to Suellen Bravamen. I I when I was in Dublin last week, I bumped into on the way back, I bumped into a a QC who, does a lot of we talked about the treasury devil, who does the a list cases for the government. Suella Braverman, when she was a lawyer, before she became a sort of, you know, Holy politicized, the worst attorney general in history. She, she was a c list lawyer for for the attorney general.\n\nShe was on the attorney general's c list, which meant she got the kind of lower order cases. And he said to me, she was hired twice by 2 separate departments, and she was never hired again by either. So there's Suella. I wanna give a shout out to Nicholas Webb because He was the guy who asked the question that I answered prematurely yesterday about the Welsh, elections. And the but then I want here's a good one for you, Rory, because you were sort of more into the agreeable disagreeing and all that stuff.\n\nBernadette Trainor, she said, I've just been watching a video of you, I. E, me, Arguing, debating with Nigel Farage in 2019, and you actually seem quite amenable disposed towards each other, Is it possible to separate out the personal and the political?\n\nSpeaker 1: I I think it's it's It depends whether you think that somebody is fundamentally decent. I think if you think that somebody In the end, you can see the moral energy and force of them. I think you can separate it out. If you can't if the politics becomes and I think this is often the problem that I felt when I was a conservative MP debating with the left is that I think you've said it before that often The people I was debating with assumed that I was fundamentally evil. And in that case, you can't do it.\n\nRight. We'll take a quick break now and see you in a second. So welcome back to the rest of politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we ask Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right. I'm beginning with a very grand question by Abby Innes. How does nonutopian politics win against utopian politics? Does even a party with an abundance of common sense, morality, and social purpose lose Against an ethically unhinged politics that promises the moon and abides by no rules.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, it doesn't have to. It doesn't have to. When was the last Utopian? What's she trying to get at there?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think she's basically saying that that, I I think maybe Utopian's the wrong framing of it. I think that promising the moon is one Wonderful.\n\nSpeaker 0: But does she but does she mean but does she mean Boris Johnson, or does she mean Yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: She means sort of Boris Johnson. She means sort\n\nSpeaker 0: of Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or Jeremy Corbyn. I think she means populist, Gram statements and how difficult it is for the center ground. I think she's having a go at the idea that maybe the center ground is always doomed to fail and that people are more attracted by people who promise the moon and abide by no rules.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I I think I think that is a sort of phase that we're definitely in at the moment, but I really do believe it will it will go back. And I and I want the the kind of the shots and the macrons and for all the setbacks. I want them to keep on with that sense of, look, let's try and keep politics serious and keep it rooted in the real world. But it's a it's a it's a tricky one. And I I no.\n\nI I also think we've talked about Keir Starmer a lot in the last couple of weeks. I mean, I do think he's got to to play to strengths. I mean, this thing about, you know, is he boring? Does he like charisma? I mean, you know, he's gotta turn it to his advantage.\n\nI do think people will be sick of this whole showmanship in politics, but I could be wrong. I could be wrong.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think Craig Brown, in your least favorite news pick, the Daily Mail, that she made a very, very good argument in favor of Keir Starmer essentially being boring and staying boring and saying that it's quite a welcome distraction. I talking to Twitter and and Abid's question, I I have also been thinking a little bit about this, the way in which Twitter encouraged its extremes. I was thinking about it last night because somebody had sent out a tweet which had been retweeted by lots of people I like, and it'd be shared 1500 times. And the person had said that, MPs had just got a 2,000 pound pay rise on their £80,000 salary. And little wonder there was an inflation when MPs were taking an over 20% pay rise.\n\nAnd, of course, £2,000 or £8,000 is not 20%. Right? It's it's just over 2%, not 20%, and yet it had been shared 1500 times. And I I had that thing which must I I guess a lot of people feel, which is given that this person is broadly speaking on my side And this is being liked by a lot of people. I like, do I come in now and say this is fake news?\n\nThis is crazy. Right? You're pointing out you're claiming that MPs are taking a 20% pay rise\n\nSpeaker 0: There's not When\n\nSpeaker 1: they're not. And it's just not I think\n\nSpeaker 0: I think it would I think it would be a useful use of 2 seconds of your time to have done that. I do. Right. Here's a great question from Danny Platt. What is the most Unknown to the public, but most obvious to insider's thing about Downey Street.\n\nI'm going to go with the Queen's toilet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Go on. Tell us about Queen's toilet.\n\nSpeaker 0: There is a toilet in Downey Street. We have known it the Queen's toilet because it was put in there for the Queen. And it's called the Queen's toilet, and, I have to say there have been occasions when in a bit of a rush, I've nipped into the Queen's toilet.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is it does it have, like, gold taps and stuff?\n\nSpeaker 0: There is no there are no gold taps, but it's smarter than the other toilets. Noel Gallagher Confess that he went in there as well when we we gave him a tour of number 10\n\nSpeaker 1: that we told him. Does does it look like a kind\n\nSpeaker 0: of show? When you you know, upstairs from the cabinet Yep. Room. Right? Upstairs from the cabinet room, there's some very nice pictures.\n\nI don't know what pictures Johnson's got, but there was a very nice picture. And there's a little thing when you come out of the green room. There's, like, 3 steps down. Yep. And it's and it's just on the right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Goodness. Yeah. Goodness. And is there a sign up saying only for her majesty the queen?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. And I don't think the queen ever used it because, of course, you know, just there in case she needed it. But, you know, the queen being the queen, she probably deals with all that stuff before she goes anywhere, doesn't she?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I suspect so. I suspect so. Alright. Judith Naylor, question 5.\n\nDo top politicians' leaders normally have some expert body language coaching To help get their message across.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think some do. I think they'll look at it. I remember once In opposition, Tony, we did a bit of a thing with him about how to stand, how to he and he didn't really go for it. He just thought this is sort of nonsense. But some do.\n\nAnd I you look. But how people I think after this TV program I'm doing, I was telling them the other day. I may have told you this before, but this is\n\nSpeaker 1: about the TV program. We don't know about TV program. Tell us how you\n\nSpeaker 0: It's called it's called make me prime minister, and it's, it's Saida Warsi, who you will know from your cabinet days. She and I are Putting 12 members of the public through their paces, they all think they can be prime minister. And it's quite interesting to I'm not allowed to say too much, but it's very, very interesting. And by the way, they did we do bring in experts for certain sessions. So if you the next time you're in the country, if you wanna come and have a look and you can be you can be an expert.\n\nNo. I'm serious. We had, we've had all sorts of some of your friends down there. But it's like no. I I think that I was telling them that there was this experiment in America where they showed 2 sets of have I told you this?\n\nAbout 2 sets of a 100 pictures To a random selection of peep\n\nSpeaker 1: Thomas. No.\n\nSpeaker 0: And they basically said, these are 2 sets. Each each pairing has taken part in an election which has already happened. Who do you think who do you think won? Yep. They got 92% right.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh. Wow.\n\nSpeaker 0: Based on what terrifying.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. That's very fine. So so what one of the answers, I think one of the big differences, though, between UK and US politics is that very few British politicians would do things like body language coaching. We're pretty sort of scruffy and informal. And partly, we don't have the kind of money in our politics to pay for that unless you're a party leader.\n\nIt's quite expensive.\n\nSpeaker 0: But but John Johnson does the reverse, doesn't he? He does this sort of, I'm actually quite smart. I'm going to make myself look really scruffy. What's that about?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think that's deeply appealing to people. I think people like the scent. I think part of his voters say, well, it's quite nice. You know? I don't really shave.\n\nI don't really brush my hair. I'm getting a bit fat. I don't tuck my shirt in. Maybe I could be prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 0: I tell you that I can spot those politicians who, You know, when you see them sort of suddenly doing jerky hand movements and this, like, somebody's told them, you know, pointing is really shows strength and Opening your hands shows. There's something in that, but it's gotta look natural. My the best the Clinton was brilliant. Clinton was brilliant at body language.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I always felt when I took, when I was the chair of the defense committee and when I was in the foreign affairs committee going to Washington, the amazing contrast Between American and British politicians. The the the security guards at congress and senate couldn't actually believe we were politicians because all American politicians So, like, these incredibly tall. They all wear\n\nSpeaker 0: striped red\n\nSpeaker 1: ties, you know, white shirts. Yeah. They all have to be over 6 foot tall, and we all turned up. And we basically you know, we're all sort of 5 foot 6, 5 foot 8, A bit tubby, a bit disheveled, and and, literally, the security guards couldn't be convinced that we could possibly be members of parliament.\n\nSpeaker 0: What, do you remember that period where we kept having Tories? The most dramatic was Sajid Javid, but I think Johnson, Hancock, Raab, All doing that legs apart stance thing. Hey. Remember?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. The power starts.\n\nSpeaker 0: They all looked ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That was really weird. That was a very strange do you remember what it was? It essentially, their legs Far too wide apart, they stand in a weird a shape.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I'll tell you the other thing. John Johnson does this thing with his tie sort of down below his groin. Sorry. The talk of Johnson's groin, I the my earpiece fell out. The tie below his groin and his legs, particularly, I've noticed this when he's being interviewed by women with his legs so far apart.\n\nHe's like a sumo wrestler. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's it's that about? Yeah. Well, I think he must, at some point in his youth, decided this was somehow attractive, but it's not. Last question.\n\nHugh, this is a pretty serious one, but maybe a good one to finish on. Given the climate crisis is an existential threat to global stability, why do you not talk about it on your podcast?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, Well, we do. We have talked about the climate crisis, but but in a sort of we've talked about it we talked about it, I guess, in relation to The whole, you know, us traveling so much, and maybe we haven't addressed it. Maybe we should, as future point, do a whole thing on the climate crisis. I do think, by the way, One thing I was going to raise, when I now will raise it because you've raised that question, I was going to raise this yesterday. Are you aware, and I bet most of our listeners are, There was an there was a meeting of the of the cop in Bonn last week.\n\nAnd now if you remember, when Glasgow happened, Every nobody was talking about anything else, and all these great promises were made. And and the bomb meeting, apparently, was incredibly bad tempered. Yep. It was the poor countries telling the rich countries, you're all just words. Yep.\n\nAnd because of Ukraine and because of all the other stuff happening, It's just vanished, and that is very, very, very wild.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's happening very quickly. So you're completely right. And we're looking at it. So there's horrifying floods in Bangladesh, some of the worst ever. Somalia is going about to go into its 5th year of drought with millions of people, starving.\n\nAnd we're into a very, very complicated world where Suddenly, people are beginning to sense because of Ukraine, because of the problems on oil and gas, because of the food shortages. They're beginning to see much more directly the kind of sacrifices that will be involved and the politics that will be involved in doing the transition in a way that we didn't Probably just just a year ago, I I remember when I was running for London mayor, the head of the taxi drivers union, saying to me, I can tell you how you're gonna you can win this election. I guarantee it. All you've gotta do is go to Outer London and point out to people that Sadiq Khan, if they vote from him, is gonna cost them 60 £5 a week to drive their car because of the congestion charge, and you'll win it. Now, of course, I didn't do it because I agreed with him on on what he was trying to do on tailpipes emissions and carbon emissions.\n\nBut it was a sudden reminder that we haven't begun to see the politics of opposition yet because we haven't really begun to take the real costs that will be involved in the transition for 2035, 2040.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very quick one on the strikes. Martin Edwards, why did the RMT choose this week of all weeks with the 2 by elections to have their strikes? Sure. It just means it's surely, it just means that Starmer is caught in double crosshairs. I think it shows actually the trade unions don't necessarily just see themselves as being about the Labour Party.\n\nSo so that's that. Can I give a final final shout out, Rory, to somebody called Robert Goodall?\n\nSpeaker 1: Go on then.\n\nSpeaker 0: He actually he actually came to the recording of one of these episodes of to this TV program. And he says, were you very impressed when I told you that I managed to get into both of your live shows with Rory Stewart?\n\nSpeaker 1: I I\n\nSpeaker 0: think we were impressed by that, weren't we?\n\nSpeaker 1: Very, very, very impressed. Thank you all very much. Robert. Well done, and see everybody again next week.\n\nSpeaker 0: Thank Thank you. All the best.",
