Hi there. It's me, Alastair Campbell. Welcome to The Rest is Politics. Today, I want to introduce you to our exciting new podcast, Leading. Rory and I have decided to set up a dedicated interview feed and differentiate it from The Rest is Politics, the main podcast, because, crucially, not all the interviews we're going to do will be with politicians. Every Monday, we're gonna try and speak to people who are leading in their field or have led or could lead or might lead or want to lead. Could be presidents, policymakers, Sports stars, religious leaders, we're going to be hosting some of the best and biggest names from many, many different walks of life. And we were both thrilled with our 1st guest for leading Former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine still looking and sounding pretty good at 89 years of age. One of the biggest names in the history of British politics, Michael Heseltine discusses everything from his crucial role in the rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher, his current position in the House of Lords, and his current very interesting views on politics. So here is a quick preview from Leading with Michael Heseltine out right now. To hear the rest, just search leading wherever you get your podcasts. But for now, enjoy this sneak peek. When Margaret Thatcher died, how did you feel? What did what was your assessment of her life and and legacy and and her role in your life. We had, as colleagues, a a a very good relationship. I mean, that doesn't mean to say we liked each other or were friends. That that that's ridiculous. That's not the nature of the relationships of people in business or universities or hospitals or politics. But You work alongside someone, with someone, and sometimes you work for somebody. And in my experience with Margaret, She knew what I believed, and it often coincided with what she believed. Indeed, in some in some curious ways, she tried to use me to change the process of government. There was a a disastrous evening. Because If you look at the number of ministers who actually ran their departments and ran them the way Margaret wanted, I come out top of the the queue. I mean, I closed down more Quangos, even than Keith Joseph, I beat him by 1. I ran down my department by 3% per annum, which was way ahead of what everyone else was doing. And Margaret looked at the techniques I was using and thought they were so impressive that she, invited me to give a, What frankly was a tutorial to the cabinet. It was a disaster. You can imagine. I mean, because it meant Really detailed draft And and the exploration of things like organograms and and, like, spreadsheets and you know? And you can imagine Quentin Hailsham and Willie Whitelaw sitting there being told by this extraordinary phenomenon from the Welsh valleys were not the valleys, but from Swansea. And there was a small businessman and all this telling us, you know, the great figures of historic. What would William Whitelaw have been like as prime minister? People thought that he had a good chance against mister Farage. Supported him, against Margaret. What what would he have been like as a prime minister? Well, look. You you will never know because it's what you will never know is what people will be like under pressure. But I think he'd have been a a good prime minister. The the on the big the descending issue of, the trade union power, which was actually where 1979 pushed us. There was complete unity in the cabinet. Indeed, the extraordinary thing about Margaret's cabinet is it was Ted's cabinet given the 2nd chance, and that was invaluable because we were battle hardened and experienced, and we knew what we're gonna do. There was no dissent, and Willie would have Done it, in in the same way that we all did it. And and, again, quite in my view, perfectly understandably, We didn't win the 1st confrontation with the minors. We had to compromise, but that merely hardened the view. We can't let them get away with this, and it was a a a brilliant exercise. Peter Walker, Nigel Lawson, who just piled up the, the coal at the pits and and the power stations. Can Can I come in to ask Alastair on this? So presumably your political memory of this is very, very different from Michael's. Right? When you hear about the the miracle of how brilliant they were in taking on the minors and how How extraordinary Peter Walker and Nigel Lawson were in stockpiling and his memory of the early eighties. Yours is very different. Right? Well, no. I I think No. It's not different, and I think that's where that's where it ended. But along the way, there was an awful lot of really difficult stuff going on politically, which became the kind of fire of politics at that time. And can I invite you to sort of speak more from the Labour point of view through the early isn't how you would have responded listening to this speech from 1980 to 1980? Which one? Oh, the way Michael's talking about taking on the unions and the strikes in the early exit. That's what that's what they were doing. And I think I think that part of it emotionally, how do you feel? How did you feel at the time? How I felt so much memory of that? I was at that time on the on the Daily Mirror, very occasionally in the back of Michael's car as he drove around the country stirring up his own positive profile. Can I put it like that? Staring up a slightly different agenda to the one being taken forward by his wonderful leader. And I also remember the Labour there there was a much clearer divide, I think, between the parties at that time and a lot of these big economic and social issues than maybe during the time when I was then on the other side of the political fence with Tony Blair. But listen. But Margaret Thatcher, I your question about Willey Willey, I think if Willie Whitelow become prime minister, I'd as Michael says, we'll never know. I don't think we'd still be talking about him in the way that we still talk about Margaret Thatcher as a figure of radical change. I think Willie would have been try and quieten the horses and keep things on a on a nice, steady track. Well, I think I think you are right, that Margaret was a particularly, Reactive personality. I've always said about Margaret, there were 2 Margrethets. 1 here, the gut, 1 here. This was very high quality. Which was more powerful, the brain or the gut? The brain in the end, and and there were so many examples of that. But just going back to your question to Alastair, which let me help him. The real the real confrontation was 1968, Barbara Castle and Harold Wilson, white paper in place of strife. And so the Labour I was 11. Well, you see, I was much rather older. You were in the House of Commons. Yes. I was in the House of Commons. Yes. So I was in my thirties. The Labour government knew that the union power had to be confronted. Okay. They didn't do it, and we can there's Plenty of reasons why. I think Jim Callahan wasn't keen on doing what Harold Wilson wanted to do. But in the end, he played the price Because the winter of discontent of 1978 was perhaps one of the most acute social Tensions of our modern time, and that was under a Labour government. And that was a year before we came to pound 79. So although You could argue whether it's tutorial labor who did it. The fact is that all governments knew this issue had to be confronted. So there you go. That was a quick sneak preview of Rory and me speaking to Lord Heseltine. Things get a little bit heated with a few polite disagreements later on. But if you want to hear the full interview, you just have to search leading wherever you get your podcasts and subscribe to hear new episodes every Monday.

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nHi there. It's me, Alastair Campbell. Welcome to The Rest is Politics. Today, I want to introduce you to our exciting new podcast, Leading. Rory and I have decided to set up a dedicated interview feed and differentiate it from The Rest is Politics, the main podcast, because, crucially, not all the interviews we're going to do will be with politicians.\n\nEvery Monday, we're gonna try and speak to people who are leading in their field or have led or could lead or might lead or want to lead. Could be presidents, policymakers, Sports stars, religious leaders, we're going to be hosting some of the best and biggest names from many, many different walks of life. And we were both thrilled with our 1st guest for leading Former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine still looking and sounding pretty good at 89 years of age. One of the biggest names in the history of British politics, Michael Heseltine discusses everything from his crucial role in the rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher, his current position in the House of Lords, and his current very interesting views on politics. So here is a quick preview from Leading with Michael Heseltine out right now.\n\nTo hear the rest, just search leading wherever you get your podcasts. But for now, enjoy this sneak peek. When Margaret Thatcher died, how did you feel? What did what was your assessment of her life and and legacy and and her role in your life.\n\nSpeaker 1: We had, as colleagues, a a a very good relationship. I mean, that doesn't mean to say we liked each other or were friends. That that that's ridiculous. That's not the nature of the relationships of people in business or universities or hospitals or politics. But You work alongside someone, with someone, and sometimes you work for somebody.\n\nAnd in my experience with Margaret, She knew what I believed, and it often coincided with what she believed. Indeed, in some in some curious ways, she tried to use me to change the process of government. There was a a disastrous evening. Because If you look at the number of ministers who actually ran their departments and ran them the way Margaret wanted, I come out top of the the queue. I mean, I closed down more Quangos, even than Keith Joseph, I beat him by 1.\n\nI ran down my department by 3% per annum, which was way ahead of what everyone else was doing. And Margaret looked at the techniques I was using and thought they were so impressive that she, invited me to give a, What frankly was a tutorial to the cabinet. It was a disaster. You can imagine. I mean, because it meant\n\nSpeaker 0: Really detailed\n\nSpeaker 1: draft And and the exploration of things like organograms and and, like, spreadsheets and you know? And you can imagine Quentin Hailsham and Willie Whitelaw sitting there being told by this extraordinary phenomenon from the Welsh valleys were not the valleys, but from Swansea. And there was a small businessman and all this telling us, you know, the great figures of historic.\n\nSpeaker 2: What would William Whitelaw have been like as prime minister? People thought that he had a good chance against mister\n\nSpeaker 1: Farage. Supported him, against Margaret.\n\nSpeaker 2: What what would he have been like as a prime minister?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, look. You you will never know because it's what you will never know is what people will be like under pressure. But I think he'd have been a a good prime minister. The the on the big the descending issue of, the trade union power, which was actually where 1979 pushed us. There was complete unity in the cabinet.\n\nIndeed, the extraordinary thing about Margaret's cabinet is it was Ted's cabinet given the 2nd chance, and that was invaluable because we were battle hardened and experienced, and we knew what we're gonna do. There was no dissent, and Willie would have Done it, in in the same way that we all did it. And and, again, quite in my view, perfectly understandably, We didn't win the 1st confrontation with the minors. We had to compromise, but that merely hardened the view. We can't let them get away with this, and it was a a a brilliant exercise.\n\nPeter Walker, Nigel Lawson, who just piled up the, the coal at the pits and and the power stations.\n\nSpeaker 2: Can Can I come in to ask Alastair on this? So presumably your political memory of this is very, very different from Michael's. Right? When you hear about the the miracle of how brilliant they were in taking on the minors and how How extraordinary Peter Walker and Nigel Lawson were in stockpiling and his memory of the early eighties. Yours is very different.\n\nRight?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, no. I I think No. It's not different, and I think that's where that's where it ended. But along the way, there was an awful lot of really difficult stuff going on politically, which became the kind of fire of politics at that time.\n\nSpeaker 2: And can I invite you to sort of speak more from the Labour point of view through the early isn't how you would have responded listening to this speech from 1980 to 1980?\n\nSpeaker 0: Which one?\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh, the way Michael's talking about taking on the unions and the strikes\n\nSpeaker 0: in the early exit. That's what that's what they were doing. And I think I think that part of it emotionally,\n\nSpeaker 2: how do you feel? How did you feel at the time?\n\nSpeaker 0: How I felt so much memory\n\nSpeaker 2: of that?\n\nSpeaker 0: I was at that time on the on the Daily\n\nSpeaker 1: Mirror,\n\nSpeaker 0: very occasionally in the back of Michael's car as he drove around the country stirring up his own positive profile. Can I put it like that? Staring up a slightly different agenda to the one being taken forward by his wonderful leader. And I also remember the Labour there there was a much clearer divide, I think, between the parties at that time and a lot of these big economic and social issues than maybe during the time when I was then on the other side of the political fence with Tony Blair. But listen.\n\nBut Margaret Thatcher, I your question about Willey Willey, I think if Willie Whitelow become prime minister, I'd as Michael says, we'll never know. I don't think we'd still be talking about him in the way that we still talk about Margaret Thatcher as a figure of radical change. I think Willie would have been try and quieten the horses and keep things on a on a nice, steady track.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think I think you are right, that Margaret was a particularly, Reactive personality. I've always said about Margaret, there were 2 Margrethets. 1 here, the gut, 1 here. This was very high quality.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which was more powerful, the brain or the gut?\n\nSpeaker 1: The brain in the end, and and there were so many examples of that. But just going back to your question to Alastair, which let me help him. The real the real confrontation was 1968, Barbara Castle and Harold Wilson, white paper in place of strife. And so the Labour\n\nSpeaker 0: I was 11.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you see, I was much rather older.\n\nSpeaker 2: You were in the House of Commons.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I was in the House of Commons. Yes. So I was in my thirties. The Labour government knew that the union power had to be confronted.\n\nOkay. They didn't do it, and we can there's Plenty of reasons why. I think Jim Callahan wasn't keen on doing what Harold Wilson wanted to do. But in the end, he played the price Because the winter of discontent of 1978 was perhaps one of the most acute social Tensions of our modern time, and that was under a Labour government. And that was a year before we came to pound 79.\n\nSo although You could argue whether it's tutorial labor who did it. The fact is that all governments knew this issue had to be confronted.\n\nSpeaker 0: So there you go. That was a quick sneak preview of Rory and me speaking to Lord Heseltine. Things get a little bit heated with a few polite disagreements later on. But if you want to hear the full interview, you just have to search leading wherever you get your podcasts and subscribe to hear new episodes every Monday.
