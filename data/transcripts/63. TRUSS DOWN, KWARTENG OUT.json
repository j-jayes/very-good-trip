Welcome to The Rest is Politics Special edition on the resignation of the chancellor with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell, who had I been introducing, it would have said the sacking of the chancellor. That that is just the sacking of the chancellor. Let's be honest here. He was fired. I think so. Pretty pretty dramatic. It was one of those ones where Become normal now, hasn't it, when they fly back from abroad? Everybody follows them on flight tracker, and then helicopters start whirring above number 10. And it all came out of this This, IMF meeting, didn't it? So he can't hurry back from the IMF. He need to be fired. There was obviously a lot of immediate assignment. I very much doubt that he will replace The flight of her majesty the queen from Scotland to England, which apparently was the most tracked flight in the history of flight tracking. Wow. But, yeah, no, he he he was so there was Quasi Kuarteng out in America, did an interview, asked if he would be in he and Liz Truss would be in the same job in a month's time, and he said 100%, absolutely. I'm not going anywhere. And meanwhile, number 10 was booking his flight back. I don't know where it goes from here because I don't know if you were able to see her press conference today, Roy, but it was it was pretty bad. And I don't see how she divorces herself from the fact that she didn't say he had done anything wrong. She basically she she's been in lockstep, as she keeps saying, with him on this. It's her budget. It's her plan. I we got a wonderful when when we announced that we're doing this Emergency podcast. There was a wonderful lesson, a wonderful message from somebody called Stephen Hopkins, which says that now that she's reversed the mini budget or parts of it, does that mean that she's part of the anti growth coalition? That's good. But I can presumably, she is. Well, you know, what we were told by both her and Kuateng was that if unless you agreed with what she was trying to do, He was somehow anti growth. And, of course, Jeremy Hunt now, I mean, to all intents and purposes, he's virtually the prime minister. Yeah. Well, so so just just just yeah. I mean, well, quickly on that, but just just to remind listeners of just how dramatic this has been and how quick this has been. So, Basically, this has all unravelled in 3 weeks. Liz Truss and Quasi Quoten came in just before the Queen died, so really Weeks were occupied. The 1st few weeks of her premiership were occupied with with the queen's funeral and the new king taking over, so she only really got going with this mini which was meant to be the great big start to her premiership, and as we discussed on the podcast, it was meant to set the tone, and I think Alastair, Riddhi, who understands this stuff much better than anyone else, was saying this is the moment at which she needs to take the initiative, set the agenda. That's when she's gonna announce the the price cap on energy and where she can set out her stall, so sure enough, the the mini budget was announced by Kwasikoteng, and from the moment it came out. Everything conceivable went wrong. I mean, there were immediately scandals about him going off to Drink champagne with hedge fund donors, a meet but in before it was announced, but the much more dramatic thing, of course, is that Within a very short period of the announcement, the markets which Liz Truss and Quasi Quoting had assumed would be very excited by the Growth's agenda and the tax cuts and the sort of radical free market libertarian agenda were instead horrified, horrified that The government was proposing to spend an incredible amount, borrow an incredible amount, and cut taxes on the back of spending and borrowing, and so currency went into freefall. Guilts collapsed. Mortgage interest rates. I was talking to someone this morning who got a mortgage in July, for 2.4%. I was offered 6.7% last week, and and that, of course, for somebody on a low income, is Completely devastating. I mean, that's tripling your, and and mortgage is often the very biggest part of the cost of many people's incomes if they've just bought a house. So, anyway, that that's the message. But but back to you on on on Jeremy Hunt becoming the prime minister. Steve Bryan, who I think is a a a Hunt Sunak supporter, He's been going around the place saying that, well, how you'd have to view this government now is that Liz Truss is the chairman, and Jeremy is effectively the chief executive officer. Now this does give Jeremy Hunt enormous power. I think in to some extent, I I can see While it's a moderately sensible appointment, he's got quite a good reputation inside the conservative party. He has been around the block. I don't think it will help them, in putting off a nurses' strike. I think his name is pretty much mud within the National Health Service. But I think he will kind of calm the Tory party down a bit. But the messages I don't know about you, but the messages I've been getting from the the Torys who keep sending me messages Is that even if they're glad that Kuo Teng has gone, they don't see how that helps her authority because it was her budget. And secondly, I think they watched the press conference with absolute horror. And one thing that's becoming really, really Clem, you said the other day that, you know, she was able to kind of relax and be quite charming in pub in private and so forth. But it strikes me she has no EQ, emotional quotient, emotional intelligence, whatsoever. And that press conference, I know you you didn't have time to see it, but if I just tell you, and I don't know if you know this, Roy, but the the the I think one of the longest pop songs in history is American Pie by Don McLean, which was 8 minutes 42 seconds long. Yeah. Her press conference came well under that because she said a few words with a few platitudes. She announced this u-turn on corporation tax. And then she took 4 questions, and it was extraordinary to watch because the press is sitting there. The normal thing that's been done down the years is you call the BBC, call ITV, call Sky. She's obviously decided she's not doing that because she doesn't like them, So she called the guy from The Daily Telegraph who, of course, had been the the 1 paper that's, apart from The Express, has been saying this budget was wonderful. Yep. Yeah. And the guy from The Telegraph asked quite a difficult question. Then she called Harry Cole, who's, you know, virtually part of the Downey Street family. From The Sun? Yep. From The Sun, and he asked quite a tough question. Then she called Robert Peston, but she, for some reason, called him Robert Robert Peston, Literally like that, Robert Pest on. And then she called Chris Mason of the BBC, who I might have got the order wrong there, but Chris Mason just asked a very, very straight Blunt question. What on earth gives you the right to stand there and pretend you have any credibility and authority as as a prime minister? And she gave the same answers to all of them and then walked off. Yeah. So so let's just I don't know. Just it's amazing, but let let's just take it back and deconstruct a couple of things very quickly Click again for listeners who've not been following every nook and cranny of this. So we often say on the podcast that the right wing media has been absolutely critical to the Success of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, and it's absolutely true. Of course, the right wing media has been very, very important to their success, but There's been a very noticeable turn against Liz Truss from a loss of these major newspapers, and The Telegraph, for example, led, That's Front Page Telegraph obviously the biggest right wing, broadsheet out there, with Petroquasi courting and a huge, A sign above its head saying, I'm staying in my job, which is, you know, a real clue that the poor man was on his way out. And and, And, you know, this was also the paper that I was saying last week ran with a huge photograph of a Tory minister who'd been sacked in a A sex scandal. So along with those questions, I think she's in trouble with her base, but it's also true that She is part of this accelerating world, I think. Well, I mean, these premises are lasting shorter and shorter times. It's becoming like You have to go back really to the 18th, 19th century to see prime ministers dropping 3 of them in a year. And that's somehow because structurally 21st century conservative politics is becoming like 18th 19th century politics, and what that means is the politics before the full emergence of the modern party system because party discipline is splitting. And what's happening is these people are being toppled almost as soon as they get in. But isn't it a bit but I do think there's something in peculiarity of British You know, you've just seen Macron win another election. You've seen Merkel have 4 terms. The Portuguese guy got reelected. I mean, I I and by the way, on the on the sort of the the turnover, I saw somebody pointing out they've now had 4 chancellors within a year. Labour have had 4 chancellors since 1967. That's that's quite a fact. That's since 67 is quite because Gordon Brown of course, a lot of those years, Labour weren't in power, but that you know, quite a lot they were. And, of course, Gordon Brown had a decade, Alastair Darling. Yeah. And I'll tell you the other problem with with Jeremy Hunt, though, that I think will become a problem. It's perfectly obvious now, Rory, whatever she said started the other day about there aren't going to be spending cuts. She she indicated today she's she she that there will. I kinda read that between the lines of what she's saying. Jeremy Hunt is quite closely associated with your old friend, Austerity, and I don't believe the country will take anything like the Austerity that they tried last One 100%, and and and, I'm I'm sorry that I keep keep kind of looping back, but, again, just in case Listeners aren't completely on top of who Jeremy Hunt is. Our listeners know everything. He's very, very well informed. So very quickly, Jeremy Hunt, MP came in. He was like this sort of classic kind of tall, almost the only, sort of front bench Tory MP kind of Tall and good lucky enough to be a kind of American politician, so sort of out of central casting, 6 foot 3, he was head boy at his school, Head of the conservato Child of the house. Exactly. A son of an an admiral with a knighthood speaks, I think speaks Pretty fluent Japanese, as Faran said, she gave a speech to Japanese, made a lot of money, setting up a company. 40,000,000. Got oh, very good. Got into politics in 2,000 better than me on the facts. Gordon of Politics 2005, was very close to David Cameron and Cameron made him a cabinet minister in 2010, initially Cultural media and sport where he got in a big scandal to do with whether or not people were talking. I think it was whether or not they were talking to Murdoch During the phone BSky b. Yep. Exactly. So he then moved on from that to be the health secretary, then the foreign secretary, and he ran Against Boris Johnson in Leadership 2019 when I was running, and he made it into the last 2, and Boris Johnson defeated him by a very large margin. It looks as though his career was really finished because he didn't really feature at all in the leadership running this time round when Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss were coming through, But what will have been happening is Liz Truss will have been casting around thinking, which chancellor can I appoint to reassure the markets, and I wonder whether she would have considered Rishi Sunak? That would have been a possible call because, of course, he was the 1 person Clearly, for weeks, he's been saying that what she would do would destroy the pound, destroy the guilts, and was trying to push against this tax cutting. She probably considered Sajid Javid, who'd been the chancellor before, but in the end she went for Jeremy Hunt because, I guess, he's seen Unusually as a very senior neutral figure, he was somebody who wasn't associated with Boris Johnson's government. He's a throwback to what Nostalgically, people now see probably as the more centrist days of Cameron conservatism, but, and we can come back I'm not sure he really can reassure the markets because but we we can talk about that a bit more. Anyway, over to you. I thought it was interesting that she seemed to think, In the in the 4 answers that she gave where she basically said the same thing, she'd obviously been told, don't say anything that upsets But I think today was about sentiment. It was about mood. It was about what sense people had from her, and she didn't look confident. She didn't she didn't emanate confidence. And I don't think that people looking at that, whether they were members of the public, MPs, or people who are working on the trading floors, were going to take much confidence out of it. But she kept saying, I've acted decisively today to deliver economic stability. How on earth can you even say that? And just getting rid of quasi quarteng and replacing him with Jeremy Hunt, who, as you say, has not actually got a track he's got a track record as a minister. People can say whether it's good or it's bad, but he's got no there's no sense of him being somebody who understands or appreciates how the markets work. So so one of the things that, makes me a little anxious about Jeremy Hunt is that although he's got this reputation as a very centrist, steady pair of hands, That wasn't really how I experienced him. During the Brexit thing, although he was a remainer, he was one of the people in Theresa May's cabinet who Seemed to go increasingly towards rejecting her deal. He was one of the people who during the leadership campaign Was very much on the side of I'm going to deliver a deal by this date and we're gonna get out and I'm gonna solve the Northern Ireland problem, And he was very much, I think more importantly, on the side of I'm going to cut taxes, I'm going to generate US level growth, which is a very strange comment because we haven't really had US level growth since the From a ward, he was gonna double defence spending, so he was very much, at that stage in 2019, on the quasi courteng Liz trust wing of the party, which believed that if you just cut taxes, you would automatically generate Mhmm. Unprecedented growth, and you would be able to spend an enormous amount more on conservative things like defense. Well, our, our good friend, professor Tim Bale, who regularly gives us food for thought on the podcast, he sent us a message this afternoon saying, I'm sure you remember Jeremy Hunt's signature policy when he ran for leader against Johnston in 2019 was cutting corporation tax to 12.5%. I also think in the in the last leadership election, this one that just went by, that ended up with Truss, I I think we discussed this earlier, not necessarily just in relation to Hunt. Well, I think those people who were sort of what I call the kind of pretend Brexiteers, the ones who, because the wind had blown so much in that direction, the conservative party that they were trying to sort of not just put a brave face on it, but actually pretend that they'd embraced it. I think he had moved right over into the kind of popular space. But he has got he's there's no doubt about it now within what's happening in the conservative party. I still think she's toast. I still think she's finished. But I think and until she goes, he is now in a very, very powerful position. And, you know, a lot of the talk seems to be I I did that, BBC newscast podcast last night. You didn't. You didn't. I did. But Rory but Rory, I got so many plugs in for the pod for our cast. It was and also Craig Oliver did the best pocket plug for our podcast tomorrow. So, honestly, it was really worth doing. Believe me. But, anyway, Chris Mason was was present here They're the BBC political editor, and he was just giving me a sense of what it had been like for him walking around the commons during the day and the sorts of things that were being said by conservative MPs that he was bumping into. And I don't think they'll be settled simply by the idea that she's got rid of Quarton because I think they think it's about this trust. Let's go to a break, but after the break, I'd love to return to this very interesting question of why we've moved into this Accelerated world, where there's some lovely stuff going on on social media at the moment. The the star is has a live feed seeing whether- The letters. Trust will outlive the letters. Yep. Then you've got ferry washing up liquid, 1 bottle lasts longer than 3 conservative leaders. Anyway, Let let's return off the break and and maybe look at some of the structural reasons why British politics has accelerated in this way. Over to the break. So welcome back to this emergency 999 podcast with me, Alastair Campbell. And me, Rory Stewart. While we're talking about quasi, Rory, I was looking up This is how sad I am. I was looking up Quasi Kuarteng's maiden speech Oh, gosh. Okay. When he became an MP in 2010. Now as you know from your maiden speech, You're not meant to be too sort of controversial. It's one of the many ridiculous conventions in the house, but I I don't know if Gordon Brown or Alastair Darling are listening to our podcast. I know they both have people who do because I occasionally get messages from them. But so please make sure that Gordon and Alastair know In Kwasikwatieng's maiden speech, he said this. They, by which he meant them, have not once accepted any blame for what happened. They seem to think we can just sail on as before, which frankly, I think we could all say about Liz Truss today. There was no blame. She actually was saying her strategy was right. Quasi did nothing wrong. It's just that she had to stabilize the markets, and this was the way she decided to Before we leave, Kwasikotang, I mean, it is very interesting. I mean, he is, he's been a very radical voice and one of the things that we talked about in the last podcast when I was in North Africa was Libya, And we talked about field marshal Hiftar, who's this very sinister figure with the secret police and these amazing kind of Islamist control mechanisms It controls a lot of eastern Libya, and quasi quoting, somebody sent me an article he'd written in Evening Standard endorsing Iftar and saying what Libya needs is a strongman, just a few years ago, and it's a a sort of reminder that How provocative, sort of dangerously provocative he's been because, actually, that was a very, very bad idea. Phil Marshall Iftar is a very bad man, and I'm Very troubled to see that he'd been endorsing him. Anyway Why didn't why didn't you say that before when you were telling us that he was a friend of yours, and you liked him, and you Or to Stornley's He is he he is a friend of mine, and I I do like him, and I I it's a difficult thing to say. I mean, he's somebody who was I knew it's this gangly 13 year old. He was incredibly bright. I mean, he came in with a it's an extraordinary story, came from this Gunner and family with a a very, very high scholarship to Wheaton, he was incredibly eager, Charming he. We used to discuss modernist poetry when he was 14, and, And he had this great kind of gruff persona, but I would never have guessed for a moment that he was gonna Become a politician and and I think he could have been, you know, a a great sort of provocative university lecturer Poor teacher. And I just think it's a tragedy that he he got into politics. And, Sydney, I've got a sort of small apology to you. No. Not a small apology, a big apology. In trying to work out how to describe Quasi Courting and Liz Truss, I said that in trying to describe the fact that they Throw out ideas and they won't sit down and discuss them and they seem to change what they're saying every, you know, few minutes. I said they had attention deficit disorder. And that was very, very, you know, that that was wrong of me, and I've a number of people who reached out to me who either have ADHD or have children with ADHD to say that actually people with ADHD, unlike these politicians, often have Extreme empathy. They have deep, deep empathy for other people, that their lives are very difficult and that it's To to to take awful politicians and sort of use attention deficit disorder as an insult It's awful. So I wanna very much apologize for that. And said, I've got a lot of learning to do. I'm glad to hear that because I I I had a little I had a gentle go at you about it in relation when we talk about being a bit weird and all that because I I felt that was part of the same thing. And and if the the the program, that I'm doing with Saidah. Make me prime minister. One of the candidates, who is really aren't the strongest, and anybody who saw the episode this week would to see that Kelly from Scotland is really is amongst the strongest, and and she has autism. And and and I do think that we are Often a bit too casual about how we use language to do with, you know, whether it's autism or Spectrum or Asperger's or whatever, I think so. So, anyway, well done for fessing up to that one, Rory. Yeah. No. That that was not good. Very very quickly, just on the on the, Acceleration points. So I think that the the reason why things were accelerating so we went from a world in which Obviously, Mrs Thatcher was in for a long time, 10 years. John Major was was in for a long time, 7 years. Tony Blair was in for how many years? 10. 10. Right. And then Born by Gordon, 3. Gordon Gordon, 3. But Gordon Brown only finished by an election, Otherwise he would have continued, and then obviously David Cameron in for 6. And so that that that's the norm in British politics, It's the way we sort of think about British politics in the in the modern era. And then suddenly things began to accelerate. I mean obviously Theresa May Did about 2. Boris Johnson did about 2, and it feels as though Liz Truss is going to be lucky to do a few months. And so why is this? And this is where I I go to you, Alastair, because I think it's the big word that you understand better than anyone. What is the reason why things are accelerating so much? Well, Brexit? It is Brexit, isn't it? I think a lot well, I think it's I think it look. It's complicated. I do I really do. I was in Dublin on on Tuesday, and I was I was actually making at a conference. I was speaking about Brexit, and, Definitely, the the view in the room was that Britain has not recovered from Brexit. This these were Irish business people. They feel that Britain has just taken a terrible step into an unknown future, and they and we we, Britain, can't work out how to how to manage it. But I think the other thing that's going on, I'm reading a book at the moment by Christopher Wylie. Do you remember Christopher Wylie, the guy who worked for Cambridge Analytica and then became Western Blower. And Yeah. Yeah. That guy. I can say the title of the book in a way I probably couldn't say it on the BBC. It's called mind fuck. Jovian banned from Sky for our for our abusive language. I saw that, but they swear. They say they maybe don't say the f word. But, anyway, we can get by without Sky. We have more people listening to us than watch Sky, Rory. Don't worry about that. But and by the way, I'm really sorry, everybody. We have sold out the by that. It's sold out in 7 minutes Yeah. Which is utterly ridiculous. As you can imagine, because Alastair sometimes gets quite confident. He has these moments Confidence. He was trying to tell us the Palladium was too small and we needed to play, what was it, o two Wembley Arena? I thought the o two were Wembley. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And now, of course, he's Absolutely convinced to this because the Palladium, which had 2 and a half 1000 seats sold out in 7 minutes. You're the one who keeps talking about Harry Lauder and Yeah. Well, I I thought well, I mean, because Friend of Harry Harry Lauder, Max Miller, you know, Tony Hancock fan, I think those places are pretty big because, you know, Bob Mankaus didn't always sell out the palladium, so I I thought that was about as good as we could do, but, obviously I wonder if, Boris Johnson will be on that circuit. I see you got a 150,000 for his speech the other day. I I mean, I think people will be quite offended by that. You know? Yeah. He's completely screwed the country. He's left us with a total dud. He's got a constituency to run. He's still an MP, And he's he's gone and picked up a $150 for a speech and and then taking his family on holiday. Although although, I think Of all the things that these ex prime ministers do, I mean, Tony Blair also made a lot of money from speaking, and and ex politicians do, It's probably it I can see do, Rory. You do do. We we do. You do? And I can see it's upsetting for people, but it is less bad than than many of the other things they could do. It's much less bad than lobbying, much less bad than taking dodgy jobs. Oh, it's also, in his case, is much less bad than him being prime minister, so I don't care if he gets $10,000,000 as long as he's never prime minister again. The the question is why does somebody want to pay all that money to him? And that's what surprises me. That's That's a good question. So we were talking about this long, average thing. And Chris Wiley's book, Mind fuck, really does I'm I'm only about a third of the way through. But I I I do think that social media has It's accelerated it's accelerated people's intolerance, and I think it's made people I think politicians Have far less ability to get away with the benefit of the doubt when once they're in power. I think this stuff helps bad guys get into power, But I think once they're in, if there isn't a basic level of competence, I think you're done for quicker. Yep. And and and so and I I do say, Roy, there there aren't you know, we used to all laugh about Italy where they changed prime minister every 10 minutes, but I think we are becoming seen as that kind of basket. Well, you can completely I mean, well, because Boris Johnson is Burlesconi, basically. Right? And and now, people are Trying to bring in a sort of Mario Draghi figure in the chancellor. They're trying to get a reassuring technocrat to come in, which is what they want. Is is let's trust Georgia Maloney. Well, she's she's not yet, but of course, is it round the corner? So I I think the way in which Brexit plays into this isn't just the economics, It's the way in which, Brexit as a manifestation, as you say, of populism and its acceleration in the way that social media accelerates things has driven the Conservative Party because this is a party that from the moment Brexit passed was split, Initially, with the majority of people having voted Remain, then the majority of people having voted Brexit, but completely unreconciled to itself. So Theresa May was Destroyed by the Brexit right of the party. Boris Johnson, many of the people who moved against him were from the remain left of the Conservative Party, which is why many, Boris supporters have never really forgiven that. Liz Truss won on the back of the Brexit Right. So she was seen as a Boris Johnson loyalist, and the people who came out immediately against her were mostly on the non Brexit left. There were some exceptions. She put a few remains of cabinet. But basically the Conservative Party is in a civil war, and it's a civil war between the kind of libertarian, almost Trumpian populist right, And the more 1 nation conservatism, which was trying to win votes in the centre ground, which David Cameron came out of. And and this war's been going on, really, un since since my statute went. I think it's more complicated than that. I think you've got the 1 nation, and you've got the libertarians. But I don't think all the populists are necessarily in the same place as Truss's libertarianism. I think that's something that's Yeah. Even more concrete. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. That's right because a lot of the populists I mean, you're right. Boris Johnson was not on the side of what this trust fund did. He, of course, approved these tax rises To balance the budgets. So, and and He he he was obviously part of the anti growth coalition. Well, that that's what she means. I mean, she's saying since 2008, we've had anaemic growth, And she in that press conference, and she blames it almost entirely on the fact that taxes are too high. Now you you then said, I think, something very important, which is the fundamental question here, which is about whether the public will Where more cuts? And the answer is, of course, they will not. They they really will not. And, although we've had our disagreements, Many disagreements about austerity, and I would actually say that in a way, the way in which Quasi Quoting and Liz Truss blew up the markets and blew up the country is, from my point of view, if you come from my side of politics, A reminder of why people like me believed that being prudent fiscally, being responsible fiscally balancing the budget matters that if you're seen to borrow and spend too much, you can really trash stuff. By the way, just on on our previous arguments about austerity, I think you said last week that The the Labour had no plan to to to bring it down. I think I'm right that the election, the Labour lost. Alastair Darling was talking about reducing it at at half the pace that that that John that Osborne said he was going to do. So I don't think you were quite right on that one, Rory. But we should maybe get we should try and get Gordon and Alistair on and We We should get them on. We want we want them on. We want them on, and we should we should talk we should talk talk through I mean, they definitely were talking about cuts, and they were definitely talking about cuts which were less than the Tory cuts, But they would have fallen in different ways. They were actually talking about cuts that would have gone right across the board. They didn't believe in what George Osborne did, which was to protect the NHS, protect education, and increase spend on international development. They tried to argue that The only fair way to do it would be to reduce spending almost equally across departments. Anyway, and and it would be interesting to play through Or critics' vulgarity whether they had really taken on board, what the impact of those labor cuts would have been if they'd come straight. Yep. Keir Starmer has basically said that Truss is now finished. She's a lame duck, and the only way now for the country to get out to begin to get out of this mess is is to have a general election. Do you think there's any chance of getting a general election? No. There's there's no chance of getting a general election because the only way you can get a general election is for the majority of MPs to vote for a general election, And the conservatives won a very, very big majority in 2019. Right. Okay. Let me let me let me ask you another way. Is if the conservatives do get rid of Liz trust. Mhmm. Do you think that they can really inflict upon the country another leadership change without having a general election? Yes. I I think they can. You think they can? I think they can and they probably will. I mean, I think they they're in a - I mean, we've talked about this before - they're in a sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't don't position. I think it's gonna be very difficult for them to win the next election, whatever they do. They're now 30 points behind, And they've blown the only thing that mattered for the Conservative Party because, you know, you and I, completely disagree about whether it was, whether it was, true or not, but there's there's no doubt that a very important part of the conservatives' reputation for 200 Years has been that they were supposed to be the people who were careful with money, who the the cliche was supposed to be, and I I know we disagree about this, but anyway, the The brand, even if it was a fake brand, was meant to be that Labour were sort of nice, generous people who were a bit loose with the cash, and the Tories were nasty people who were careful with the cash. Yeah. So they've blown that. They've they've blown that, and so they're gonna be They're they're now nasty and useless. Yeah. And and they were supposed to be. That was not meant to be their brand. So thank you. Okay. So here's so here's a question for you. Given that Rishi Sunak Literally, almost word for word predicted what would happen if they if they elected Liz Truss. Okay? Do you think that might give him the authority to be the person around whom, even those who voted against him, even those who don't like him, to say, right, the only chance, and it's a slim chance, the only chance we have now is to go with a loaded revolver and a glass of whiskey to Trust say, bye bye. You're finished. And here's Rishi Sunak, and he we are electing him anointed. No election. He is the new leader of the party. He's a new prime minister. Don't you think that's the only thing they've got left? So I I agree with you, Alastair. If if you and I were advising, that's what you gotta do because the the point is that They're gonna look ridiculous, obviously, having, you know, a 3rd leader in this amount of time. It's it's it it'll be humiliating and mad, and many people will say it's It's completely legitimate. But if you look at the alternative, the alternative for them is much, much worse. They cannot possibly win an election under Liz Truss. So long as she remains Prime Minister, it doesn't matter which chance that she brings in, she's not going to reassure the markets. So they will say, I think, ultimately, they'll see the logic, which is they're very unlikely to win the next election, but they have zero chance with Liz Truss, So they might as well roll the dice again. They have at least a 10% chance, maybe, with somebody else. And And if if they if they do Go for an anointing. They don't have to go to the members. The members don't have to endorse that, do they? Well, remember with, yes, is the answer. So with Theresa May, because all the other candidates dropped out, this was when she she came in after David Cameron in 2016. Yeah. Andrea Leadsden dropped out. It didn't go to the membership, she just became the prime minister, so if the MPs want to do that they can absolutely do that, but you're right, in the middle of this there's this Very, very strange thing about the members, which is a problem for the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, which is that there is nothing democratic about Paying money to join a political party. Mhmm. Doesn't matter whether you've got a 100,000 members or 500,000 members. It's not democratic. At least the MPs are elected. Right. They have some kind of democratic mandate and them MPs voting for a prime minister is the traditional way it happened in Britain. It makes Some kind of democratic sense, but the parties doing it is what produced Jeremy Corbyn, it's what produced Boris Johnson, it's what produces Liz Truss, And it's a very, very bad system. I've already been ticked off in the chat box for the plugging, a BBC podcast. I'm now gonna plug Tortoise because James Harding, you mentioned the membership. He's continuing with his attempts to expose the reality of the conservative party membership. I think he's taken the whole leadership process to judicial review because, of course, he he he, enrolled Archie the tortoise, amongst others, as a member of the conservative party, you've got a vote. And and there's no transparency. They won't reveal what the, I mean, it's extraordinary. I mean, I I was obviously, you know, A conservative party member, but until this very good research done by Tortoise Media, which is a very interesting media company, It wasn't made brutally clear until they started doing it just how dodgy the rules around these parties are. They're completely untransparent. They won't reveal their membership lists. They won't tell you how many of their members, and not even British nationals or registered voters. I mean, it's terrifying, Absolutely terrifying. So you're you're so you would like to see, whatever happens next, it is just the MPs who decide? I'd like just the MPs to decide, and I think the only hope for the Conservative Party is to Get rid of Liz Truss because so long as she stays they don't have a chance, bring in somebody and that person would have to come in immediately, Raise taxes, corporation tax, national insurance would have to go up, put some kind of control on spending so we can actually See what happens in a year or 2 with the energy price cap. And if they manage to reassure the markets, if if if if If inflation began coming down, if, because I didn't see it coming down, if interest rates began coming down, And if they actually ran a very, very tight competence ship with a very mature, experienced leader, which I can't see them finding at the moment, They might have a sliver of a chance if Labour did something catastrophic of winning the next election, but I'd I'd put the chance at 10% were the new leader in Xero with Liz Truss. Well, that's great. That's really showing up a lot. And just just to maybe wrap maybe wrap up with this, On the back of, Liz Truss' press conference, the yield on bonds to be paid in 30 years went up to 4.85% in the Which means the prices to yeah. The the bills have gone down. Yeah. The the value of the pound went down. Yeah. So she did not if that was part of the purpose of the press conference, it was not successful. And one one one of your former colleagues I was talking to said, you just get the feeling now that even if they try really hard, even if they do their best, whatever they do, they don't know how to do it. I think she doesn't know how to do the job. I think that, Yet again, we've seen the gap between what it takes to be a cabinet minister and what it takes to be prime minister is Utterly enormous. People have no idea how big that gap is. Well, because you can hide as a cabinet minister. It's very, very easy to hide. I mean, particularly if you're Trade minister or foreign minister, you get to take photographs in front of flags with dignitaries. You don't really have to deliver on policy, And the prime minister carries carries the count. No. It's it's impossible for anybody to know really what it's like to be prime minister, and we need a much better system of testing them. And that's why A loss of the most successful premises seem to have been people who were leaders the opposition before. Yeah. Really helped Tony Blair, helped David Cameron, helped Margaret Thatcher to come in with that experience. Absolutely. Well, maybe maybe that maybe we should choose the next prime minister by Saeed Devastian and I and doing a a TV program. Yeah. I must say I don't know. We should do a talk about this. I'm I'm not completely convinced that the candidates are not sure that will make the brilliant presence. That was a bit of a joke. That was a bit of a joke. Okay. Anyway, I'm I'm glad I'm glad that we were able to do our emergent we pressed the emergency podcast emergency protocol. I I I'd love to I wish we were being filmed so as they could peep people could see exactly what you're wearing, and they they like I can tell tell the listeners. I'm Stark naked. He's dragged me out of the butt, and he's he's admiring my rippling biceps as we speak. Not quite. No cry. We're talking we're talking tweedy 3 piece is what we're talking. And it was lovely to see you, Marie. I think we'll be doing another couple of Podcasts next week so as we can stay right at the top of the charts, selling out big venues, you'll come, you become Max Miller, the Cheeky Cappy, and all will be well in the world, especially once this rotten Tory government is out of power. Great answer on that. Farewell. Speak soon. Bye bye.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to The Rest is Politics Special edition on the resignation of the chancellor with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell, who had I been introducing, it would have said the sacking of the chancellor.\n\nSpeaker 1: That that is just the sacking of the chancellor. Let's be honest here. He was fired.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty pretty dramatic. It was one of those ones where Become normal now, hasn't it, when they fly back from abroad? Everybody follows them on flight tracker, and then helicopters start whirring above number 10. And it all came out of this This, IMF meeting, didn't it? So he can't hurry back from the IMF.\n\nHe need to be fired.\n\nSpeaker 0: There was obviously a lot of immediate assignment. I very much doubt that he will replace The flight of her majesty the queen from Scotland to England, which apparently was the most tracked flight in the history of flight tracking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 0: But, yeah, no, he he he was so there was Quasi Kuarteng out in America, did an interview, asked if he would be in he and Liz Truss would be in the same job in a month's time, and he said 100%, absolutely. I'm not going anywhere. And meanwhile, number 10 was booking his flight back. I don't know where it goes from here because I don't know if you were able to see her press conference today, Roy, but it was it was pretty bad. And I don't see how she divorces herself from the fact that she didn't say he had done anything wrong.\n\nShe basically she she's been in lockstep, as she keeps saying, with him on this. It's her budget. It's her plan. I we got a wonderful when when we announced that we're doing this Emergency podcast. There was a wonderful lesson, a wonderful message from somebody called Stephen Hopkins, which says that now that she's reversed the mini budget or parts of it, does that mean that she's part of the anti growth coalition?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good. But I can presumably, she is.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, you know, what we were told by both her and Kuateng was that if unless you agreed with what she was trying to do, He was somehow anti growth. And, of course, Jeremy Hunt now, I mean, to all intents and purposes, he's virtually the prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, so so just just just yeah. I mean, well, quickly on that, but just just to remind listeners of just how dramatic this has been and how quick this has been. So, Basically, this has all unravelled in 3 weeks. Liz Truss and Quasi Quoten came in just before the Queen died, so really Weeks were occupied.\n\nThe 1st few weeks of her premiership were occupied with with the queen's funeral and the new king taking over, so she only really got going with this mini which was meant to be the great big start to her premiership, and as we discussed on the podcast, it was meant to set the tone, and I think Alastair, Riddhi, who understands this stuff much better than anyone else, was saying this is the moment at which she needs to take the initiative, set the agenda. That's when she's gonna announce the the price cap on energy and where she can set out her stall, so sure enough, the the mini budget was announced by Kwasikoteng, and from the moment it came out. Everything conceivable went wrong. I mean, there were immediately scandals about him going off to Drink champagne with hedge fund donors, a meet but in before it was announced, but the much more dramatic thing, of course, is that Within a very short period of the announcement, the markets which Liz Truss and Quasi Quoting had assumed would be very excited by the Growth's agenda and the tax cuts and the sort of radical free market libertarian agenda were instead horrified, horrified that The government was proposing to spend an incredible amount, borrow an incredible amount, and cut taxes on the back of spending and borrowing, and so currency went into freefall.\n\nGuilts collapsed. Mortgage interest rates. I was talking to someone this morning who got a mortgage in July, for 2.4%. I was offered 6.7% last week, and and that, of course, for somebody on a low income, is Completely devastating. I mean, that's tripling your, and and mortgage is often the very biggest part of the cost of many people's incomes if they've just bought a house.\n\nSo, anyway, that that's the message. But but back to you on on on Jeremy Hunt becoming the prime minister.\n\nSpeaker 0: Steve Bryan, who I think is a a a Hunt Sunak supporter, He's been going around the place saying that, well, how you'd have to view this government now is that Liz Truss is the chairman, and Jeremy is effectively the chief executive officer. Now this does give Jeremy Hunt enormous power. I think in to some extent, I I can see While it's a moderately sensible appointment, he's got quite a good reputation inside the conservative party. He has been around the block. I don't think it will help them, in putting off a nurses' strike.\n\nI think his name is pretty much mud within the National Health Service. But I think he will kind of calm the Tory party down a bit. But the messages I don't know about you, but the messages I've been getting from the the Torys who keep sending me messages Is that even if they're glad that Kuo Teng has gone, they don't see how that helps her authority because it was her budget. And secondly, I think they watched the press conference with absolute horror. And one thing that's becoming really, really Clem, you said the other day that, you know, she was able to kind of relax and be quite charming in pub in private and so forth.\n\nBut it strikes me she has no EQ, emotional quotient, emotional intelligence, whatsoever. And that press conference, I know you you didn't have time to see it, but if I just tell you, and I don't know if you know this, Roy, but the the the I think one of the longest pop songs in history is American Pie by Don McLean, which was 8 minutes 42 seconds long. Yeah. Her press conference came well under that because she said a few words with a few platitudes. She announced this u-turn on corporation tax.\n\nAnd then she took 4 questions, and it was extraordinary to watch because the press is sitting there. The normal thing that's been done down the years is you call the BBC, call ITV, call Sky. She's obviously decided she's not doing that because she doesn't like them, So she called the guy from The Daily Telegraph who, of course, had been the the 1 paper that's, apart from The Express, has been saying this budget was wonderful. Yep. Yeah.\n\nAnd the guy from The Telegraph asked quite a difficult question. Then she called Harry Cole, who's, you know, virtually part of the Downey Street family.\n\nSpeaker 1: From The Sun? Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: From The Sun, and he asked quite a tough question. Then she called Robert Peston, but she, for some reason, called him Robert Robert Peston, Literally like that, Robert Pest on. And then she called Chris Mason of the BBC, who I might have got the order wrong there, but Chris Mason just asked a very, very straight Blunt question. What on earth gives you the right to stand there and pretend you have any credibility and authority as as a prime minister? And she gave the same answers to all of them and then walked off.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So so let's just I don't know. Just it's amazing, but let let's just take it back and deconstruct a couple of things very quickly Click again for listeners who've not been following every nook and cranny of this. So we often say on the podcast that the right wing media has been absolutely critical to the Success of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, and it's absolutely true. Of course, the right wing media has been very, very important to their success, but There's been a very noticeable turn against Liz Truss from a loss of these major newspapers, and The Telegraph, for example, led, That's Front Page Telegraph obviously the biggest right wing, broadsheet out there, with Petroquasi courting and a huge, A sign above its head saying, I'm staying in my job, which is, you know, a real clue that the poor man was on his way out.\n\nAnd and, And, you know, this was also the paper that I was saying last week ran with a huge photograph of a Tory minister who'd been sacked in a A sex scandal. So along with those questions, I think she's in trouble with her base, but it's also true that She is part of this accelerating world, I think. Well, I mean, these premises are lasting shorter and shorter times. It's becoming like You have to go back really to the 18th, 19th century to see prime ministers dropping 3 of them in a year. And that's somehow because structurally 21st century conservative politics is becoming like 18th 19th century politics, and what that means is the politics before the full emergence of the modern party system because party discipline is splitting.\n\nAnd what's happening is these people are being toppled almost as soon as they get in.\n\nSpeaker 0: But isn't it a bit but I do think there's something in peculiarity of British You know, you've just seen Macron win another election. You've seen Merkel have 4 terms. The Portuguese guy got reelected. I mean, I I and by the way, on the on the sort of the the turnover, I saw somebody pointing out they've now had 4 chancellors within a year. Labour have had 4 chancellors since 1967.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's that's quite a fact. That's since 67 is quite because\n\nSpeaker 0: Gordon Brown of course, a lot of those years, Labour weren't in power, but that you know, quite a lot they were. And, of course, Gordon Brown had a decade, Alastair Darling. Yeah. And I'll tell you the other problem with with Jeremy Hunt, though, that I think will become a problem. It's perfectly obvious now, Rory, whatever she said started the other day about there aren't going to be spending cuts.\n\nShe she indicated today she's she she that there will. I kinda read that between the lines of what she's saying. Jeremy Hunt is quite closely associated with your old friend, Austerity, and I don't believe the country will take anything like the Austerity that they tried last\n\nSpeaker 1: One 100%, and and and, I'm I'm sorry that I keep keep kind of looping back, but, again, just in case Listeners aren't completely on top of who Jeremy Hunt is.\n\nSpeaker 0: Our listeners know everything. He's very, very well informed.\n\nSpeaker 1: So very quickly, Jeremy Hunt, MP came in. He was like this sort of classic kind of tall, almost the only, sort of front bench Tory MP kind of Tall and good lucky enough to be a kind of American politician, so sort of out of central casting, 6 foot 3, he was head boy at his school, Head of the conservato Child\n\nSpeaker 0: of the house.\n\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. A son of an an admiral with a knighthood speaks, I think speaks Pretty fluent Japanese, as Faran said, she gave a speech to Japanese, made a lot of money, setting up a company.\n\nSpeaker 0: 40,000,000.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got oh, very good. Got into politics in 2,000 better than me on the facts. Gordon of Politics 2005, was very close to David Cameron and Cameron made him a cabinet minister in 2010, initially Cultural media and sport where he got in a big scandal to do with whether or not people were talking. I think it was whether or not they were talking to Murdoch During the phone\n\nSpeaker 0: BSky b.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Exactly. So he then moved on from that to be the health secretary, then the foreign secretary, and he ran Against Boris Johnson in Leadership 2019 when I was running, and he made it into the last 2, and Boris Johnson defeated him by a very large margin. It looks as though his career was really finished because he didn't really feature at all in the leadership running this time round when Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss were coming through, But what will have been happening is Liz Truss will have been casting around thinking, which chancellor can I appoint to reassure the markets, and I wonder whether she would have considered Rishi Sunak? That would have been a possible call because, of course, he was the 1 person Clearly, for weeks, he's been saying that what she would do would destroy the pound, destroy the guilts, and was trying to push against this tax cutting.\n\nShe probably considered Sajid Javid, who'd been the chancellor before, but in the end she went for Jeremy Hunt because, I guess, he's seen Unusually as a very senior neutral figure, he was somebody who wasn't associated with Boris Johnson's government. He's a throwback to what Nostalgically, people now see probably as the more centrist days of Cameron conservatism, but, and we can come back I'm not sure he really can reassure the markets because but we we can talk about that a bit more. Anyway, over to you.\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought it was interesting that she seemed to think, In the in the 4 answers that she gave where she basically said the same thing, she'd obviously been told, don't say anything that upsets But I think today was about sentiment. It was about mood. It was about what sense people had from her, and she didn't look confident. She didn't she didn't emanate confidence. And I don't think that people looking at that, whether they were members of the public, MPs, or people who are working on the trading floors, were going to take much confidence out of it.\n\nBut she kept saying, I've acted decisively today to deliver economic stability. How on earth can you even say that? And just getting rid of quasi quarteng and replacing him with Jeremy Hunt, who, as you say, has not actually got a track he's got a track record as a minister. People can say whether it's good or it's bad, but he's got no there's no sense of him being somebody who understands or appreciates how the markets work.\n\nSpeaker 1: So so one of the things that, makes me a little anxious about Jeremy Hunt is that although he's got this reputation as a very centrist, steady pair of hands, That wasn't really how I experienced him. During the Brexit thing, although he was a remainer, he was one of the people in Theresa May's cabinet who Seemed to go increasingly towards rejecting her deal. He was one of the people who during the leadership campaign Was very much on the side of I'm going to deliver a deal by this date and we're gonna get out and I'm gonna solve the Northern Ireland problem, And he was very much, I think more importantly, on the side of I'm going to cut taxes, I'm going to generate US level growth, which is a very strange comment because we haven't really had US level growth since the From a ward, he was gonna double defence spending, so he was very much, at that stage in 2019, on the quasi courteng Liz trust wing of the party, which believed that if you just cut taxes, you would automatically generate Mhmm. Unprecedented growth, and you would be able to spend an enormous amount more on conservative things like defense.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, our, our good friend, professor Tim Bale, who regularly gives us food for thought on the podcast, he sent us a message this afternoon saying, I'm sure you remember Jeremy Hunt's signature policy when he ran for leader against Johnston in 2019 was cutting corporation tax to 12.5%. I also think in the in the last leadership election, this one that just went by, that ended up with Truss, I I think we discussed this earlier, not necessarily just in relation to Hunt. Well, I think those people who were sort of what I call the kind of pretend Brexiteers, the ones who, because the wind had blown so much in that direction, the conservative party that they were trying to sort of not just put a brave face on it, but actually pretend that they'd embraced it. I think he had moved right over into the kind of popular space. But he has got he's there's no doubt about it now within what's happening in the conservative party.\n\nI still think she's toast. I still think she's finished. But I think and until she goes, he is now in a very, very powerful position. And, you know, a lot of the talk seems to be I I did that, BBC newscast podcast last night.\n\nSpeaker 1: You didn't.\n\nSpeaker 0: You didn't. I did. But Rory but Rory, I got so many plugs in for the pod for our cast. It was and also Craig Oliver did the best pocket plug for our podcast tomorrow. So, honestly, it was really worth doing.\n\nBelieve me. But, anyway, Chris Mason was was present here They're the BBC political editor, and he was just giving me a sense of what it had been like for him walking around the commons during the day and the sorts of things that were being said by conservative MPs that he was bumping into. And I don't think they'll be settled simply by the idea that she's got rid of Quarton because I think they think it's about this trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let's go to a break, but after the break, I'd love to return to this very interesting question of why we've moved into this Accelerated world, where there's some lovely stuff going on on social media at the moment. The the star is has a live feed seeing whether- The letters. Trust will outlive the letters. Yep. Then you've got ferry washing up liquid, 1 bottle lasts longer than 3 conservative leaders.\n\nAnyway, Let let's return off the break and and maybe look at some of the structural reasons why British politics has accelerated in this way. Over to the break.\n\nSpeaker 0: So welcome back to this emergency 999 podcast with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: While we're talking about quasi, Rory, I was looking up This is how sad I am. I was looking up Quasi Kuarteng's maiden speech\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, gosh. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: When he became an MP in 2010. Now as you know from your maiden speech, You're not meant to be too sort of controversial. It's one of the many ridiculous conventions in the house, but I I don't know if Gordon Brown or Alastair Darling are listening to our podcast. I know they both have people who do because I occasionally get messages from them. But so please make sure that Gordon and Alastair know In Kwasikwatieng's maiden speech, he said this.\n\nThey, by which he meant them, have not once accepted any blame for what happened. They seem to think we can just sail on as before, which frankly, I think we could all say about Liz Truss today. There was no blame. She actually was saying her strategy was right. Quasi did nothing wrong.\n\nIt's just that she had to stabilize the markets, and this was the way she decided to\n\nSpeaker 1: Before we leave, Kwasikotang, I mean, it is very interesting. I mean, he is, he's been a very radical voice and one of the things that we talked about in the last podcast when I was in North Africa was Libya, And we talked about field marshal Hiftar, who's this very sinister figure with the secret police and these amazing kind of Islamist control mechanisms It controls a lot of eastern Libya, and quasi quoting, somebody sent me an article he'd written in Evening Standard endorsing Iftar and saying what Libya needs is a strongman, just a few years ago, and it's a a sort of reminder that How provocative, sort of dangerously provocative he's been because, actually, that was a very, very bad idea. Phil Marshall Iftar is a very bad man, and I'm Very troubled to see that he'd been endorsing him.\n\nSpeaker 0: Anyway Why didn't why didn't you say that before when you were telling us that he was a friend of yours, and you liked him, and you Or to Stornley's\n\nSpeaker 1: He is he he is a friend of mine, and I I do like him, and I I it's a difficult thing to say. I mean, he's somebody who was I knew it's this gangly 13 year old. He was incredibly bright. I mean, he came in with a it's an extraordinary story, came from this Gunner and family with a a very, very high scholarship to Wheaton, he was incredibly eager, Charming he. We used to discuss modernist poetry when he was 14, and, And he had this great kind of gruff persona, but I would never have guessed for a moment that he was gonna Become a politician and and I think he could have been, you know, a a great sort of provocative university lecturer Poor teacher.\n\nAnd I just think it's a tragedy that he he got into politics. And, Sydney, I've got a sort of small apology to you. No. Not a small apology, a big apology. In trying to work out how to describe Quasi Courting and Liz Truss, I said that in trying to describe the fact that they Throw out ideas and they won't sit down and discuss them and they seem to change what they're saying every, you know, few minutes.\n\nI said they had attention deficit disorder. And that was very, very, you know, that that was wrong of me, and I've a number of people who reached out to me who either have ADHD or have children with ADHD to say that actually people with ADHD, unlike these politicians, often have Extreme empathy. They have deep, deep empathy for other people, that their lives are very difficult and that it's To to to take awful politicians and sort of use attention deficit disorder as an insult It's awful. So I wanna very much apologize for that. And said, I've got a lot of learning to do.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm glad to hear that because I I I had a little I had a gentle go at you about it in relation when we talk about being a bit weird and all that because I I felt that was part of the same thing. And and if the the the program, that I'm doing with Saidah. Make me prime minister. One of the candidates, who is really aren't the strongest, and anybody who saw the episode this week would to see that Kelly from Scotland is really is amongst the strongest, and and she has autism. And and and I do think that we are Often a bit too casual about how we use language to do with, you know, whether it's autism or Spectrum or Asperger's or whatever, I think so.\n\nSo, anyway, well done for fessing up to that one, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. That that was not good. Very very quickly, just on the on the, Acceleration points. So I think that the the reason why things were accelerating so we went from a world in which Obviously, Mrs Thatcher was in for a long time, 10 years.\n\nJohn Major was was in for a long time, 7 years. Tony Blair was in for how many years?\n\nSpeaker 0: 10.\n\nSpeaker 1: 10. Right. And then\n\nSpeaker 0: Born by Gordon, 3.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gordon Gordon, 3. But Gordon Brown only finished by an election, Otherwise he would have continued, and then obviously David Cameron in for 6. And so that that that's the norm in British politics, It's the way we sort of think about British politics in the in the modern era. And then suddenly things began to accelerate. I mean obviously Theresa May Did about 2.\n\nBoris Johnson did about 2, and it feels as though Liz Truss is going to be lucky to do a few months. And so why is this? And this is where I I go to you, Alastair, because I think it's the big word that you understand better than anyone. What is the reason why things are accelerating so much?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Brexit?\n\nSpeaker 1: It is Brexit, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think a lot well, I think it's I think it look. It's complicated. I do I really do. I was in Dublin on on Tuesday, and I was I was actually making at a conference. I was speaking about Brexit, and, Definitely, the the view in the room was that Britain has not recovered from Brexit.\n\nThis these were Irish business people. They feel that Britain has just taken a terrible step into an unknown future, and they and we we, Britain, can't work out how to how to manage it. But I think the other thing that's going on, I'm reading a book at the moment by Christopher Wylie. Do you remember Christopher Wylie, the guy who worked for Cambridge Analytica and then became Western Blower. And Yeah.\n\nYeah. That guy. I can say the title of the book in a way I probably couldn't say it on the BBC. It's called mind fuck.\n\nSpeaker 1: Jovian banned from Sky for our for our abusive language.\n\nSpeaker 0: I saw that, but they swear. They say they maybe don't say the f word. But, anyway, we can get by without Sky. We have more people listening to us than watch Sky, Rory. Don't worry about that.\n\nBut and by the way, I'm really sorry, everybody. We have sold out the by that. It's sold out in 7 minutes Yeah. Which is utterly ridiculous.\n\nSpeaker 1: As you can imagine, because Alastair sometimes gets quite confident. He has these moments Confidence. He was trying to tell us the Palladium was too small and we needed to play, what was it, o two Wembley Arena?\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought the o two were Wembley. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Exactly. And now, of course, he's Absolutely convinced to this because the Palladium, which had 2 and a half 1000 seats sold out in 7 minutes.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're the one who keeps talking about Harry Lauder and\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, I I thought well, I mean, because Friend of Harry Harry Lauder, Max Miller, you know, Tony Hancock fan, I think those places are pretty big because, you know, Bob Mankaus didn't always sell out the palladium, so I I thought that was about as good as we could do, but, obviously\n\nSpeaker 0: I wonder if, Boris Johnson will be on that circuit. I see you got a 150,000 for his speech the other day. I I mean, I think people will be quite offended by that. You know? Yeah.\n\nHe's completely screwed the country. He's left us with a total dud. He's got a constituency to run. He's still an MP, And he's he's gone and picked up a $150 for a speech and and then taking his family on holiday.\n\nSpeaker 1: Although although, I think Of all the things that these ex prime ministers do, I mean, Tony Blair also made a lot of money from speaking, and and ex politicians do, It's probably it\n\nSpeaker 0: I can see do, Rory. You do do.\n\nSpeaker 1: We we do. You do? And I can see it's upsetting for people, but it is less bad than than many of the other things they could do. It's much less bad than lobbying, much less bad than taking dodgy jobs.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, it's also, in his case, is much less bad than him being prime minister, so I don't care if he gets $10,000,000 as long as he's never prime minister again.\n\nSpeaker 1: The the question is why does somebody want to pay all that money to him? And that's what surprises me. That's That's\n\nSpeaker 0: a good question. So we were talking about this long, average thing. And Chris Wiley's book, Mind fuck, really does I'm I'm only about a third of the way through. But I I I do think that social media has It's accelerated it's accelerated people's intolerance, and I think it's made people I think politicians Have far less ability to get away with the benefit of the doubt when once they're in power. I think this stuff helps bad guys get into power, But I think once they're in, if there isn't a basic level of competence, I think you're done for quicker.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and and so and I I do say, Roy, there there aren't you know, we used to all laugh about Italy where they changed prime minister every 10 minutes, but I think we are becoming seen as that kind of basket.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, you can completely I mean, well, because Boris Johnson is Burlesconi, basically. Right? And and now, people are Trying to bring in a sort of Mario Draghi figure in the chancellor. They're trying to get a reassuring technocrat to come in, which is what they want.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is is let's trust Georgia Maloney.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, she's she's not yet, but of course, is it round the corner? So I I think the way in which Brexit plays into this isn't just the economics, It's the way in which, Brexit as a manifestation, as you say, of populism and its acceleration in the way that social media accelerates things has driven the Conservative Party because this is a party that from the moment Brexit passed was split, Initially, with the majority of people having voted Remain, then the majority of people having voted Brexit, but completely unreconciled to itself. So Theresa May was Destroyed by the Brexit right of the party. Boris Johnson, many of the people who moved against him were from the remain left of the Conservative Party, which is why many, Boris supporters have never really forgiven that. Liz Truss won on the back of the Brexit Right.\n\nSo she was seen as a Boris Johnson loyalist, and the people who came out immediately against her were mostly on the non Brexit left. There were some exceptions. She put a few remains of cabinet. But basically the Conservative Party is in a civil war, and it's a civil war between the kind of libertarian, almost Trumpian populist right, And the more 1 nation conservatism, which was trying to win votes in the centre ground, which David Cameron came out of. And and this war's been going on, really, un since since my statute went.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think it's more complicated than that. I think you've got the 1 nation, and you've got the libertarians. But I don't think all the populists are necessarily in the same place as Truss's libertarianism. I think that's something that's\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Even more concrete. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nBut yeah. That's right because a lot of the populists I mean, you're right. Boris Johnson was not on the side of what this trust fund did. He, of course, approved these tax rises To balance the budgets. So, and and He he\n\nSpeaker 0: he was obviously part of the anti growth coalition.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that that's what she means. I mean, she's saying since 2008, we've had anaemic growth, And she in that press conference, and she blames it almost entirely on the fact that taxes are too high. Now you you then said, I think, something very important, which is the fundamental question here, which is about whether the public will Where more cuts? And the answer is, of course, they will not. They they really will not.\n\nAnd, although we've had our disagreements, Many disagreements about austerity, and I would actually say that in a way, the way in which Quasi Quoting and Liz Truss blew up the markets and blew up the country is, from my point of view, if you come from my side of politics, A reminder of why people like me believed that being prudent fiscally, being responsible fiscally balancing the budget matters that if you're seen to borrow and spend too much, you can really trash stuff.\n\nSpeaker 0: By the way, just on on our previous arguments about austerity, I think you said last week that The the Labour had no plan to to to bring it down. I think I'm right that the election, the Labour lost. Alastair Darling was talking about reducing it at at half the pace that that that John that Osborne said he was going to do. So I don't think you were quite right on that one, Rory. But we should maybe get we should try and get Gordon and Alistair on and\n\nSpeaker 1: We We should get them on. We want we want them on. We want them on, and we should we should\n\nSpeaker 0: talk we\n\nSpeaker 1: should talk talk through I mean, they definitely were talking about cuts, and they were definitely talking about cuts which were less than the Tory cuts, But they would have fallen in different ways. They were actually talking about cuts that would have gone right across the board. They didn't believe in what George Osborne did, which was to protect the NHS, protect education, and increase spend on international development. They tried to argue that The only fair way to do it would be to reduce spending almost equally across departments. Anyway, and and it would be interesting to play through Or critics' vulgarity whether they had really taken on board, what the impact of those labor cuts would have been if they'd come straight.\n\nYep.\n\nSpeaker 0: Keir Starmer has basically said that Truss is now finished. She's a lame duck, and the only way now for the country to get out to begin to get out of this mess is is to have a general election. Do you think there's any chance of getting a general election?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. There's there's no chance of getting a general election because the only way you can get a general election is for the majority of MPs to vote for a general election, And the conservatives won a very, very big majority in 2019.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Okay. Let me let me let me ask you another way. Is if the conservatives do get rid of Liz trust.\n\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you think that they can really inflict upon the country another leadership change without having a general election?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I I think they can. You think they can? I think they can and they probably will. I mean, I think they they're in a\n\nSpeaker 0: -\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, we've talked about this before - they're in a sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't don't position. I think it's gonna be very difficult for them to win the next election, whatever they do. They're now 30 points behind, And they've blown the only thing that mattered for the Conservative Party because, you know, you and I, completely disagree about whether it was, whether it was, true or not, but there's there's no doubt that a very important part of the conservatives' reputation for 200 Years has been that they were supposed to be the people who were careful with money, who the the cliche was supposed to be, and I I know we disagree about this, but anyway, the The brand, even if it was a fake brand, was meant to be that Labour were sort of nice, generous people who were a bit loose with the cash, and the Tories were nasty people who were careful with the cash. Yeah. So they've blown that.\n\nThey've they've blown that, and so they're gonna be They're\n\nSpeaker 0: they're now nasty and useless.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And and they were supposed to be. That was not meant to be their brand.\n\nSpeaker 0: So thank you. Okay. So here's so here's a question for you. Given that Rishi Sunak Literally, almost word for word predicted what would happen if they if they elected Liz Truss. Okay?\n\nDo you think that might give him the authority to be the person around whom, even those who voted against him, even those who don't like him, to say, right, the only chance, and it's a slim chance, the only chance we have now is to go with a loaded revolver and a glass of whiskey to Trust say, bye bye. You're finished. And here's Rishi Sunak, and he we are electing him anointed. No election. He is the new leader of the party.\n\nHe's a new prime minister. Don't you think that's the only thing they've got left?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I I agree with you, Alastair. If if you and I were advising, that's what you gotta do because the the point is that They're gonna look ridiculous, obviously, having, you know, a 3rd leader in this amount of time. It's it's it it'll be humiliating and mad, and many people will say it's It's completely legitimate. But if you look at the alternative, the alternative for them is much, much worse. They cannot possibly win an election under Liz Truss.\n\nSo long as she remains Prime Minister, it doesn't matter which chance that she brings in, she's not going to reassure the markets. So they will say, I think, ultimately, they'll see the logic, which is they're very unlikely to win the next election, but they have zero chance with Liz Truss, So they might as well roll the dice again. They have at least a 10% chance, maybe, with somebody else.\n\nSpeaker 0: And And if if they if they do Go for an anointing. They don't have to go to the members. The members don't have to endorse that, do they?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, remember with, yes, is the answer. So with Theresa May, because all the other candidates dropped out, this was when she she came in after David Cameron in 2016. Yeah. Andrea Leadsden dropped out. It didn't go to the membership, she just became the prime minister, so if the MPs want to do that they can absolutely do that, but you're right, in the middle of this there's this Very, very strange thing about the members, which is a problem for the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, which is that there is nothing democratic about Paying money to join a political party.\n\nMhmm. Doesn't matter whether you've got a 100,000 members or 500,000 members. It's not democratic. At least the MPs are elected. Right.\n\nThey have some kind of democratic mandate and them MPs voting for a prime minister is the traditional way it happened in Britain. It makes Some kind of democratic sense, but the parties doing it is what produced Jeremy Corbyn, it's what produced Boris Johnson, it's what produces Liz Truss, And it's a very, very bad system.\n\nSpeaker 0: I've already been ticked off in the chat box for the plugging, a BBC podcast. I'm now gonna plug Tortoise because James Harding, you mentioned the membership. He's continuing with his attempts to expose the reality of the conservative party membership. I think he's taken the whole leadership process to judicial review because, of course, he he he, enrolled Archie the tortoise, amongst others, as a member of the conservative party, you've got a vote.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and there's no transparency. They won't reveal what the, I mean, it's extraordinary. I mean, I I was obviously, you know, A conservative party member, but until this very good research done by Tortoise Media, which is a very interesting media company, It wasn't made brutally clear until they started doing it just how dodgy the rules around these parties are. They're completely untransparent. They won't reveal their membership lists.\n\nThey won't tell you how many of their members, and not even British nationals or registered voters. I mean, it's terrifying, Absolutely\n\nSpeaker 0: terrifying. So you're you're so you would like to see, whatever happens next, it is just the MPs who decide?\n\nSpeaker 1: I'd like just the MPs to decide, and I think the only hope for the Conservative Party is to Get rid of Liz Truss because so long as she stays they don't have a chance, bring in somebody and that person would have to come in immediately, Raise taxes, corporation tax, national insurance would have to go up, put some kind of control on spending so we can actually See what happens in a year or 2 with the energy price cap. And if they manage to reassure the markets, if if if if If inflation began coming down, if, because I didn't see it coming down, if interest rates began coming down, And if they actually ran a very, very tight competence ship with a very mature, experienced leader, which I can't see them finding at the moment, They might have a sliver of a chance if Labour did something catastrophic of winning the next election, but I'd I'd put the chance at 10% were the new leader in Xero with Liz Truss.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that's great. That's really showing up a lot. And just just to maybe wrap maybe wrap up with this, On the back of, Liz Truss' press conference, the yield on bonds to be paid in 30 years went up to 4.85% in the\n\nSpeaker 1: Which means the prices to yeah. The the bills have gone down. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: The the value of the pound went down. Yeah. So she did not if that was part of the purpose of the press conference, it was not successful. And one one one of your former colleagues I was talking to said, you just get the feeling now that even if they try really hard, even if they do their best, whatever they do, they don't know how to do it. I think she doesn't know how to do the job.\n\nI think that, Yet again, we've seen the gap between what it takes to be a cabinet minister and what it takes to be prime minister is Utterly enormous. People have no idea how big that gap is.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, because you can hide as a cabinet minister. It's very, very easy to hide. I mean, particularly if you're Trade minister or foreign minister, you get to take photographs in front of flags with dignitaries. You don't really have to deliver on policy, And the prime minister carries carries the count. No.\n\nIt's it's impossible for anybody to know really what it's like to be prime minister, and we need a much better system of testing them. And that's why A loss of the most successful premises seem to have been people who were leaders the opposition before. Yeah. Really helped Tony Blair, helped David Cameron, helped Margaret Thatcher to come in with that experience.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Well, maybe maybe that maybe we should choose the next prime minister by Saeed Devastian and I and doing a a TV program.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I must say I don't know. We should do a talk about this. I'm I'm not completely convinced that the candidates\n\nSpeaker 0: are not sure that will make the brilliant presence. That was a bit of a joke. That was a bit of a joke.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Anyway, I'm I'm glad I'm glad that we were able to do our emergent we pressed the emergency podcast emergency protocol. I I I'd love to I wish we were being filmed so as they could peep people could see exactly what you're wearing, and they they like\n\nSpeaker 1: I can tell tell the listeners. I'm Stark naked. He's dragged me out of the butt, and he's he's admiring my rippling biceps as we speak.\n\nSpeaker 0: Not quite. No cry. We're talking we're talking tweedy 3 piece is what we're talking. And it was lovely to see you, Marie. I think we'll be doing another couple of Podcasts next week so as we can stay right at the top of the charts, selling out big venues, you'll come, you become Max Miller, the Cheeky Cappy, and all will be well in the world, especially once this rotten Tory government is out of power.\n\nSpeaker 1: Great answer on that. Farewell. Speak soon. Bye bye.",
