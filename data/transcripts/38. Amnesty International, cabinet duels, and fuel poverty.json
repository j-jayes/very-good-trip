Right. Welcome back to another episode of The Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell. And me, Rory Stewart. And we've got lots to talk about, Rory. We got the economy. Gordon Brown is back across the airwaves. Oh, you this is interesting. You said you said didn't say Gordon. Normally, you say Gordon. What happened there? Gordon Brown. I'm I'm referring to him by his full name because it's the this is the pompous introduction of the podcast, and thank you for interrupting me. I also wanna talk about politicians and holidays. I wanna talk about Ukraine, and I know you're interested in we haven't really talked about Ukraine much in recent weeks, and I was fascinated by the Amnesty International report and the fallout from it. You and I wanna talk about the Biden administration. This is the 1st real US climate bill that's ever been passed in the 55 years of talking about this. It's about much more than climate, though, isn't it? This is about dealing with inflation. It's about getting the economy going. It's about health care. It's about corporation tax. I mean, there's a big, big, big, big package. 100%. And then I think you wanna do China Taiwan with us? China Taiwan, a bit of Colombia as well. The new president, Petro, is saying that the war on drugs has failed. And I think if we've got time, we should have a little go at, Partygate, and the pathetic attempts by Daker and Dorries to help Johnson get out of the legitimate and inquiring to the fact that he's a liar. And, also, I think we'll do a little bit of, the rest is bingo, a wonderful new game that's been invented by somebody called James Thomas. Now I don't know if you know this. We started the podcast. Do you remember when we started the podcast? We started the podcast in March, didn't we? Correct. And we've said probably too often because we don't like to be smug, but we have emphasized fairly often that it's been a bit of a hit. It's still number 1 in the charts. And I think we've both been we've both been surprised. Let's be honest. We have both been surprised. Yeah. No. I'm astonished. I I had no idea at all that the 2 of us would work in this way.

That's the rest is politics .com. And now, Rory, I think it's probably time to get on with The podcast. Lovely. Let's kick off with the economy then. You you, convinced that we're going into a 10 year global recession, and William Hague and I were both depressed by your relentless predictions about that last week. Can you explain to me what's going on that we do have a prime minister across the airwaves talking about what we need to do to try to deal with this living crisis, but the prime minister left office 12 years ago. And we do have a chancellor talking about these things, but it's the chancellor who is the same person who left office as chancellor 15 years ago, whereas Boris Johnson and Nadim Zahawi vanished off the face of the Earth. Yeah. It's a real problem, isn't it? I mean, it's partly a problem of Classic lame duck problem, isn't it? I mean, how on earth are Boris Johnson not into how we supposed to lay out any economic policy when they know they're gonna be out in 3 months? So it's a it's a really dangerous time. I mean and, of course, this is one of the many arguments that Boris Johnson tried to use to say in was To say it's a difficult time, he tried to say it by talking about the Ukraine war but he would have been actually had a better argument to say, Look, we are going into this very, very difficult economic We need a bit of stability and predictability. And I think if you're the markets looking at Britain at the moment, you simply don't know what's going to happen. And it's very odd for right the way through the next few weeks, people will not know, are taxes going up, or taxes going down, is borrowing going up, or is borrowing going down? Ticket. Are they going to try to get a real radical quick grip on inflation or are they going to let it run? Are they going to control public sector Hey, aren't they? I mean, these are such fundamental questions at a time when the whole global economy is juddering. But, Rory, you you talk about the lame duck thing. And there's Johnson, who I mean, I think it underlines what a terrible mistake it was by the cabinet to force him out, but at the same time allow him to stay for his taxpayer funded holidays and weddings and all the stuff that he's been doing. But Mario Draghi is also a lame duck, And yet Mario Draghi is on a day to day basis trying to address some of these issues as the outgoing prime minister of Italy. Just because the Johnson is not going to be there beyond September 5th doesn't mean he can do nothing. And likewise, Zahawi, I mean, I know you you take you keep talking about Zahawi being a friend of yours and a very distinguished Distinguished member of the conservative party. But, Rory, he came up with the most extraordinary phrase the other day. He he said, he's not On holiday, but he's with his family as they have a holiday. Now, I I can't even begin to unbundle that one. I've been on working holidays. All your holidays are holidays, aren't they, basically? You're actually technically on holiday at the moment, aren't you, Alastair? Technically, yes. So presumably, he's taking an Alastair Campbell style holiday. But what is he doing about the economy? And honestly when you read the the thing about say what you like about Gordon Brown, I know you've said before that actually you think you really admire the way Gordon Brown has conducted himself in his kind of post prime ministerial life. But the I reckon I really do recommend that people dig up the whole piece that he wrote in the in the Observer about the current situation. And he's giving sensible ideas. He's basically saying, look. Okay. You've got the Conservative leadership election going on. That means that either Truss or Sunak is going to be prime minister shortly. They need to sit down with Johnson, with Sahawi, with the Bank of England if need be, and work out a strategy to deal with this. Because if not, We are talking about fuel poverty statistics in our country in a few weeks months' time. Those are utterly terrifying. 50% of children are gonna be in in poverty. It's it's horrifying. And and some of the recent estimates, I mean, typical bill's £3,850 a year. That's the current projection for typical bill. So remember, what's happened is the government's put in a 4 100 pound discount, 150 pound rebate, £650 payment for low income households, but it looks as though what's happening to typical bills is gonna go so far beyond any of the measures the government's yet taken. It's not gonna cover it's not gonna cover the rise at all. And if you've got kids, I mean, some of the the universal credit figures for a family with young kids, You're talking a you're talking about £2.60 a week per child. So we we we're talking about fuel, but inflation rises probably 13% is the latest estimate. That means, obviously, everything that you're buying goes up. Food prices are gonna soar. Clothes prices are gonna soar. So Anybody frozen on a low income is going to be in a tougher and tougher situation. But part of what's happening here is that as we saw in those debates, There is quite unusually a very, very clear economic divide between these 2 candidates. We don't know, actually, Unless we are confident this trust is gonna win, what economic policy is coming out at the end of this? We know what both their economic policies are and they are very, very different. This trust seems to be very unusually for somebody who's meant to be from the right wing of the conservative party basically going for more debt, Higher deficit, higher public spending, and lower taxes. Whereas Rishi Sunak seems to be going for the more traditional, fiscally conservative move of trying to balance the budget. He doesn't want to rack it up, debt and deficit. And he will do those things by actually raising taxes, cutting treasury move, And reducing public spending. So getting to the bottom of this is gonna be critical, and it's a big gamble either way. The point that Gordon Brown the point that Gordon Gordon Brown has been making, is that that's all fine and that's all the politics and the economics to come in related to this leadership relation. But literally within a matter of weeks, millions of families are going to be tipped into poverty, and that is going to have to be addressed before Liz Truss manages to get her tax plans through as well. 1 of our listeners made the an a very interesting observation, I thought. They defined Liz Truss's economic approach as a pound plummeting strategy and suggested that this was maybe all being manipulated by the disaster capitalists till we stand to make another killing like they did on Brexit. And I'm afraid I'm beginning to think that. I do think these people are just disaster capitalists. This have you been following, Rory? I I I tweeted something this morning. Somebody has posted somebody called Matt Prescott has posted on social media All the plans for all the different free ports and charter cities and so forth. I mean, they're taking up a very, very large part of our country where they're going to be freed from the laws of the land. I'm afraid this is the sovereign individual Brexit revolution going on here, Rory. No. I mean, they're not freed from all the laws of the land. You can't go around murdering people that. Right? The the the point is that they have Okay. That they're freed from some of the economic restrictions that I have. Okay. Okay. I accept that was over the top. I should also say, well, you've as as you've reminded me of my my my non perfection on the factual front, I've got to give a bit of rebuttal here just to show that we we're we're prepared to take it. I said last week that if Liz Truss became prime minister, it would be the first time in our history that the monarch and the prime minister would have the same first name. And you remember what I said? Do you remember what I said? You said, I bet you'll find a George somewhere. Well, within literally, within 5 minutes of this bloody podcast going live, Robert Shrimsley of the Financial Times sent me 3, not 1, but 3 examples of prime ministers who shared the name of a monarch. And who what were they? You were right. George Grenville was the prime minister between 17/63 and 17/65 at the time that George the third was in in, was king. George Canning. Now why is George Canning a historical footnote, Rory? Because the duel, great duel that he fought with Castlereagh. The no. George George Canning is a historical footnote in this context because he was the shortest serving prime minister ever. 119 days, he became very, very ill. He was the prime minister at the time of George the 4th in 18/27. And the 3rd one that the wretched Robert Shrimsley dug up was William Lamb aka Lord Melbourne. God blimey. And he was there at the time of William the 4th and subsequently of Queen Victoria. Yeah. And he was, by the way, the last British prime minister to be dismissed by a monarch. He was sacked by his namesake, but then came back under Victoria. So So thank you, Robert Schrimzler. Yes. You are very clever. Yes. Go to the top of the class. Well done. Isn't the Financial Times a great pay? Brilliant. And let's just do a little shout out for George Canning. So Just to remind people, I I get I'm a bit fuzzy on my history, but my memory is that in 18/09, the Castlereagh, who I think was the war minister, And George Canning was then the foreign secretary, so it would be like Liz Truss and Ben Wallace at the moment. Gotten around Hold on. This is this is this is this is 18 years before he became aimed prime minister. Is this right? Yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Long long way back. Yeah. So these 2 are an absolute standoff in what's going on. And they end up getting into a duel. And the happens 6 AM on Putney Heath. Canning had never fired a pistol in his life, so George Canning much more sort of, not not a grand aristocrat in the same way. Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, of course, you know, very fond of him because, of course, he's a relative of mine, had been doing quite doing quite a lot of duelling in the way that duelling the aristocrats did. He'd managed to Try to shoot shoot shoot a girl's guardian in Ireland. They end up on the lawn, firing at each other, And, 1 shot hit a button on Castlereagh's coat. Castlereagh's 2nd struck canning in the thigh after the first two missed. Roy, how do you know this? I tried to look some of this stuff up at KitchenAid. But but hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. How why did you look up George Canning? Well, I'm fascinated by these people. I mean, I think it's absolutely extraordinary that they got managed to get in a I mean, 2 2 cabinet ministers and the same government Going out on the lawn to shoot at each other. But did you know that I was going to raise George Canning? Did I tip you off? No. You did not tip me off that you were gonna raise George Canning. So you've just got this stuff in your head. I'm I'm sort of blown away by this. Well, it's very sweet of you. I mean, the the the truth of the matter is that I it's a bit fuzzy. So what's going to happen is Robert Shrimps is going to come back and say, no. You were wrong. It was Putney Heath in 18/08. And, actually, it didn't. Anyway, I think 1 or other of them then committed suicide eventually. I've told you before where you can't say commit suicide. He ended his own life. It's no longer a crime. Thank you. Back then, it was a crime. Maybe back then, technically, you're okay. But Now you wanted to bring us onto Ukraine from one sort of violence to another. Well, I'll tell you what. I I just think it's you know, last week, we got we actually got I was a bit worried about it, and I know you I think you were as well about the fact that the way that we talked about terrorists and You need to truly understand that they're, you know, they're not all stupid, and they're not evil, and they're not all cowards, and that that, you know, that there's there's something going on there. And I actually was quite pleased. A lot of people said it was the 1st time they'd heard a sort of fairly nuanced discussion. And I just had a similar reaction to some of this stuff that's been doing the rounds about Ukraine and this Amnesty International report. Because the Amnesty International report on Ukraine, has had a lot of coverage A lot of coverage. And the headline in their in their press release was Ukrainian fighting tactics endanger civilians. Military bases set up in residential areas, including schools and hospitals. Attacks have been launched from populated civilian areas. Now it then says, Such violations in no way justify Russia's indiscriminate attacks, which have killed and injured countless civilians. Now The the person who were who heads the Amnesty International operation in Ukraine has resigned. Amnesty International has been Absolutely savaged by the Ukrainian government and others and and indeed by media around the world. And the problem I have with this is that how we of course, you got media there, and media can do their best, But, you know, media can't really get to the truth of these stories, particularly, I think, in wartime. How are we meant to judge these situations and how we're meant to know what is actually going on. We know we can't trust what the Russians say about what they're doing. So I sorta I felt, Felt I'm probably gonna get absolutely savaged by this in certain parts, but I felt a little bit sorry for Amnesty International. It struck me we're trying to do the job that they're meant to do, which is judge the behavior of governments against accepted international standards. And They've done that, and they've been absolutely savaged for it. Well, beef before we get on to the arguments against, because you're completely right. We it is worth exploring why People are so angry but also thinking about what it must have been like for the boss, I guess, at Amnesty International to make that call And how difficult that would have been. So your Ukrainian country director is gonna resign. You know that when you put this report out, you're gonna Condemned around the world. You know that because you're not naive that the Russians are going to immediately use it. The point is the Russians have spent the last Few months saying whenever they've bombed a hospital or anything like that, it's because the Ukrainians are using them as forward operating bases. Yep. And yet you put it out and I think that if nothing else, there are principles there and there's courage there. Now, what's the argument on the other side? The argument on the other side is that the problem with the report is it seems to be blaming the Ukrainians For the fact they're being shelled and there is nothing the Ukrainians are doing, which is breaking international humanitarian law. So if you're from the Ukrainians point of view, you're defending your own territory. You're looking for spaces to put stuff often, actually. Unfortunately, places like schools, hospitals are very good places to garrison your soldiers when you're trying to defend a town. And you're being blamed for the fact that the Russians, who've got far more artillery than you are, are shelling you In your own town, in your own country. But the very the very first paragraph of the Amnesty International, press release says Ukrainian forces have put civilians in harm's way By establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas, including schools and hospitals, as they repel the Russian invasion that began in February, Amnesty International said today. Such tactics violate international humanitarian law and endanger civilians as they turn civilian objects into military targets. So that isn't true. It doesn't violate international humanitarian law, says he, kind of trying to be a bit pompous here. International humanitarian law does not Actually, require the defender to set up their artillery positions outside a civilian residential area and that's particularly not a requirement on somebody who's defending their cities from invasion. So that that's amnesty overstepping. Well, that's a very, very in which case, Rory, that's a very, very big thing for the Amnesty International to do. The The quote then from the the secretary general, Agnes Callamard, is being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law. So they are being absolutely clear that in their view, this breaches international humanitarian law. There's obviously a big disagreement here Because the UN have come out and said or a UN spokesman has come out and said that in their view, it does not break international humanitarian law. Yep. So there's obviously some big I mean, the problem with international humanitarian law is that there aren't it's very difficult to get to the bottom of because it doesn't Operates through courts in exactly the same way as our domestic law does. Listen, Ukraine, just going forward for a second. So The summer is going to be vital the next few months because this is when we're going to expect Russia to do assaults on the southeast and when we're going to expect Ukraine probably So I do counterinsults, take stuff back. 2 things which maybe have been reported a bit in the media, but maybe not enough, which we're thinking about. One of them is the Russians have put one of their really big bases Not actually in a residential area, school or hospital, but in that case, in the largest nuclear plant in Europe. So, that's the Zaporizhzhia plant. And that is really, really dangerous because there is a serious possibility, through something going wrong, that we could end up with a Chernobyl times 3. Yep. Yep. 15, 20000 Russian soldiers being killed, probably 85% of their field army deployed. So the big thing to look for is, Is Putin going to call out a draft? At the moment, he's trying to fight it all with a volunteer army. They're very, very overstretched. If he's really going to try to take Kyiv and push back into Ukraine, he's going to have to do a conscription, which so far he's been reluctant to do because he hasn't wanted to say that it's any more than a a niche special military operation. Mhmm. On the other hand, as I keep saying, I don't think we should underestimate the Russians. I don't think we should get too depending on this. Just one final point on the amnesty thing. I I I I was so fascinated as I went back and read amnesty reports about Ukraine prior to the invasion. Yep. And they and they were pretty negative. Okay. Impunity for torture endemic, gender based violence widespread, Homophobic attacks by groups advocating discrimination. I just wonder if there's a bit of history here that I just don't know, but I I I I think it's a really, really Interesting story, but it sort of just troubled me that we don't because I look at Amnesty International a little bit as well. I know they've got a, you know, small p particular agenda and But at the same time, you do kind of I I sort of do trust them, and I want to trust them. Well, I I think that I mean, they're incredibly important useful organization. The other one, of course, is is Human Rights Watch. You must have had huge experience with these guys when you're at the department of international development. And and in Afghanistan. And, actually, I was I ran a center on human rights in Harvard. So Amnesty and HRW are the 2 really big, the kind of big, big players in the human rights field And they have to do a very difficult job because they are often relying on people who maybe some of them are ex journalists, stringers, NGO activists to get into very dangerous areas of countries in order to produce these reports. And sometimes they get it wrong. One of those organizations produced a report on Western Afghanistan. Again, the reason I was so angry about it, it was a huge attack on the governor of Herat in Western Afghanistan accusing him of Being responsible for a whole series of atrocities, they got it wrong. They got it backwards. A lot of these atrocities have been done by his opponents and their report was used as an excuse To topple him and create what I thought was a very dangerous new move towards a centralized state and I thought provided space for the Taliban. But They are in a very difficult situation and they just I think, I suppose, maybe this is where you're coming from, They have to put those reports out without worrying too much about the political use to which they could be put because, of course, everything they produce is put to a political use. They just have to make sure they've got their facts right. But when you go when you when you go so there's there there are reports for for 2021, lots about torture, gender based violence, And domestic violence remain widespread. Support service for survivors, and measures to combat domestic violence remain sufficient no progress made in ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on combating and preventing violence against women and domestic violence. And it it also You know, this this is what I think happens in in our the way that we now debate things and the way that that Conventions and views, conventional wisdoms become formed. So in in our part of the world and in the States And in most of Europe, Ukraine have become the good guys about everything, and we want to do everything for Ukraine, but then when somebody stands up and says, for example, Or, well, hold on a minute. Like Macron, for example, in relation to the European Union. You know, they've still got to go through all the processes. When you then read this kind of stuff, Not looking at it through the prism of the current conflict, but looking at it through the the prism of a pre conflict lens, You may be getting a a slightly different take. Yeah. Well, that's, of course, one of the reasons why Vladimir Putin was much more confident when he went in because Ukraine had a very bad reputation In a number of ways. As you say those things and the general sense of corruption and oligarchs. And, of course, he did all this polling where he convinced himself The government was unbelievably unpopular. Yet again, I think you are right that Amnesty Human Rights Watch have to be able to put out these reports without seeming to Influence politics. I mean, of course, that brings us to what's been happening in Gaza recently because, of course, nobody gets more fire than These organizations when they try to report on fights in Israel Palestine. So, for example, in the recent conflict, In Gaza, there's been another outbreak, probably the worst outbreak of fighting for more than a year now if people haven't been following it. We've ended up with Situation in which I think 40 have been killed and of those, probably a dozen of them are children in the fighting. And yet again, In all these conflicts, you're into were they co located with Islamic Jihad fighters, Palestine Islamic Jihad fighters? Were some of them killed by misfiring weapons fired by the people in Gaza or were they killed by the Israelis, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. But I think this reporting has got To keep going. And there was some great reporting done actually against us in Iraq and Afghanistan trying to total up the number of casualties in those places. We have to look at that stuff and take it seriously. I also got in real trouble with your friend Johnny Mercer and others for trying to support Investigations into what our soldiers were accused of doing in Iraq. Again, that's very, very sensitive. People feel, you know, our soldiers are out on the ground, They're making difficult decisions and here are a bunch of human rights lawyers pursuing them for what they're doing. But I was dealing with the fact that I had Iraqis that I trusted coming to me And describing very, very clearly and very credibly that they felt that they had been assaulted by British troops. And I felt that it was Absolutely right for those things to be investigated justice because otherwise everything we do is a hypocritical mess. You get I mean, I found this in Iraq. I found myself standing up Saying to Iraqi policemen who'd been torturing people, we don't torture, and then they come back and say, well, look at what you're doing in Abu Ghraib. Yeah. Yeah. No. It it it's but it's it is this sort of lack of nuance. And and I do think one of the the downsides of the The the extent to which in recent years there has been this sense of we care a lot less about human rights than we did, we care a lot less about the rule of law than we did, is it does, It de amplifies our voice when it comes to actually trying to get other governments to be better than they are and and and and and and operate in the way that we we might want them want them to do. But I I I think the the other the other sort of You're talking there about the nuclear annihilation point, which I think I agree is quite is very, very, very scary. But the other the other situation now that I think is developing into something where really you do worry about whether a misunderstanding could just tip into something terrible, and that is Taiwan. Now we talked last week about Nancy Pelosi. I think we were we were talking on the morning that she arrived, Since when, there have been these extraordinary military maneuvers by the Chinese, which I think they said they were gonna go in for a few days. They're they're carrying on. And I still can't quite get to the bottom. I've seen nothing that helps me get to the bottom to answer the question whether this was genuinely a freelance operation by Nancy Pelosi, or whether Joe Biden is Had had signed off on it. Well, maybe maybe that's something to to we'll do something unusual Sure. Maybe go into the break now and return to a bit of China, Taiwan in a second. Cool. Welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell, and we were talking about Taiwan before the break. Yeah. So just just on that, I mean, if people want to get a sense of quite how strange what The Chinese are doing. There's a really good illustration on the New York Times website, 3rd August, which shows the approximate missile paths. And What you can see is these Chinese missile batteries of which there are 1,000 upon 1,000 firing from the land, 2 of them right over the top of Taiwan and falling straight, I don't think 5 missiles straight over the top, falling in the sea behind it And the others bracketing it on the north and the south. So a very, very clear reminder of the reality, which is that China could, I'm afraid, destroy almost all, of the infrastructure in Taiwan with those missiles if it wanted to, and it's just illustrating it with its attacks. One of the things they presumably are trying to do I've always found this whole thing about military maneuvers. I've I've never quite understood. It's a very, very expensive way of of registering your disquiet or something. But it's also showing is it meant to show that their conventional forces have are overwhelmingly superior to Taiwan, even though Taiwan's pretty well armed for a relatively small place. I I think it's pretty I mean, it's absolutely terrifying. But it's also meant to tell the Americans that you should be terrified as well because, you know, we You're gonna come near, and you're gonna be right within our range. Yep. And they dropped them pretty close. I mean, you know, these these are within A few tens of miles to the edge of the Taiwan coast on each side, you would have seen them splashing into the water around. I mean, it's it's the other thing is China has now put new bans on exports to Taiwan. So they've banned the export of sand, which of course is completely vital for concrete cement building. And if you look at the geography, it's very, very difficult resupplying Taiwan. The other thing they've done, of course, is to is to announced that they're no longer going to be cooperating in the same way on matters to do with military and climate. So that's why I I I kind of am a bit Puzzled as to whether I know Nancy Pelosi has got these very long standing views, but she's also quite close to Biden, and it it just seems strange that this Should have happened in the way that it did. So is it like just a sort of swan song where she's kind of saying farewell to the international stage? Or is Joe Biden kind of tacitly saying, this is okay. I just can't work it out. It's very weird because the Biden administration has been briefing very, very clearly that they warned her against it, but she did arrive in a US military jet. Tickets. She thinks it's all about expressing solidarity. The other thing that's happening, which we've talked about in the past, is the way in which Global conflict now feels more and more 19th century. In other words, as a system dominated by the United States begins to disintegrate into a system with many powers, you see these very strange, ambiguous relationships and Ukraine and China Are of course the things that are driving some of this. So you can see Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, being very mild in his language towards China. Why? Well, understandably, because he desperately relies on China to maintain economic sanctions against Russia and he's terrified that they're going to ease up. Ticket. Turkey, on the other hand, Erdogan has put himself back in the center of things because against all the odds, I didn't think he could do it. I was proved completely wrong. He managed to negotiate safe passage for grain out of Ukraine with Turkish ships. He has now Again, done another very interesting move where he was blocking the admission of Finland and Sweden into NATO, but he now seems to have Drop that objection, which you would have thought would irritate the Russians, but at the same time, he's just had his 2nd meeting with Putin in a matter of days Where he seems to be rebranding himself as creating a kind of land bridge to Russia. So these these different players, and this will be repeated, which is going to Turkey, Ukraine, but it will be repeated Fifty times around the world as different people end up with these strangely ambiguous relationships. What do we do with the US? What do we do with Europe? What do we do with China? What do we do with Russia? Often contradicting themselves. This is the sort of foreign policy landscape that Donald Trump was desperate for. It's basically strong guys sitting down and, you know, carving up the world between them and deciding the fate for smaller countries. That's what that's what it's all about. We're so unsuited to it. Well, I'm so unused to it. If we're going to return to this world, we will have to Britain, countries like Britain, will have to Basically double the size of the foreign office. The French foreign office is about twice the size of British foreign office in terms of core diplomatic staff Because suddenly you have to have a really serious embassy in these places to try to negotiate as All these different countries are cutting deals in 7 different directions. How do you think about your own commercial interests? How do you work with the alliances? We didn't have to do that in the past because in the past we could easily line up behind the United States and Europe with a pretty clear single vision. This world, this multipolar world is now really showing its teeth. Well, I I think one of the other many depressing things to be coming out of this Tory leadership election is the the absence of any sense of a clear Post Brexit foreign policy that actually maximizes Britain's strengths. And I know you keep banging on about the the the sort of slimming down of the foreign office, but it It really does matter. And you see, particularly now, when we are gonna be needing to build these alliances, and we just don't have the wherewithal to do it. You you, I'm sure, speak to lots of Current ambassadors. I mean, most of them are tearing their hair out about how much they have to do with the limited resources that they have. By the way, just on China, Rory, there's another really interesting thing I saw. And I can't remember where I saw it now, but there was a piece I read about where on quite a lot of criticism of of the of Xi Jinping for not doing more on Taiwan or whether that's being allowed by the censors as a way of sort of ramping the pressure up. But there there was a whole theme of sort of, you know, this guy talks too much, but he doesn't do enough in relation to Taiwan. Well, that's very, very, very, very dangerous, isn't it? Because if they're allowing that, That's usually being allowed as an excuse to get going, isn't it? That's classic move from all authoritarian regimes. You create a sense that there's a groundswell of demand. I think Vladimir Putin tried to do quite a lot of this in relation to Ukraine, which is to get this illusion that there's a groundswell of demand to act, and then you have to act. On the Conservative leadership, very, very interesting. I mean, very interesting, firstly, that a YouGov poll suggests that Boris Johnson is still ahead of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak in terms of people's views on who they think would be the best to take on Kyrstyne. So who people are is your people or members? No. This is the general population general population, so not not Tory members. 28% of the general population think Johnson would be the best to take on Kiasama compared to slightly less for Truss and Suneck. Actually, I think it's 28% for Truss, 27% for Sunak. But it's also, 53% of Tory voters Still think it was wrong to get rid of Boris Johnson, and only 41% think it's right. So that's more than half the Tory party, at least in this YouGov poll, Thought that getting rid of Boris Johnson was wrong, whereas, of course, 60% of the voters in the country thought it was exactly the right thing to do. Final one, 60% of Tory members think that 2050 Target on carbon neutral should be pushed back compared to 27% of the general population. So again, the way in which the conservative leaders decide to appeal to their right wing base is gonna be very important in determining things like climate. I I thoroughly enjoyed. Well done, those demonstrators who got into the Liz Truss Golf club bores who make up most of the audience and most of the membership, they're telling what they wanna hear. I mean, have you seen this ridiculous, utterly ridiculous The social media video that Prusunac has posted today of him shredding all the EU legislation, Literally putting thousands of pages into a shredder to the sound of to the tune of, Land of Hope and Glory. I mean, it's the most pathetic, Populist bullshit. And I actually think I had a bit of respect for Soonak, and I think you did at the start when he was actually presenting himself as the guy who was gonna call out the the the the hard truths. He's just stopped doing it now. He's just pandering in the same way that that she is. But the climate stuff's terrifying. I mean, look, I'm in France for the moment, and, we we were out the other night talking to these local Farmers that we know who do the the vineyards and the olives and what have you, they were saying that they've never ever ever known this place so dry. They've never been so scared of forest fires. And one of them was saying that he doesn't think he can last another year. He doesn't actually think he can make a living off the land for another year. I mean, I think people in in Britain are beginning to feel this. You very kindly came up, Took photograph of some trees, when he was staying with me and when we were, looking at It wasn't the only reason I went to it. I didn't you you made us so that I I went to your place to take pictures of your trees. Anyway, the sad thing is that some of them have died. I mean, the, the scorching that came out of that very, very Extreme temperature has, of course, been bad, even up in Scotland. And in the United States, for the last 5 years alone, I mean, this is one of the reasons The climate bill has finally got through, the wildfires that everybody's been reporting a great deal, and the crop destruction, which Maybe it's been reported a little less. There's basically now a drought extending from Colorado to California Yeah. Are really making People begin to feel there's an estimate, I think, that the last 5 years have cost the US economy $800,000,000,000, in terms of climate related disasters. I do I do I do so one thing I'd just before we leave the Tories, I I'd I'd like to point out that I thought Mark Drakeford showed real class when Liz Truss having slagged off, Nicola Sturgeon as an attention seeker then said that Mark Drakeford was was like a low energy Jeremy Corbyn. I thought, why is she sort of going around the United Kingdom just insulting people. So, of course, next day, the Welsh media asked Mark Drakeford what he thought of the leadership contenders, and he said, I have nothing to say about either of them. They have They haven't already said about each other. Very good. Very good. No. You're you're right. It's it's it's well, there's been all this stuff on Twitter, isn't it? Where one's one of the things that goes wrong in these leadership things, which is that Both of them are doing so much to attack each other's records and attack each and attack, in fact, the economic policy of the government for the last 3 years. That, yeah, these brilliant things on Twitter where people keep sort of putting forward the leadership candidates as the Labour Party political broadcast against them. Yeah. Okay. So, Alastair, just just just to finish this off, I know you wanted to take us into take us into the bingo, which I'm still Looking forward to finding out what on earth the bingo is. I think our bingo pro you're gonna find out in a minute about the bingo, but I think our bingo players are going to be a little bit disappointed today. You haven't said a lot of the things that you normally say. We did Taiwan. You didn't even mention the semiconductors. Okay. Okay. Get going. The advanced semiconductor chips. That's the key thing. Key thing, remember, 95% advanced semiconductor chips. Somebody's going to suddenly work out that I've got Massive shareholdings in some advanced semiconductor chip industry. Oh god. Rory, you can't say that. I would have to declare that. Oh, I know I've never remembered what I was what I was going to say. Boris Johnson and the dance, if you were getting married at his age I mean, that dancing, did you see it? I don't. Unfortunately, I I don't watch Boris Johnson dancing. That's that's really nice. All over it was all over the interweb. It's is it a bit like an elephant in a tutu? No. He was so he's a one arm dancing. He he he was he was sort of a Very, very, very, very bad attempt at being John Travolta. And then Carrie brought the sun in to kind of try and alleviate the embarrassment. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure you're already selling this. I don't I'm not sure I'm gonna go straight online to have a look at that. Anyway, tell us about the bingo, Alastair. So the bingo, this wonderful, wonderful innovation by somebody called James Thomas. Basically, he's got a little chart and he's posted it on social media, and he suggested to people that they tick off in each episode When when do these things come up? So for example, porridge and bagpipes is up there. Your ring, your wedding ring is there. Me speaking German is a good one. Abba is another good one. Rory describes something as extraordinary. Alastair mentions private schools. Alastair mentions a new European. Rory's special technique for finding things that That that is is mentioned. Me banging on about Nolan principles. And this one, Rory, I just want to come back to this one thing. That's one from you. There's me mentioning there's me mentioning populism, polarization, a post truth. So, Rory, not only did we have about 700 questions this week. We also had more than a 100 suggestions for rest is politics bingo. And what is fascinating It's how they're basically when it's about you, it seems to be about what you how you say things. With me, it's much more about the things themselves. So for you, for example, lots of people saying distinguished has to go on the rest is politics. Big go. Let me push back on that for a minute. Let's come back to that if we may. Let's dig into that a little, And let's lead into that one a bit more. Whereas me, it's you not plugging the pro the the podcast, Northern Ireland Protocol slagging off Eton, Burnley Football Club, Elvis Presley, and where is Grace performing? So the interesting question is, why are there Why are they not picking up on your phrases? I mean, you also have distinctive phrases, but they clearly don't seem to drop into people's minds Quite as much as Maybe you're a better communicator than I am, Rory. Maybe that's the thing. Maybe you're just much less cliched than me. Maybe you just have a freshness of speech, Which doesn't involve returning to the same phrases. I do I do try that. I do try that, but I I think it's really, really interesting. I would have picked up with you. Definitely, I'd have picked up on distinguished. I think I'd deaf somebody has pointed out you saying something nice about Theresa May, but then also me saying something nice about Tony Blair. But I I just think it's it's brilliant that our listeners are now listening so intently that they can do rest is politics bingo and enjoy it. And I'm gonna add in the word definitely from you. I want them to count how many times you say definitely. Absolutely. Definitely. 100 100%. 100% is another one I say a lot. Oh, so well, thank you very much for that extraordinary bingo interlude. Thank you very much for listening to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart. That's the very distinguished Rory Stewart and me, the Elvis Burnley supporting German ABBA singing, Alastair Campbell. Definitely. And just to take you back to the very beginning when we told you about the new Rest is Politics Plus, you can sign up to that at the rest is politics.com.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nRight. Welcome back to another episode of The Restless Politics with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And we've got lots to talk about, Rory. We got the economy. Gordon Brown is back across the airwaves.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you this is interesting. You said you said didn't say Gordon. Normally, you say Gordon. What happened there?\n\nSpeaker 0: Gordon Brown. I'm I'm referring to him by his full name because it's the this is the pompous introduction of the podcast, and thank you for interrupting me. I also wanna talk about politicians and holidays. I wanna talk about Ukraine, and I know you're interested in we haven't really talked about Ukraine much in recent weeks, and I was fascinated by the Amnesty International report and the fallout from it. You and I wanna talk about the Biden administration.\n\nSpeaker 1: This is the 1st real US climate bill that's ever been passed in the 55 years of talking about this.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's about much more than climate, though, isn't it? This is about dealing with inflation. It's about getting the economy going. It's about health care. It's about corporation tax.\n\nI mean, there's a big, big, big, big package.\n\nSpeaker 1: 100%. And then I think you wanna do China Taiwan with us?\n\nSpeaker 0: China Taiwan, a bit of Colombia as well. The new president, Petro, is saying that the war on drugs has failed. And I think if we've got time, we should have a little go at, Partygate, and the pathetic attempts by Daker and Dorries to help Johnson get out of the legitimate and inquiring to the fact that he's a liar. And, also, I think we'll do a little bit of, the rest is bingo, a wonderful new game that's been invented by somebody called James Thomas. Now I don't know if you know this.\n\nWe started the podcast. Do you remember when we started the podcast?\n\nSpeaker 1: We started the podcast in March, didn't we?\n\nSpeaker 0: Correct. And we've said probably too often because we don't like to be smug, but we have emphasized fairly often that it's been a bit of a hit. It's still number 1 in the charts. And I think we've both been we've both been surprised. Let's be honest.\n\nWe have both been surprised.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. I'm astonished. I I had no idea at all that the 2 of us would work in this way.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, whatever the recipe, we are keen to give people more of it, and that's why today we are launching something called The rest is politics plus.

That's the rest is politics .com. And now, Rory, I think it's probably time to get on with The podcast.\n\nSpeaker 1: Lovely.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's kick off with the economy then. You you, convinced that we're going into a 10 year global recession, and William Hague and I were both depressed by your relentless predictions about that last week. Can you explain to me what's going on that we do have a prime minister across the airwaves talking about what we need to do to try to deal with this living crisis, but the prime minister left office 12 years ago. And we do have a chancellor talking about these things, but it's the chancellor who is the same person who left office as chancellor 15 years ago, whereas Boris Johnson and Nadim Zahawi vanished off the face of the Earth.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's a real problem, isn't it? I mean, it's partly a problem of Classic lame duck problem, isn't it? I mean, how on earth are Boris Johnson not into how we supposed to lay out any economic policy when they know they're gonna be out in 3 months? So it's a it's a really dangerous time.\n\nI mean and, of course, this is one of the many arguments that Boris Johnson tried to use to say in was To say it's a difficult time, he tried to say it by talking about the Ukraine war but he would have been actually had a better argument to say, Look, we are going into this very, very difficult economic We need a bit of stability and predictability. And I think if you're the markets looking at Britain at the moment, you simply don't know what's going to happen. And it's very odd for right the way through the next few weeks, people will not know, are taxes going up, or taxes going down, is borrowing going up, or is borrowing going down? Ticket. Are they going to try to get a real radical quick grip on inflation or are they going to let it run?\n\nAre they going to control public sector Hey, aren't they? I mean, these are such fundamental questions at a time when the whole global economy is juddering.\n\nSpeaker 0: But, Rory, you you talk about the lame duck thing. And there's Johnson, who I mean, I think it underlines what a terrible mistake it was by the cabinet to force him out, but at the same time allow him to stay for his taxpayer funded holidays and weddings and all the stuff that he's been doing. But Mario Draghi is also a lame duck, And yet Mario Draghi is on a day to day basis trying to address some of these issues as the outgoing prime minister of Italy. Just because the Johnson is not going to be there beyond September 5th doesn't mean he can do nothing. And likewise, Zahawi, I mean, I know you you take you keep talking about Zahawi being a friend of yours and a very distinguished Distinguished member of the conservative party.\n\nBut, Rory, he came up with the most extraordinary phrase the other day. He he said, he's not On holiday, but he's with his family as they have a holiday. Now, I I can't even begin to unbundle that one. I've been on working holidays.\n\nSpeaker 1: All your holidays are holidays, aren't they, basically? You're actually technically on holiday at the moment, aren't you, Alastair?\n\nSpeaker 0: Technically, yes.\n\nSpeaker 1: So presumably, he's taking an Alastair Campbell style holiday.\n\nSpeaker 0: But what is he doing about the economy? And honestly when you read the the thing about say what you like about Gordon Brown, I know you've said before that actually you think you really admire the way Gordon Brown has conducted himself in his kind of post prime ministerial life. But the I reckon I really do recommend that people dig up the whole piece that he wrote in the in the Observer about the current situation. And he's giving sensible ideas. He's basically saying, look.\n\nOkay. You've got the Conservative leadership election going on. That means that either Truss or Sunak is going to be prime minister shortly. They need to sit down with Johnson, with Sahawi, with the Bank of England if need be, and work out a strategy to deal with this. Because if not, We are talking about fuel poverty statistics in our country in a few weeks months' time.\n\nThose are utterly terrifying. 50% of children are gonna be in in poverty.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's horrifying. And and some of the recent estimates, I mean, typical bill's £3,850 a year. That's the current projection for typical bill. So remember, what's happened is the government's put in a 4 100 pound discount, 150 pound rebate, £650 payment for low income households, but it looks as though what's happening to typical bills is gonna go so far beyond any of the measures the government's yet taken.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's not gonna cover it's not gonna cover the rise at all. And if you've got kids, I mean, some of the the universal credit figures for a family with young kids, You're talking a you're talking about £2.60 a week per child.\n\nSpeaker 1: So we we we're talking about fuel, but inflation rises probably 13% is the latest estimate. That means, obviously, everything that you're buying goes up. Food prices are gonna soar. Clothes prices are gonna soar. So Anybody frozen on a low income is going to be in a tougher and tougher situation.\n\nBut part of what's happening here is that as we saw in those debates, There is quite unusually a very, very clear economic divide between these 2 candidates. We don't know, actually, Unless we are confident this trust is gonna win, what economic policy is coming out at the end of this? We know what both their economic policies are and they are very, very different. This trust seems to be very unusually for somebody who's meant to be from the right wing of the conservative party basically going for more debt, Higher deficit, higher public spending, and lower taxes. Whereas Rishi Sunak seems to be going for the more traditional, fiscally conservative move of trying to balance the budget.\n\nHe doesn't want to rack it up, debt and deficit. And he will do those things by actually raising taxes, cutting treasury move, And reducing public spending. So getting to the bottom of this is gonna be critical, and it's a big gamble either way.\n\nSpeaker 0: The point that Gordon Brown the point that Gordon Gordon Brown has been making, is that that's all fine and that's all the politics and the economics to come in related to this leadership relation. But literally within a matter of weeks, millions of families are going to be tipped into poverty, and that is going to have to be addressed before Liz Truss manages to get her tax plans through as well. 1 of our listeners made the an a very interesting observation, I thought. They defined Liz Truss's economic approach as a pound plummeting strategy and suggested that this was maybe all being manipulated by the disaster capitalists till we stand to make another killing like they did on Brexit. And I'm afraid I'm beginning to think that.\n\nI do think these people are just disaster capitalists. This have you been following, Rory? I I I tweeted something this morning. Somebody has posted somebody called Matt Prescott has posted on social media All the plans for all the different free ports and charter cities and so forth. I mean, they're taking up a very, very large part of our country where they're going to be freed from the laws of the land.\n\nI'm afraid this is the sovereign individual Brexit revolution going on here, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I mean, they're not freed from all the laws of the land. You can't go around murdering people that. Right? The the the point is that they have Okay.\n\nThat they're freed from some of the economic restrictions that I have.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. I accept that was over the top. I should also say, well, you've as as you've reminded me of my my my non perfection on the factual front, I've got to give a bit of rebuttal here just to show that we we're we're prepared to take it. I said last week that if Liz Truss became prime minister, it would be the first time in our history that the monarch and the prime minister would have the same first name.\n\nSpeaker 1: And you remember what I said? Do you remember what\n\nSpeaker 0: I said? You said, I bet you'll find a George somewhere. Well, within literally, within 5 minutes of this bloody podcast going live, Robert Shrimsley of the Financial Times sent me 3, not 1, but 3 examples of prime ministers who shared the name of a monarch.\n\nSpeaker 1: And who what were they?\n\nSpeaker 0: You were right. George Grenville was the prime minister between 17/63 and 17/65 at the time that George the third was in in, was king. George Canning. Now why is George Canning a historical footnote, Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Because the duel, great duel that he fought with Castlereagh.\n\nSpeaker 0: The no. George George Canning is a historical footnote in this context because he was the shortest serving prime minister ever. 119 days, he became very, very ill. He was the prime minister at the time of George the 4th in 18/27. And the 3rd one that the wretched Robert Shrimsley dug up was William Lamb aka Lord Melbourne.\n\nSpeaker 1: God blimey.\n\nSpeaker 0: And he was there at the time of William the 4th and subsequently of Queen Victoria. Yeah. And he was, by the way, the last British prime minister to be dismissed by a monarch. He was sacked by his namesake, but then came back under Victoria. So So thank you, Robert Schrimzler.\n\nYes. You are very clever. Yes. Go to the top of the class. Well done.\n\nIsn't the Financial Times a great pay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Brilliant. And let's just do a little shout out for George Canning. So Just to remind people, I I get I'm a bit fuzzy on my history, but my memory is that in 18/09, the Castlereagh, who I think was the war minister, And George Canning was then the foreign secretary, so it would be like Liz Truss and Ben Wallace at the moment. Gotten around Hold\n\nSpeaker 0: on. This is this is this is this is 18 years before he became aimed prime minister. Is this right?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLong long way back. Yeah. So these 2 are an absolute standoff in what's going on. And they end up getting into a duel. And the happens 6 AM on Putney Heath.\n\nCanning had never fired a pistol in his life, so George Canning much more sort of, not not a grand aristocrat in the same way. Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, of course, you know, very fond of him because, of course, he's a relative of mine, had been doing quite doing quite a lot of duelling in the way that duelling the aristocrats did. He'd managed to Try to shoot shoot shoot a girl's guardian in Ireland. They end up on the lawn, firing at each other, And, 1 shot hit a button on Castlereagh's coat. Castlereagh's 2nd struck canning in the thigh after the first two missed.\n\nSpeaker 0: Roy, how do you know this?\n\nSpeaker 1: I tried to look some of this stuff up at KitchenAid.\n\nSpeaker 0: But but hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. How why did you look up George Canning?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm fascinated by these people. I mean, I think it's absolutely extraordinary that they got managed to get in a I mean, 2 2 cabinet ministers and the same government Going out on the lawn to shoot at each other.\n\nSpeaker 0: But did you know that I was going to raise George Canning? Did I tip you off?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. You did not tip me off that you were gonna raise George Canning.\n\nSpeaker 0: So you've just got this stuff in your head. I'm I'm sort of blown away by this.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's very sweet of you. I mean, the the the truth of the matter is that I it's a bit fuzzy. So what's going to happen is Robert Shrimps is going to come back and say, no. You were wrong. It was Putney Heath in 18/08.\n\nAnd, actually, it didn't. Anyway, I think 1 or other of them then committed suicide eventually.\n\nSpeaker 0: I've told you before where you can't say commit suicide. He ended his own life. It's no longer a crime.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank\n\nSpeaker 0: you. Back then, it was a crime. Maybe back then, technically, you're okay.\n\nSpeaker 1: But Now you wanted to bring us onto Ukraine from one sort of violence to another.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'll tell you what. I I just think it's you know, last week, we got we actually got I was a bit worried about it, and I know you I think you were as well about the fact that the way that we talked about terrorists and You need to truly understand that they're, you know, they're not all stupid, and they're not evil, and they're not all cowards, and that that, you know, that there's there's something going on there. And I actually was quite pleased. A lot of people said it was the 1st time they'd heard a sort of fairly nuanced discussion. And I just had a similar reaction to some of this stuff that's been doing the rounds about Ukraine and this Amnesty International report.\n\nBecause the Amnesty International report on Ukraine, has had a lot of coverage A lot of coverage. And the headline in their in their press release was Ukrainian fighting tactics endanger civilians. Military bases set up in residential areas, including schools and hospitals. Attacks have been launched from populated civilian areas. Now it then says, Such violations in no way justify Russia's indiscriminate attacks, which have killed and injured countless civilians.\n\nNow The the person who were who heads the Amnesty International operation in Ukraine has resigned. Amnesty International has been Absolutely savaged by the Ukrainian government and others and and indeed by media around the world. And the problem I have with this is that how we of course, you got media there, and media can do their best, But, you know, media can't really get to the truth of these stories, particularly, I think, in wartime. How are we meant to judge these situations and how we're meant to know what is actually going on. We know we can't trust what the Russians say about what they're doing.\n\nSo I sorta I felt, Felt I'm probably gonna get absolutely savaged by this in certain parts, but I felt a little bit sorry for Amnesty International. It struck me we're trying to do the job that they're meant to do, which is judge the behavior of governments against accepted international standards. And They've done that, and they've been absolutely savaged for it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, beef before we get on to the arguments against, because you're completely right. We it is worth exploring why People are so angry but also thinking about what it must have been like for the boss, I guess, at Amnesty International to make that call And how difficult that would have been. So your Ukrainian country director is gonna resign. You know that when you put this report out, you're gonna Condemned around the world. You know that because you're not naive that the Russians are going to immediately use it.\n\nThe point is the Russians have spent the last Few months saying whenever they've bombed a hospital or anything like that, it's because the Ukrainians are using them as forward operating bases.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: And yet you put it out and I think that if nothing else, there are principles there and there's courage there. Now, what's the argument on the other side? The argument on the other side is that the problem with the report is it seems to be blaming the Ukrainians For the fact they're being shelled and there is nothing the Ukrainians are doing, which is breaking international humanitarian law. So if you're from the Ukrainians point of view, you're defending your own territory. You're looking for spaces to put stuff often, actually.\n\nUnfortunately, places like schools, hospitals are very good places to garrison your soldiers when you're trying to defend a town. And you're being blamed for the fact that the Russians, who've got far more artillery than you are, are shelling you In your own town, in your own country.\n\nSpeaker 0: But the very the very first paragraph of the Amnesty International, press release says Ukrainian forces have put civilians in harm's way By establishing bases and operating weapons systems in populated residential areas, including schools and hospitals, as they repel the Russian invasion that began in February, Amnesty International said today. Such tactics violate international humanitarian law and endanger civilians as they turn civilian objects into military targets.\n\nSpeaker 1: So that isn't true. It doesn't violate international humanitarian law, says he, kind of trying to be a bit pompous here. International humanitarian law does not Actually, require the defender to set up their artillery positions outside a civilian residential area and that's particularly not a requirement on somebody who's defending their cities from invasion. So that that's amnesty overstepping.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, that's a very, very in which case, Rory, that's a very, very big thing for the Amnesty International to do. The The quote then from the the secretary general, Agnes Callamard, is being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law. So they are being absolutely clear that in their view, this breaches international humanitarian law.\n\nSpeaker 1: There's obviously a big disagreement here Because the UN have come out and said or a UN spokesman has come out and said that in their view, it does not break international humanitarian law.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: So there's obviously some big I mean, the problem with international humanitarian law is that there aren't it's very difficult to get to the bottom of because it doesn't Operates through courts in exactly the same way as our domestic law does. Listen, Ukraine, just going forward for a second. So The summer is going to be vital the next few months because this is when we're going to expect Russia to do assaults on the southeast and when we're going to expect Ukraine probably So I do counterinsults, take stuff back. 2 things which maybe have been reported a bit in the media, but maybe not enough, which we're thinking about. One of them is the Russians have put one of their really big bases Not actually in a residential area, school or hospital, but in that case, in the largest nuclear plant in Europe.\n\nSo, that's the Zaporizhzhia plant. And that is really, really dangerous because there is a serious possibility, through something going wrong, that we could end up with a Chernobyl times 3.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 1: 15, 20000 Russian soldiers being killed, probably 85% of their field army deployed. So the big thing to look for is, Is Putin going to call out a draft? At the moment, he's trying to fight it all with a volunteer army. They're very, very overstretched. If he's really going to try to take Kyiv and push back into Ukraine, he's going to have to do a conscription, which so far he's been reluctant to do because he hasn't wanted to say that it's any more than a a niche special military operation.\n\nMhmm. On the other hand, as I keep saying, I don't think we should underestimate the Russians. I don't think we should get too depending on\n\nSpeaker 0: this. Just one final point on the amnesty thing. I I I I was so fascinated as I went back and read amnesty reports about Ukraine prior to the invasion. Yep. And they and they were pretty negative.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Impunity for torture endemic, gender based violence widespread, Homophobic attacks by groups advocating discrimination. I just wonder if there's a bit of history here that I just don't know, but I I I I think it's a really, really Interesting story, but it sort of just troubled me that we don't because I look at Amnesty International a little bit as well. I know they've got a, you know, small p particular agenda and But at the same time, you do kind of I I sort of do trust them, and I want to trust them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I think that I mean, they're incredibly important useful organization. The other one, of course, is is Human Rights Watch.\n\nSpeaker 0: You must have had huge experience with these guys when you're at the department of international development.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and in Afghanistan. And, actually, I was I ran a center on human rights in Harvard. So Amnesty and HRW are the 2 really big, the kind of big, big players in the human rights field And they have to do a very difficult job because they are often relying on people who maybe some of them are ex journalists, stringers, NGO activists to get into very dangerous areas of countries in order to produce these reports. And sometimes they get it wrong. One of those organizations produced a report on Western Afghanistan.\n\nAgain, the reason I was so angry about it, it was a huge attack on the governor of Herat in Western Afghanistan accusing him of Being responsible for a whole series of atrocities, they got it wrong. They got it backwards. A lot of these atrocities have been done by his opponents and their report was used as an excuse To topple him and create what I thought was a very dangerous new move towards a centralized state and I thought provided space for the Taliban. But They are in a very difficult situation and they just I think, I suppose, maybe this is where you're coming from, They have to put those reports out without worrying too much about the political use to which they could be put because, of course, everything they produce is put to a political use. They just have to make sure they've got their facts right.\n\nSpeaker 0: But when you go when you when you go so there's there there are reports for for 2021, lots about torture, gender based violence, And domestic violence remain widespread. Support service for survivors, and measures to combat domestic violence remain sufficient no progress made in ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on combating and preventing violence against women and domestic violence. And it it also You know, this this is what I think happens in in our the way that we now debate things and the way that that Conventions and views, conventional wisdoms become formed. So in in our part of the world and in the States And in most of Europe, Ukraine have become the good guys about everything, and we want to do everything for Ukraine, but then when somebody stands up and says, for example, Or, well, hold on a minute. Like Macron, for example, in relation to the European Union.\n\nYou know, they've still got to go through all the processes. When you then read this kind of stuff, Not looking at it through the prism of the current conflict, but looking at it through the the prism of a pre conflict lens, You may be getting a a slightly different take.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, that's, of course, one of the reasons why Vladimir Putin was much more confident when he went in because Ukraine had a very bad reputation In a number of ways. As you say those things and the general sense of corruption and oligarchs. And, of course, he did all this polling where he convinced himself The government was unbelievably unpopular. Yet again, I think you are right that Amnesty Human Rights Watch have to be able to put out these reports without seeming to Influence politics.\n\nI mean, of course, that brings us to what's been happening in Gaza recently because, of course, nobody gets more fire than These organizations when they try to report on fights in Israel Palestine. So, for example, in the recent conflict, In Gaza, there's been another outbreak, probably the worst outbreak of fighting for more than a year now if people haven't been following it. We've ended up with Situation in which I think 40 have been killed and of those, probably a dozen of them are children in the fighting. And yet again, In all these conflicts, you're into were they co located with Islamic Jihad fighters, Palestine Islamic Jihad fighters? Were some of them killed by misfiring weapons fired by the people in Gaza or were they killed by the Israelis, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nBut I think this reporting has got To keep going. And there was some great reporting done actually against us in Iraq and Afghanistan trying to total up the number of casualties in those places. We have to look at that stuff and take it seriously. I also got in real trouble with your friend Johnny Mercer and others for trying to support Investigations into what our soldiers were accused of doing in Iraq. Again, that's very, very sensitive.\n\nPeople feel, you know, our soldiers are out on the ground, They're making difficult decisions and here are a bunch of human rights lawyers pursuing them for what they're doing. But I was dealing with the fact that I had Iraqis that I trusted coming to me And describing very, very clearly and very credibly that they felt that they had been assaulted by British troops. And I felt that it was Absolutely right for those things to be investigated justice because otherwise everything we do is a hypocritical mess. You get I mean, I found this in Iraq. I found myself standing up Saying to Iraqi policemen who'd been torturing people, we don't torture, and then they come back and say, well, look at what you're doing in Abu Ghraib.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. No. It it it's but it's it is this sort of lack of nuance. And and I do think one of the the downsides of the The the extent to which in recent years there has been this sense of we care a lot less about human rights than we did, we care a lot less about the rule of law than we did, is it does, It de amplifies our voice when it comes to actually trying to get other governments to be better than they are and and and and and and operate in the way that we we might want them want them to do.\n\nBut I I I think the the other the other sort of You're talking there about the nuclear annihilation point, which I think I agree is quite is very, very, very scary. But the other the other situation now that I think is developing into something where really you do worry about whether a misunderstanding could just tip into something terrible, and that is Taiwan. Now we talked last week about Nancy Pelosi. I think we were we were talking on the morning that she arrived, Since when, there have been these extraordinary military maneuvers by the Chinese, which I think they said they were gonna go in for a few days. They're they're carrying on.\n\nAnd I still can't quite get to the bottom. I've seen nothing that helps me get to the bottom to answer the question whether this was genuinely a freelance operation by Nancy Pelosi, or whether Joe Biden is\n\nSpeaker 1: Had had signed off on it. Well, maybe maybe that's something to to we'll do something unusual Sure. Maybe go into the break now and return to a bit of China, Taiwan in a second.\n\nSpeaker 0: Cool.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome back to the Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell, and we were talking about Taiwan before the break.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So just just on that, I mean, if people want to get a sense of quite how strange what The Chinese are doing. There's a really good illustration on the New York Times website, 3rd August, which shows the approximate missile paths. And What you can see is these Chinese missile batteries of which there are 1,000 upon 1,000 firing from the land, 2 of them right over the top of Taiwan and falling straight, I don't think 5 missiles straight over the top, falling in the sea behind it And the others bracketing it on the north and the south. So a very, very clear reminder of the reality, which is that China could, I'm afraid, destroy almost all, of the infrastructure in Taiwan with those missiles if it wanted to, and it's just illustrating it with its attacks.\n\nSpeaker 0: One of the things they presumably are trying to do I've always found this whole thing about military maneuvers. I've I've never quite understood. It's a very, very expensive way of of registering your disquiet or something. But it's also showing is it meant to show that their conventional forces have are overwhelmingly superior to Taiwan, even though Taiwan's pretty well armed for a relatively small place. I I\n\nSpeaker 1: think it's pretty I mean, it's absolutely terrifying.\n\nSpeaker 0: But it's also meant to tell the Americans that you should be terrified as well because, you know, we You're gonna come near, and you're gonna be right within our range.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. And they dropped them pretty close. I mean, you know, these these are within A few tens of miles to the edge of the Taiwan coast on each side, you would have seen them splashing into the water around. I mean, it's it's the other thing is China has now put new bans on exports to Taiwan. So they've banned the export of sand, which of course is completely vital for concrete cement building.\n\nAnd if you look at the geography, it's very, very difficult resupplying Taiwan.\n\nSpeaker 0: The other thing they've done, of course, is to is to announced that they're no longer going to be cooperating in the same way on matters to do with military and climate. So that's why I I I kind of am a bit Puzzled as to whether I know Nancy Pelosi has got these very long standing views, but she's also quite close to Biden, and it it just seems strange that this Should have happened in the way that it did. So is it like just a sort of swan song where she's kind of saying farewell to the international stage? Or is Joe Biden kind of tacitly saying, this is okay. I just can't work it out.\n\nIt's very\n\nSpeaker 1: weird because the Biden administration has been briefing very, very clearly that they warned her against it, but she did arrive in a US military jet. Tickets. She thinks it's all about expressing solidarity. The other thing that's happening, which we've talked about in the past, is the way in which Global conflict now feels more and more 19th century. In other words, as a system dominated by the United States begins to disintegrate into a system with many powers, you see these very strange, ambiguous relationships and Ukraine and China Are of course the things that are driving some of this.\n\nSo you can see Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, being very mild in his language towards China. Why? Well, understandably, because he desperately relies on China to maintain economic sanctions against Russia and he's terrified that they're going to ease up. Ticket. Turkey, on the other hand, Erdogan has put himself back in the center of things because against all the odds, I didn't think he could do it.\n\nI was proved completely wrong. He managed to negotiate safe passage for grain out of Ukraine with Turkish ships. He has now Again, done another very interesting move where he was blocking the admission of Finland and Sweden into NATO, but he now seems to have Drop that objection, which you would have thought would irritate the Russians, but at the same time, he's just had his 2nd meeting with Putin in a matter of days Where he seems to be rebranding himself as creating a kind of land bridge to Russia.\n\nSpeaker 0: So\n\nSpeaker 1: these these different players, and this will be repeated, which is going to Turkey, Ukraine, but it will be repeated Fifty times around the world as different people end up with these strangely ambiguous relationships. What do we do with the US? What do we do with Europe? What do we do with China? What do we do with Russia?\n\nOften contradicting themselves.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is the sort of foreign policy landscape that Donald Trump was desperate for. It's basically strong guys sitting down and, you know, carving up the world between them and deciding the fate for smaller countries. That's what that's what it's all about.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're so unsuited to it. Well, I'm so unused to it. If we're going to return to this world, we will have to Britain, countries like Britain, will have to Basically double the size of the foreign office. The French foreign office is about twice the size of British foreign office in terms of core diplomatic staff Because suddenly you have to have a really serious embassy in these places to try to negotiate as All these different countries are cutting deals in 7 different directions. How do you think about your own commercial interests?\n\nHow do you work with the alliances? We didn't have to do that in the past because in the past we could easily line up behind the United States and Europe with a pretty clear single vision. This world, this multipolar world is now really showing its teeth.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I think one of the other many depressing things to be coming out of this Tory leadership election is the the absence of any sense of a clear Post Brexit foreign policy that actually maximizes Britain's strengths. And I know you keep banging on about the the the sort of slimming down of the foreign office, but it It really does matter. And you see, particularly now, when we are gonna be needing to build these alliances, and we just don't have the wherewithal to do it. You you, I'm sure, speak to lots of Current ambassadors. I mean, most of them are tearing their hair out about how much they have to do with the limited resources that they have.\n\nBy the way, just on China, Rory, there's another really interesting thing I saw. And I can't remember where I saw it now, but there was a piece I read about where on quite a lot of criticism of of the of Xi Jinping for not doing more on Taiwan or whether that's being allowed by the censors as a way of sort of ramping the pressure up. But there there was a whole theme of sort of, you know, this guy talks too much, but he doesn't do enough in relation to Taiwan.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's very, very, very, very dangerous, isn't it? Because if they're allowing that, That's usually being allowed as an excuse to get going, isn't it? That's classic move from all authoritarian regimes. You create a sense that there's a groundswell of demand. I think Vladimir Putin tried to do quite a lot of this in relation to Ukraine, which is to get this illusion that there's a groundswell of demand to act, and then you have to act.\n\nOn the Conservative leadership, very, very interesting. I mean, very interesting, firstly, that a YouGov poll suggests that Boris Johnson is still ahead of Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak in terms of people's views on who they think would be the best to take on Kyrstyne.\n\nSpeaker 0: So who people are is your\n\nSpeaker 1: people or members? No. This is the general population general population, so not not Tory members. 28% of the general population think Johnson would be the best to take on Kiasama compared to slightly less for Truss and Suneck. Actually, I think it's 28% for Truss, 27% for Sunak.\n\nBut it's also, 53% of Tory voters Still think it was wrong to get rid of Boris Johnson, and only 41% think it's right. So that's more than half the Tory party, at least in this YouGov poll, Thought that getting rid of Boris Johnson was wrong, whereas, of course, 60% of the voters in the country thought it was exactly the right thing to do. Final one, 60% of Tory members think that 2050 Target on carbon neutral should be pushed back compared to 27% of the general population. So again, the way in which the conservative leaders decide to appeal to their right wing base is gonna be very important in determining things like climate.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I thoroughly enjoyed. Well done, those demonstrators who got into the Liz Truss Golf club bores who make up most of the audience and most of the membership, they're telling what they wanna hear. I mean, have you seen this ridiculous, utterly ridiculous The social media video that Prusunac has posted today of him shredding all the EU legislation, Literally putting thousands of pages into a shredder to the sound of to the tune of, Land of Hope and Glory. I mean, it's the most pathetic, Populist bullshit. And I actually think I had a bit of respect for Soonak, and I think you did at the start when he was actually presenting himself as the guy who was gonna call out the the the the hard truths.\n\nHe's just stopped doing it now. He's just pandering in the same way that that she is. But the climate stuff's terrifying. I mean, look, I'm in France for the moment, and, we we were out the other night talking to these local Farmers that we know who do the the vineyards and the olives and what have you, they were saying that they've never ever ever known this place so dry. They've never been so scared of forest fires.\n\nAnd one of them was saying that he doesn't think he can last another year. He doesn't actually think he can make a living off the land for another year.\n\nSpeaker 1: I mean, I think people in in Britain are beginning to feel this. You very kindly came up, Took photograph of some trees, when he was staying with me and when we were, looking at\n\nSpeaker 0: It wasn't the only reason I went to it. I didn't you you made us so that I I went to your place to take pictures of your trees.\n\nSpeaker 1: Anyway, the sad thing is that some of them have died. I mean, the, the scorching that came out of that very, very Extreme temperature has, of course, been bad, even up in Scotland. And in the United States, for the last 5 years alone, I mean, this is one of the reasons The climate bill has finally got through, the wildfires that everybody's been reporting a great deal, and the crop destruction, which Maybe it's been reported a little less. There's basically now a drought extending from Colorado to California\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are really making People begin to feel there's an estimate, I think, that the last 5 years have cost the US economy $800,000,000,000, in terms of climate related disasters.\n\nSpeaker 0: I do I do I do so one thing I'd just before we leave the Tories, I I'd I'd like to point out that I thought Mark Drakeford showed real class when Liz Truss having slagged off, Nicola Sturgeon as an attention seeker then said that Mark Drakeford was was like a low energy Jeremy Corbyn. I thought, why is she sort of going around the United Kingdom just insulting people. So, of course, next day, the Welsh media asked Mark Drakeford what he thought of the leadership contenders, and he said, I have nothing to say about either of them. They have They haven't already said about each other.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Very good. No. You're you're right. It's it's it's well, there's been all this stuff on Twitter, isn't it?\n\nWhere one's one of the things that goes wrong in these leadership things, which is that Both of them are doing so much to attack each other's records and attack each and attack, in fact, the economic policy of the government for the last 3 years. That, yeah, these brilliant things on Twitter where people keep sort of putting forward the leadership candidates as the Labour Party political broadcast against them.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So, Alastair, just just just to finish this off, I know you wanted to take us into take us into the bingo, which I'm still Looking forward to finding out what on earth the bingo is.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think our bingo pro you're gonna find out in a minute about the bingo, but I think our bingo players are going to be a little bit disappointed today. You haven't said a lot of the things that you normally say. We did Taiwan. You didn't even mention the semiconductors.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Get going. The advanced semiconductor chips. That's the key thing.\n\nKey thing, remember, 95% advanced semiconductor chips. Somebody's going to suddenly work out that I've got Massive shareholdings in some advanced semiconductor chip industry.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh god. Rory, you can't say that. I would have to declare that. Oh, I know I've never remembered what I was what I was going to say. Boris Johnson and the dance, if you were getting married at his age I mean, that dancing, did you see it?\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't. Unfortunately, I I don't watch Boris Johnson dancing. That's that's really nice.\n\nSpeaker 0: All over it was all over the interweb.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's is it a bit like an elephant in a tutu? No.\n\nSpeaker 0: He was so he's a one arm dancing. He he he was he was sort of a Very, very, very, very bad attempt at being John Travolta. And then Carrie brought the sun in to kind of try and alleviate the embarrassment.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure you're already selling this. I don't I'm not sure I'm gonna go straight online to have a look at that. Anyway, tell us about the bingo, Alastair.\n\nSpeaker 0: So the bingo, this wonderful, wonderful innovation by somebody called James Thomas. Basically, he's got a little chart and he's posted it on social media, and he suggested to people that they tick off in each episode When when do these things come up? So for example, porridge and bagpipes is up there. Your ring, your wedding ring is there. Me speaking German is a good one.\n\nAbba is another good one. Rory describes something as extraordinary. Alastair mentions private schools. Alastair mentions a new European. Rory's special technique for finding things that That that is is mentioned.\n\nMe banging on about Nolan principles. And this one, Rory, I just want to come back to this one thing. That's one from you. There's me mentioning there's me mentioning populism, polarization, a post truth. So, Rory, not only did we have about 700 questions this week.\n\nWe also had more than a 100 suggestions for rest is politics bingo. And what is fascinating It's how they're basically when it's about you, it seems to be about what you how you say things. With me, it's much more about the things themselves. So for you, for example, lots of people saying distinguished has to go on the rest is politics. Big go.\n\nLet me push back on that for a minute. Let's come back to that if we may. Let's dig into that a little, And let's lead into that one a bit more. Whereas me, it's you not plugging the pro the the podcast, Northern Ireland Protocol slagging off Eton, Burnley Football Club, Elvis Presley, and where is Grace performing?\n\nSpeaker 1: So the interesting question is, why are there Why are they not picking up on your phrases? I mean, you also have distinctive phrases, but they clearly don't seem to drop into people's minds Quite as much as\n\nSpeaker 0: Maybe you're a better communicator than I am, Rory. Maybe that's the thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe you're just much less cliched than me. Maybe you just have a freshness of speech, Which doesn't involve returning to the same phrases.\n\nSpeaker 0: I do I do try that. I do try that, but I I think it's really, really interesting. I would have picked up with you. Definitely, I'd have picked up on distinguished. I think I'd deaf somebody has pointed out you saying something nice about Theresa May, but then also me saying something nice about Tony Blair.\n\nBut I I just think it's it's brilliant that our listeners are now listening so intently that they can do rest is politics bingo and enjoy it.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'm gonna add in the word definitely from you. I want them to count how many times you say definitely.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Definitely. 100 100%. 100% is another one I say a lot.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so well, thank you very much for that extraordinary bingo interlude. Thank you very much for listening to The Restless Politics with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's the very distinguished Rory Stewart and me, the Elvis Burnley supporting German ABBA singing, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Definitely.\n\nSpeaker 0: And just to take you back to the very beginning when we told you about the new Rest is Politics Plus, you can sign up to that at the rest is politics.com.",
