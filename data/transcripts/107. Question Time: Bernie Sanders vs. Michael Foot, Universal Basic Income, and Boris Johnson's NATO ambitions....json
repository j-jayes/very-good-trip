Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. So, Alastair, to start us off, we've got a lovely question from Ellie Scott, who asks, Share your best memories of Betty Boothroyd. And for listeners who haven't heard, Betty Boothroyd has died this week. So Alastair. So Betty, Yorkshire born Juspry, she was a Tiller girl, famously, a dancer, and became an MP for West Bromwich, and she was the first ever Woman, speaker of the House of Commons, 1st female speaker of the House of Commons, labor to her core, but I think hugely respected as a as a speaker Speaker, and, of course, became one of the most famous speakers because it coincided with, with television cameras being allowed into parliament. She wasn't the 1st TV speaker, but she was the 1st that was there for quite a long time. And she was a lovely, lovely, lovely woman. If I had, I think you've had 1 2 memories, actually, that popped into my head when people said that on the day she died. The first was, I remember During the period when I was really under the cosh, in number 10 when the I felt like, you know, the the Tories were after me. The media were after me the whole time. Quite a few people Or on our own side, we're sort of thinking, oh, isn't it about time we sort of chopped his head off? And I and I got a phone call from the speaker's secretary saying, The speaker wonders if you'd like to pop in for a cup of tea, which happened periodically. And so I thought, oh god. Not Betty as well. It's gonna be sort of, you know, Gagging up on me. And I went there, and we sat down, and we had a cup of tea, and we dunked our digestive biscuits, and She could not have been nicer, and she just said, listen. You're getting a lot of grief. You're getting a lot of flack, but I just hope you understand that the reason you're getting it is because This lot is scared of you, and they they know that you're doing a good job for Tony, and that's your job, and that's what you what you gotta keep doing. And so little acts like that. And then the other really powerful memory, she got involved in the People's Vote campaign, and I just remember the first time and, obviously, a lot of the the the campaign was full of young volunteers, and most of them well, they weren't born when Betty was kind of, you know, on the TV the whole time. And she came along and she did this speech, and there were these young people behind her. You can get a film of this. There's young people on the stage behind her. And you could see the impact that she was having as she told her story of why Europe mattered so much to her, and she'd been to Germany after to the war, and she'd made some German friends. And the last time I spoke to her, I said this on the main podcast, the last time I spoke to her is when she phoned me up to that Radio 4 debate I did with Jacob Rees Mogg, and so I can honestly say I don't know what her actual last words were, But I can say that her last words to me were, I will not stop. I will never give up on the dream that we'll one day be back in the European Union because this is an absolute, a total unmitigated disaster. So I will take that with me as inspiration going forward. Lovely. Now time for you to ask me a question. Mel Griffiths, How long did it take you to stop laughing when you heard that Boris Johnson is hoping to be appointed NATO secretary general? And you same theme, my dog, Bert. Do you think Boris Johnson seriously thinks he has a chance to become head of NATO? Isn't it common knowledge that he's taken Russian money, visited banga banga parties where they obtained Kompromat, and put an ex KGB son in his House of Lords and also sat on the Russia report. Well, it's it's it's staggering, isn't it? He would be the most unsuitable head of NATO imaginable. I mean, that's a job which has generally gone to quite For serious people who work collegially, who focus on the details of defence expenditure, it would be a great honour If Britain were to get that job, it's been a a long time since since, actually George Roberson. George Roberson. Yeah. Was and who did a very good job and was a very respected Yeah. That is secretary general who'd been the labor minister. So Britain's been hoping to get that job back for a very long time. I know there was There's been talk about Mark Sedwell. He's the, ex cabinet secretary, was in the running for it. Some people think Ben Wallace Might be in the running for it, but I would have thought Boris Johnson would be short of making him the abbot of a Trappist monastery. It would be difficult to find a worse job. I I also think that at the weekend, because the only thing about NATO is that that position is decided by The heads of government, essentially. And I think the most important head of government in relation to NATO is the president of America. And this little mini campaign Johnson was running coincided with the revelation in one of the Sunday newspapers that when he was discussing the protocol issues with some of his colleagues, and somebody said, well, the Americans, we've got to do this to please the Americans. He said, fuck the Americans. So I'm not sure that will help him either. More serious one, Rory, Nigel McFeat, which is the better option? For Ukraine to employ the might of NATO military hardware To completely push Russia out of all Ukraine and so risk World War 3, or for Ukraine to cede Crimea and Donbas in return for Russian troop withdrawal from remaining areas, and so avert World War 3? Well, it's it's it's a good question, and it's one that people have gotta keep asking because Obviously, the consensus now with the West US and its allies articulated by Fiona Hill, who I hope people have a chance to listen to on our Our leading podcast She was good, wasn't she? She she was very serious, very interesting, and worth worth definitely listening to. And for people who don't know, she's probably the leading Russia expert In and around the US government. Anyway, the conventional wisdom is no appeasement, no compromise, Arm Ukraine to the teeth and fight until Russia withdraws back to its pre 2014 borders, including giving back Crimea. But at the same time, We just can't get into that lazily. There's a lot to be said for it. It's absolutely true that Putin, unless he's contained, is A horrifying authoritarian dictator who will want to get his teeth into the Baltic and expand Russia in every direction. It's also true that if we don't stand up to him in Ukraine, China and other countries we tempted to screw around elsewhere. So I think we're on the right policy, but we've got to keep asking ourselves whether there is a route to peace. And in the end, peace does involve compromise. We're just not ready to get there yet. And one the one one of the things that Fiona Hill said was Is she worried that this becomes like a kind of Iran Iraq, just sort of grinds on? But I don't believe that the Western democracies will keep Supporting it to the extent that they have been, which I think we both agree has been impressive, albeit with some sort of hesitancy and some sort of slowness in response at times. But, ultimately, you're talking about a country here that's being being destroyed. And Russia, we've said this so many times, Putin is not going to give up. He's the only person who actually could call this off, and he's unlikely to. And it feels like a sort of stalemate at the moment. It feels militarily like a stalemate. But how long can that go on, and how long can people keep saying, well, we have to just keep arming them more and more. That's where I would like to be, but I I I fear that, There was a big demonstration in in Germany at the weekend. The hard right in America, the sort of Trumpians are becoming very kinda critical of Biden on continuing to sort of Put so much into this. So the politics are not gonna get easier. Yeah. It's not gonna get easier. I think we both agree that the policy at the moment is correct. It was correct To get in behind Ukraine, it was right to challenge Russia, it's right to arm Ukraine, but it's also true that I've noticed over kind of 30 years in and out of Foreign policy stuff that the West often gets overly optimistic. I remember in 2014, everybody predicting that Putin would be crushed by sanctions in 6 months. I remember people predicting in 2011 that Bashar al Assad could only last 6 months. I remember You'll remember people predicting that, you know, Osama bin Laden would die of kidney failure. I mean, there's a lot of of what what's called optimism bias in this stuff, Now I think Fiona Hill is more likely to be right that this is gonna grind on for a long time, and it's gonna test our democracy's limit. Here's a question for you from Evan Shawcross. I was listening to the Question Time episode last week when you got into conspiracy theories as well as dealing with grief. And I was wondering, Alastair, if If either of you have lost someone who were close because they changed their beliefs, Evan Shawcross. I, for example, am attempting To deal with the way in which my father has fallen completely down the conspiracy rabbit hole. We can no longer talk about anything because of his obsession over vaccines, scenes among other things. Have you experienced anything like this at all? What would you advise people to do? Try and change their views, cut them out? God. That that's because normally am I wrong about this? Isn't it normally that it's older people who are worrying with about younger people having conspiracy Here is proof I got that wrong. This is a younger person saying that their elderly parent Has got into this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I find that quite difficult. I must be honest. I think all you can do is do you try and persuade them? I don't know if you try and persuade them. I think you try and love them. And, if you think they're at the end towards the end of their life, I think you just try and, I don't know. It's that's a tough one. That's a tough one. It's a very tough one. And I guess because I think one of the things that seems to happen in my experience, particularly with men as they get older, is that their minds become Much more rigid. And and I think it is a question of Not us, Rory? Not us. Thank goodness. No. No. Not us. Thank But it's sort of getting people onto another track, working out how you have the techniques to sort of move on. But the problem is for Evan's dad, I guess, this question around his obsession over vaccines will be more important to him than almost anything else, and he'll be reluctant to sort of move on And talk about something else, and he'll sense that his son isn't taking him seriously. So it must be very difficult. I think in those circumstances, I would do my level best to try and park it, but that's quite difficult. Okay. UBI, universal basic income. Andrew Oliver Riley. Be interested to hear your thoughts on universal basic income. Broadly in favor until you actually try to look at the detail of how it would be done. So in my case, I'm very, very much in favor of cash. Obviously, that's what GiveDirectly, the charity I work with, does in Africa. I'm particularly interested actually in the impact of one time payments which can transform people's lives if done at the right level, one time cash payments. And in Africa, because the levels of poverty, a dollar there is like a kind of $200 in the United States and $550 can make a transformatory difference to someone's life. Obviously, to some extent, our welfare states are based on the assumption that we should be providing cash support to make sure that people can meet their basic needs. The question is Whether we're adequately doing that and whether the best way to do that is to make it universal as opposed to targeted on the very poorest. Ed Miliband's, book, Go Big, Has a lot on this, which is is worth worth a read. Are you are you missing him? Do you think he should be the intellectual powerhouse to the new labor movement? But he's he's he's part of the Shelley cabinet, and he's doing the big green stuff. Yep. I think Ed has, has grown out of leadership as it were. Ticket. Into into a new position. Yeah. Here's here's a weird question for you. Sam Wiltshire, as a youngish Aussie that moved to the UK in 2010, I don't understand why Margaret Thatcher She's constantly referred to as Mrs. Thatcher, whereas all other prime ministers are more often referred to as John Major or just Cameron. How come she has that distinction compared to Britain's other former prime ministers? You know, he says that's true, isn't it? I remember getting in real trouble from my constituency. When I first Address them. I would refer to her as Thatcher, and they would get very, very, very angry conservative association members. They thought it was deeply disrespectful. I think I think there's 2 things here. The first thing, I I tend to call her missus Thatcher, whereas I would not say mister Wilson or mister Major. Or even missus May. You don't say missus May, do you? No. I'd say I'd say Theresa May, I think, or I'd say May. Yeah. I think there is a sort of, This is back to the thing. I had the one of those terrible you know, it's the old thing about am I the only person who when I sit on a tube, I'm sitting there on the tube and and a woman gets up, And and I was just conditioned as a child that you you stand up for a woman. Okay? Yeah. So but now I'm sort of And I'm very reluctant because I think if I stand up, I'm basically saying to them, I think you're older and less fit than I am. That's good. Yeah. Yeah. But the same politeness Yeah. Is, I think, what partly drives us calling her missus Thatcher. Don't forget as well, I think Thatcher became people define her as Thatcher in a very negative, aggressive, hateful way. It rhymed, amongst other things, with milk snatcher. Share. Yeah. Whereas whereas with Cameron, I don't think when people say Cameron, they're saying Cameron, that awful person. They're just saying Cameron, who was the prime minister, and we called them by their surnames. Whereas Thatcher became quite a kind of you know, if you said Thatcher, it meant you really hated her. So this isn't Aussie talking about this and you talking about the tube. My Brief anecdote on the side of a South African friend who was sent over as a young boy in the 19 sixties to Britain, never been outside South Africa, and his His dad had told him that in Britain, you have to go around shaking hands with everyone, introducing yourself. So he he got onto the district line, and he walked down every seat saying, hello. Just like to Introduce myself. Oh god. Yeah. Very good. Very good. Right. Here's one, for you as As you've been an MP, Theresa Featherston, is there anything to be gained writing to your local MP? My MP seems completely disengaged from her constituents. Her replies to letters are generic platitudes, and she hasn't held the surgery in 10 years. Teresa, do send us another question next week to tell us who that MP is, because I think MPs who don't deal with their constituents Should be outed and named and shamed. But Yeah. I often tell people to write to their MPs, and and I think sometimes it's worth it, and sometimes it's not. Well, so I think, put it in context, so firstly, I'm very surprised that her MP hasn't done a surgery in 10 years. I mean, nowadays it doesn't matter whether you're Labour, Conservative Lib Dem, People are generally very, very assiduous constituency MPs. They'll be criticized a little bit by opponents, but in my experience, People do their surgeries very, very regularly, and they aim to do, on average, 1 a week. And the postbac is insane. I mean, my predecessor's predecessor Was this was Willie Whitelaw, who was, missus Satcher's deputy prime minister because I talked to his secretary when she was doing in the 19 seventies. He got something like 4 letters a week, and he would reply to them by hand in the House of Commons Library. His greatest contribution to Political discourse was to say that his job was to go around the country stirring up apathy. So he obviously he obviously succeeded if he got 4 letters a week. No. I well, and then then, again, I remember talking to a Labour MP who claimed that his predecessor had said to him on his 1st day in, let me show you how you deal with the correspondence in the safe lay the seat, and he picked up 200 letters on his desk and put them all in the rubbish bin. Oh, I don't believe that. Those days, I'll tell you with the MP as in the next podcast. But the Truth is since then, I think things have changed an enormous amount. I think all MPs really feel that the way they hold on to their seats is by being very hardworking constituency campaigners, Getting out there, leafletting, but I was receiving 23,000 emails a year from people, a year. And if you think about that, And every single one of them, I would write a personal response to, but I needed a team to help draft this. So I'd read everyone. I'd edit it a little bit, but I needed a whole team to put together hundreds of these replies a week. And one of the problems with the whole system with the letters and going to see someone in surgery is, of course, the active MP, which most of us are really try to champion our constituents. And sometimes it actually works. So sometimes if you write off to complain to, I don't know, the DFID pensions office, You'll right an injustice. Sometimes you will be able to get somebody, you know, let off a parking fine or you'll be able to get some influence on a planning decision. But the truth is that it's a very odd system because it's very unfair to the people who aren't getting into their constituency MPs because in a sense, by getting into the constituency MPs, You're jumping the process, and and I don't know what the truth is there. On the one hand, you want to say the civil service should be able to deal with citizens regardless of whether or not an MP writes But on the other hand, as an MP, an elected MP, I want to feel that my letters are read by civil servants, I have an influence, and that I'm able to change a decision. Yep. Yep. And what about big letter writing campaigns? Like, you know, when you know it's a campaign, you're getting hundreds of postcards from the same with the same line. Do you think they have any effect? Well, they do have an impact because you see them in your postbox, and it does drive you to go to the whips and say, oy, oy, oy. I'm getting 500 emails this week about badges, whatever it is. But we've learned over time because these things just started Getting going when I began as an MP. Increasingly, MPs will just post if you write a standardized email, they'll just have a standard reply on their website Because they would have got 300 of the identical emails Mhmm. Sent to them. So I think the influence of those things are declining a little bit. Okay. Let's go for a quick break. Right. Gabrielle, I'm getting the sense that Roy and Alastair don't do 50% of the housework and or childcare. Oh, I would guesstimate this is not uncommon, but what is the justification for an for an unequal division of this work when both partners work. You're gonna start off on that? Oh, there isn't there isn't really one, And I can't I mean, 50% doesn't even get close for me. I think I am probably the least domesticated person that anybody's ever met in terms of, doing stuff around the house. Which is kinda weird. How did that happen, Alastair? Because you are basically a progressive lefty, But the only odd thing about you is that you spend less time doing domestic stuff than almost anyone I know. How did that happen? I think probably having A mother who, really looked after me on some things, so I I didn't learn to cook. Were you were you a very worshiped son? Were you the kind of favorite favorite boy? I wasn't no. I wasn't worshiped. In fact, when when my When I was born as the 3rd son, when my mom died, we found all these these letters. She wrote this letter to her sister, my auntie, Mattie, who died recently and having made a hundred. And she said she she started, I say, it was something like, he's very nice, but sadly, it's another boy. Oh, but that was you as a baby. But but as you grew up, presumably, you were the adored youngest son, the the the last boy in the house, etcetera. Certainly, I didn't I didn't have to I never cooked. I never learned to cook. I've cooked 1 meal in my entire life. I'm I'm not Boasting about it. I'm saying it would be some show. I've never changed a plug. I don't know how to change a tire. I am utterly impractical. I don't know. Honestly, when people say to me, how much money have you got? And I say, I don't know. They think I'm just sort of ridiculous, but it's because I don't actually know how to do online banking, and I and Fiona does everything. And I'm not proud of it. I'm not proud of it. But I'm I'm good at what I do. I'm good at what I do, and Fiona's really good at what she does. It's just that she does stuff that I do, work stuff, and she does a lot of other stuff as well. I think it's it's and and and, actually, to not not to completely, sort of let us off the hook. It's Actually true that in general still, men are not doing 50% of the work. And what about what about you? What about you, which I was pretty good with the children. I was pretty good when the children were growing up. Yeah. Well, so I'm I'm talking to you at the moment. Shashana's away in the States. I've got the kids alone here, so I've had them alone for 3, 4 days. And will you cook 3 meals today? Well, I'm I don't go much. They don't get very good food with me. They get kind of boiled eggs with me. It's kind of a bit rubbish. It's a slight Slightly rubbish situation. But, you know, they'll get home off the school bus at half past 4, and I will be with them from half past 4 until 7 when I'll read them and put them to bed, And then I'll start doing some work at 7. But, no, Shoshana does so much more of the heavy lifting than I do, and I think that It is deeply unfair. And I think if you are a working woman, and Shashana's managing a major international charity with 300 She's dealing with problems in Afghanistan, in Myanmar, and and she's worrying about all that stuff that you're talking about, and it's just impossible. I think it's very, very tough being a working mother with young kids. Callum Swanson, did Tony Blair ever seriously consider remaining in parliament after stepping down as PM, Perhaps even serving in Gordon Brown's cabinet? No. Okay. Absolutely not. He he he was absolutely clear about that. He was gonna go the day he resigned. Okay. Here's Catherine Adams. What do you think about the 4 day working week? All my white collar colleagues are agitating for it. I get the benefits, but what about public sector workers, NHS, teachers, council Services, etcetera. Seems unfair if it's just the corporate sector. We got a lot of questions about the 4 day week. Why is this something? Why is why is everyone excited about the 4 day week? There was a report a couple of weeks ago. Now if I get this right, we should put it in the in the newsletter. But, essentially, it said that it was this experiment that was done with some pretty major companies. And there was an interview with 1 of the guys who ran this big company, and he said that productivity had gone up. The workforce were much Pierre, the whole thing had been a total success, and they're not they're not going back. And and they pay them the same. Is that right? It's it's it's crucially no loss of pay. So you get Paid the same for 4 days that you used to be paid for 5 days. But it doesn't fit it doesn't fit with you, Alastair. You work like a 7 day week. I mean, the notion of you on a 4 day week is a bit difficult to get my head Yeah. And and, no, and I probably I think there are I think you were a bit like that, aren't you? Yeah. I think it is difficult at a senior level not To be working most of the time. Yeah. If you're in a responsible job, the idea that you can never really turn your phone off or take a weekend off is quite tough. And I definitely don't think you a 4 4 day week. I think the answer on the the the possible clash between private and public sector workers is that you change the culture. What I enjoyed about our chat with with Bernie Sanders was is, is kind of, you know, yeah. This stuff's really, really difficult, but you gotta do some big, bold, difficult stuff. And I I think this is a debate that's coming. Can I just get into that? Because this is question time. Paul Hilda, what did you make of at Bernie Sanders on his recent visit to the UK? Well, apart from the fact that he did far too many interviews, but apart from that, I thought he he he made he made a very positive impression. And, You know, our interview, obviously, will be the the best of all the interviews that he did. I think we can be very he he actually said that himself, didn't he? He did indeed. And he went straight Last I noticed to your old friend Jeremy Corbyn. They had a lovely photograph together, and and he said how much better the world would have been if Jeremy Corbyn and he had been ruling the world. Yeah. Well, I guess that well, they I think he's I mean, just read his book. I don't I think he's I see the similarities with Jeremy Corbyn, but there are also an awful lot of differences. But, dude, Sydney, we've not talked much about Jeremy Corbyn. Have you known him forever? Was he, like, a big figure in the early eighties? He wasn't really. No. He was He he was around, and people were aware of him, and he was a very good campaigner, and he could get noticed, and he made quite telling contributions. But, no, I don't think he was I would say he was He he would have been seen as a a big player on the political landscape back in the day. No? Just just on this, because I never fully understand this. We never get into this much, but There was a battle in the Labour Party, wasn't it? Throughout the eighties, which in a sense, you, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown were part of. And Jeremy Corbyn was on another wing of the party. That was like a Well, he was he presumably Jeremy Corbyn was no great fan of Tony Blair, to put it mildly. I don't think he personalized it in those ways, but I he was no fan of what we were trying to do to the Labour Party. But I think that battle, in a way, had had already been fought, and when Neil Kinnock took on militant and but, certainly, Jeremy Corbyn was He was well known within the Labour Party, but I think he had his his key issues that he campaigned on, that he fought on. He was very associated with the Irish republican cause, for example, he was very associated with Israel Palestine, as he is now. And always, I mean, Lyle live not far from his constituency. Always, I would say, seen as somebody that within his constituency, very Very hardworking, popular, etcetera. But, no, was he somebody that when we were planning big things and big changes. Were we thinking, woo, how is Jeremy Corbyn re gonna react to this? No. He wasn't. So I think I've said to you before that even the day that Ed Miliband resigned, when I was such in a radio studio with Jeremy Corbyn, talking about the fallout from the election that led to Ed's resignation. I honestly think if I'd have said on that day, Jeremy's gonna be the next leader of the Labour Party, I'd have been, you know, bundled off in a in a white van with the men in white coats. The the other person we don't talk about much, but who Bernie Sanders reminded me of a bit, was Michael Foot. I mean, they both had that sense of a kind of highly sort of quite a sort of professorial serious Cirrus Manor. Yeah. I think that's a better I think that's a better comparison because the other thing I would say about about Sanders compared to to Jeremy, And and this definitely comes through in his book. Jeremy is very much a campaigner and, I think, a a politician of protest, whereas Sanders is very much about trying to get stuff done. I'm not saying Jeremy Corbyn doesn't care about what gets done. Of course, he does. And I'd say the same about Michael Foote. Michael Foote was somebody who had huge experience in government. Michael was also an intellectual. He was a great writer. He was among the most prolific readers ever. He, again, lived very near to us, and We were very friendly with him right to the end. And and when he died, a few of us were given the opportunity to go around to his house and just Take whatever books we wanted of of Weichall's vast, vast library. And the thing you could tell you know, when you go into somebody's See their bookshelves, you can tell whether they're really a reader or not, and these were books that were you talk about Mark Francois with his red stickers on his page. You know? These were books that were properly read. So I think that is that is maybe a better comparison. Good. Okay. Well, I think we're coming towards the end, but do have you got a last one that you wanna finish on? Yeah. Talk about it's another one about book story. Jam Norman, you often talk about books you've enjoyed. Do you both always Plow through a book even you if you don't connect with it, or is there a point where you just put it down and say it's not for you? Oh, I I give up very, very quickly. So do I. So So what what about Shoshanna? Is this a man woman thing? Fiona I have sort of seen Fiona torture herself by reading books. To 5 pages, she said, this is really crap. And then days later, she's still reading it. And I'm saying, why are you reading a book? She said because if I start a book, I have to finish it. Yeah. No. I'm completely unlike that. I think I've got at the moment something like 1700 books on my Kindle, And I definitely by 11 by the bed. My I of the Kindle saved me. I used to travel with 20 box in my suitcase because I couldn't trust not to hop between them. But how does that fit how does that fit with your only ever take hand luggage, which is is a is a rule of life that must be obeyed by everybody? It's Incredibly important, and it's become much easier since I moved over onto Kindle. Right. Now we were just gonna finish with book and TV recommendations. So Sarah McCabe asked for some Jordan book Recommendations following last week's Israel book recommendations. On that, I would actually suggest weirdly that one of the things to look at if you're going to Jordan His books by and about the royal family. So Avi Shlaim's lion of Jordan, which is about king Hussein's worth reading, But, actually, the book by the current king, king Abdullah, Our Last Best Hope, which focuses on the Middle East peace process, And perhaps to put in a plug for another Jordanian prince, prince Ghazi, his thinkers guide to Islam. So there we are. There are 3 3 Jordanian recommendations for me. The King Hussein book, I I I do his funeral was one of the most incredible events I ever went to in my life, and he he did he really I I mean, as you know, I'm not much of a monarchist, but he really did seem to have something very, very special that held people together. Well, let's get a recommendation for you. What have you been watching? Or I am reading a book called Life in the Balance Mhmm. By Jim Down, who is an intensive care unit doctor, and it's, it's his stories of of of life in intensive care, including looking after Alexander Levonenko, including dealing with, victims of bombings, but more, That's the dramatic, high profile stuff. But actually, it's just really interesting about the emotional and Sometimes moral dilemmas that doctors have to have to live with, and and and also the fact that he he's somebody who who gets very anxious about stuff as well. And, You know, having having just sort of it's just a it's a very emotional account of what it's like to be an intensive care unit doctor. Oh, good. Oh, I I'll look for that. I've also been watching on Netflix. I don't know whether people enjoy watching foreign language stuff, but I've been watching Sacred Games, which is, Hindi series. For crime series. Have you finished Only Murders in the Building? You know, I really liked it, and then my mother and Shoshanna got completely fed up with And and refused refused to keep watching it. That's interesting because I got fed up with it. Fiona's sticking with it and she's now into the 2nd series, I got fed up with I I I found it very funny to start with. I quite enjoyed it, but I a bit like some of the books by my bed, I I gave up after about 4 episodes. Well, the other thing I've been, stuck on Twitter on is a huge conversation about the Marvel multiverse and people trying to tell me which the 24 to 26 movies Starring Iron Man, Thor, and the rest I should be watching, but my recommendation this week is Sacred Games. So it's on Netflix, and it stars a slightly overworked A Sikh policeman in in Mumbai, and it's sort of strange, kind of Half thriller, half mystery, but also quite a sort of gritty portrait of change in Indian domestic life from the 19 seventies through. And and I I also enjoy trying to get my Hindi Urdu a little bit better because it's got subtitles. Very good. Very good. Well, you're you're obviously not working hard enough. You've got time to watch all these television series. Exactly. 100%. I've just I I've just been working very, very hard, and I've not watched anything. Well, you're much more serious person than me. That's the the main thing to conclude this question time on. Right. Thank you very much. Right. I'm gonna have my I'm gonna have my turnip on toast for lunch now. Turnip on toast and read a bit of Hagel for lunch. And then Excellent. Thanks, Anthony. See you later. See you later. Bye bye.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. So, Alastair, to start us off, we've got a lovely question from Ellie Scott, who asks, Share your best memories of Betty Boothroyd. And for listeners who haven't heard, Betty Boothroyd has died this week. So Alastair.\n\nSpeaker 0: So Betty, Yorkshire born Juspry, she was a Tiller girl, famously, a dancer, and became an MP for West Bromwich, and she was the first ever Woman, speaker of the House of Commons, 1st female speaker of the House of Commons, labor to her core, but I think hugely respected as a as a speaker Speaker, and, of course, became one of the most famous speakers because it coincided with, with television cameras being allowed into parliament. She wasn't the 1st TV speaker, but she was the 1st that was there for quite a long time. And she was a lovely, lovely, lovely woman. If I had, I think you've had 1 2 memories, actually, that popped into my head when people said that on the day she died. The first was, I remember During the period when I was really under the cosh, in number 10 when the I felt like, you know, the the Tories were after me.\n\nThe media were after me the whole time. Quite a few people Or on our own side, we're sort of thinking, oh, isn't it about time we sort of chopped his head off? And I and I got a phone call from the speaker's secretary saying, The speaker wonders if you'd like to pop in for a cup of tea, which happened periodically. And so I thought, oh god. Not Betty as well.\n\nIt's gonna be sort of, you know, Gagging up on me. And I went there, and we sat down, and we had a cup of tea, and we dunked our digestive biscuits, and She could not have been nicer, and she just said, listen. You're getting a lot of grief. You're getting a lot of flack, but I just hope you understand that the reason you're getting it is because This lot is scared of you, and they they know that you're doing a good job for Tony, and that's your job, and that's what you what you gotta keep doing. And so little acts like that.\n\nAnd then the other really powerful memory, she got involved in the People's Vote campaign, and I just remember the first time and, obviously, a lot of the the the campaign was full of young volunteers, and most of them well, they weren't born when Betty was kind of, you know, on the TV the whole time. And she came along and she did this speech, and there were these young people behind her. You can get a film of this. There's young people on the stage behind her. And you could see the impact that she was having as she told her story of why Europe mattered so much to her, and she'd been to Germany after to the war, and she'd made some German friends.\n\nAnd the last time I spoke to her, I said this on the main podcast, the last time I spoke to her is when she phoned me up to that Radio 4 debate I did with Jacob Rees Mogg, and so I can honestly say I don't know what her actual last words were, But I can say that her last words to me were, I will not stop. I will never give up on the dream that we'll one day be back in the European Union because this is an absolute, a total unmitigated disaster. So I will take that with me as inspiration going forward.\n\nSpeaker 1: Lovely. Now time for you to ask me a question.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mel Griffiths, How long did it take you to stop laughing when you heard that Boris Johnson is hoping to be appointed NATO secretary general? And you same theme, my dog, Bert. Do you think Boris Johnson seriously thinks he has a chance to become head of NATO? Isn't it common knowledge that he's taken Russian money, visited banga banga parties where they obtained Kompromat, and put an ex KGB son in his House of Lords and also sat on the Russia report.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's it's staggering, isn't it? He would be the most unsuitable head of NATO imaginable. I mean, that's a job which has generally gone to quite For serious people who work collegially, who focus on the details of defence expenditure, it would be a great honour If Britain were to get that job, it's been a a long time since since, actually\n\nSpeaker 0: George Roberson.\n\nSpeaker 1: George Roberson. Yeah. Was and who did a very good job and was a very respected\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That is secretary general who'd been the labor minister. So Britain's been hoping to get that job back for a very long time. I know there was There's been talk about Mark Sedwell. He's the, ex cabinet secretary, was in the running for it. Some people think Ben Wallace Might be in the running for it, but I would have thought Boris Johnson would be short of making him the abbot of a Trappist monastery.\n\nIt would be difficult to find a worse job.\n\nSpeaker 0: I I also think that at the weekend, because the only thing about NATO is that that position is decided by The heads of government, essentially. And I think the most important head of government in relation to NATO is the president of America. And this little mini campaign Johnson was running coincided with the revelation in one of the Sunday newspapers that when he was discussing the protocol issues with some of his colleagues, and somebody said, well, the Americans, we've got to do this to please the Americans. He said, fuck the Americans. So I'm not sure that will help him either.\n\nMore serious one, Rory, Nigel McFeat, which is the better option? For Ukraine to employ the might of NATO military hardware To completely push Russia out of all Ukraine and so risk World War 3, or for Ukraine to cede Crimea and Donbas in return for Russian troop withdrawal from remaining areas, and so avert World War 3?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's it's a good question, and it's one that people have gotta keep asking because Obviously, the consensus now with the West US and its allies articulated by Fiona Hill, who I hope people have a chance to listen to on our Our leading podcast\n\nSpeaker 0: She was good, wasn't she?\n\nSpeaker 1: She she was very serious, very interesting, and worth worth definitely listening to. And for people who don't know, she's probably the leading Russia expert In and around the US government. Anyway, the conventional wisdom is no appeasement, no compromise, Arm Ukraine to the teeth and fight until Russia withdraws back to its pre 2014 borders, including giving back Crimea. But at the same time, We just can't get into that lazily. There's a lot to be said for it.\n\nIt's absolutely true that Putin, unless he's contained, is A horrifying authoritarian dictator who will want to get his teeth into the Baltic and expand Russia in every direction. It's also true that if we don't stand up to him in Ukraine, China and other countries we tempted to screw around elsewhere. So I think we're on the right policy, but we've got to keep asking ourselves whether there is a route to peace. And in the end, peace does involve compromise. We're just not ready to get there yet.\n\nSpeaker 0: And one the one one of the things that Fiona Hill said was Is she worried that this becomes like a kind of Iran Iraq, just sort of grinds on? But I don't believe that the Western democracies will keep Supporting it to the extent that they have been, which I think we both agree has been impressive, albeit with some sort of hesitancy and some sort of slowness in response at times. But, ultimately, you're talking about a country here that's being being destroyed. And Russia, we've said this so many times, Putin is not going to give up. He's the only person who actually could call this off, and he's unlikely to.\n\nAnd it feels like a sort of stalemate at the moment. It feels militarily like a stalemate. But how long can that go on, and how long can people keep saying, well, we have to just keep arming them more and more. That's where I would like to be, but I I I fear that, There was a big demonstration in in Germany at the weekend. The hard right in America, the sort of Trumpians are becoming very kinda critical of Biden on continuing to sort of Put so much into this.\n\nSo the politics are not gonna get easier.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's not gonna get easier. I think we both agree that the policy at the moment is correct. It was correct To get in behind Ukraine, it was right to challenge Russia, it's right to arm Ukraine, but it's also true that I've noticed over kind of 30 years in and out of Foreign policy stuff that the West often gets overly optimistic. I remember in 2014, everybody predicting that Putin would be crushed by sanctions in 6 months.\n\nI remember people predicting in 2011 that Bashar al Assad could only last 6 months. I remember You'll remember people predicting that, you know, Osama bin Laden would die of kidney failure. I mean, there's a lot of of what what's called optimism bias in this stuff, Now I think Fiona Hill is more likely to be right that this is gonna grind on for a long time, and it's gonna test our democracy's limit. Here's a question for you from Evan Shawcross. I was listening to the Question Time episode last week when you got into conspiracy theories as well as dealing with grief.\n\nAnd I was wondering, Alastair, if If either of you have lost someone who were close because they changed their beliefs, Evan Shawcross. I, for example, am attempting To deal with the way in which my father has fallen completely down the conspiracy rabbit hole. We can no longer talk about anything because of his obsession over vaccines, scenes among other things. Have you experienced anything like this at all? What would you advise people to do?\n\nTry and change their views, cut them out?\n\nSpeaker 0: God. That that's because normally am I wrong about this? Isn't it normally that it's older people who are worrying with about younger people having conspiracy Here is proof I got that wrong. This is a younger person saying that their elderly parent\n\nSpeaker 1: Has got into this stuff.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. I find that quite difficult. I must be honest. I think all you can do is do you try and persuade them?\n\nI don't know if you try and persuade them. I think you try and love them. And, if you think they're at the end towards the end of their life, I think you just try and, I don't know. It's that's a tough one. That's a tough one.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's a very tough one. And I guess because I think one of the things that seems to happen in my experience, particularly with men as they get older, is that their minds become Much more rigid. And and I think it is a question of\n\nSpeaker 0: Not us, Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: Not us. Thank goodness. No. No. Not us.\n\nThank But it's sort of getting people onto another track, working out how you have the techniques to sort of move on. But the problem is for Evan's dad, I guess, this question around his obsession over vaccines will be more important to him than almost anything else, and he'll be reluctant to sort of move on And talk about something else, and he'll sense that his son isn't taking him seriously. So it must be very difficult.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think in those circumstances, I would do my level best to try and park it, but that's quite difficult.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. UBI, universal basic income. Andrew Oliver Riley. Be interested to hear your thoughts on universal basic income.\n\nSpeaker 0: Broadly in favor until you actually try to look at the detail of how it would be done.\n\nSpeaker 1: So in my case, I'm very, very much in favor of cash. Obviously, that's what GiveDirectly, the charity I work with, does in Africa. I'm particularly interested actually in the impact of one time payments which can transform people's lives if done at the right level, one time cash payments. And in Africa, because the levels of poverty, a dollar there is like a kind of $200 in the United States and $550 can make a transformatory difference to someone's life. Obviously, to some extent, our welfare states are based on the assumption that we should be providing cash support to make sure that people can meet their basic needs.\n\nThe question is Whether we're adequately doing that and whether the best way to do that is to make it universal as opposed to targeted on the very poorest.\n\nSpeaker 0: Ed Miliband's, book, Go Big, Has a lot on this, which is is worth worth a read.\n\nSpeaker 1: Are you are you missing him? Do you think he should be the intellectual powerhouse to the new labor movement?\n\nSpeaker 0: But he's he's he's part of the Shelley cabinet, and he's doing the big green stuff. Yep. I think Ed has, has grown out of leadership as it were. Ticket. Into into a new position.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Here's here's a weird question for you. Sam Wiltshire, as a youngish Aussie that moved to the UK in 2010, I don't understand why Margaret Thatcher She's constantly referred to as Mrs. Thatcher, whereas all other prime ministers are more often referred to as John Major or just Cameron. How come she has that distinction compared to Britain's other former prime ministers?\n\nYou know, he says that's true, isn't it? I remember getting in real trouble from my constituency. When I first Address them. I would refer to her as Thatcher, and they would get very, very, very angry conservative association members. They thought it was deeply disrespectful.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think I think there's 2 things here. The first thing, I I tend to call her missus Thatcher, whereas I would not say mister Wilson or mister Major.\n\nSpeaker 1: Or even missus May. You don't say missus May, do you?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I'd say I'd say Theresa May, I think, or I'd say May. Yeah. I think there is a sort of, This is back to the thing. I had the one of those terrible you know, it's the old thing about am I the only person who when I sit on a tube, I'm sitting there on the tube and and a woman gets up, And and I was just conditioned as a child that you you stand up for a woman.\n\nOkay?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: So but now I'm sort of And I'm very reluctant because I think if I stand up, I'm basically saying to them, I think you're older and less fit than I am.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. But the same politeness Yeah. Is, I think, what partly drives us calling her missus Thatcher. Don't forget as well, I think Thatcher became people define her as Thatcher in a very negative, aggressive, hateful way.\n\nSpeaker 1: It rhymed, amongst other things, with milk snatcher. Share.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Whereas whereas with Cameron, I don't think when people say Cameron, they're saying Cameron, that awful person. They're just saying Cameron, who was the prime minister, and we called them by their surnames. Whereas Thatcher became quite a kind of you know, if you said Thatcher, it meant you really hated her.\n\nSpeaker 1: So this isn't Aussie talking about this and you talking about the tube. My Brief anecdote on the side of a South African friend who was sent over as a young boy in the 19 sixties to Britain, never been outside South Africa, and his His dad had told him that in Britain, you have to go around shaking hands with everyone, introducing yourself. So he he got onto the district line, and he walked down every seat saying, hello. Just like to Introduce myself.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh god. Yeah. Very good. Very good. Right.\n\nHere's one, for you as As you've been an MP, Theresa Featherston, is there anything to be gained writing to your local MP? My MP seems completely disengaged from her constituents. Her replies to letters are generic platitudes, and she hasn't held the surgery in 10 years. Teresa, do send us another question next week to tell us who that MP is, because I think MPs who don't deal with their constituents Should be outed and named and shamed. But Yeah.\n\nI often tell people to write to their MPs, and and I think sometimes it's worth it, and sometimes it's not.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so I think, put it in context, so firstly, I'm very surprised that her MP hasn't done a surgery in 10 years. I mean, nowadays it doesn't matter whether you're Labour, Conservative Lib Dem, People are generally very, very assiduous constituency MPs. They'll be criticized a little bit by opponents, but in my experience, People do their surgeries very, very regularly, and they aim to do, on average, 1 a week. And the postbac is insane. I mean, my predecessor's predecessor Was this was Willie Whitelaw, who was, missus Satcher's deputy prime minister because I talked to his secretary when she was doing in the 19 seventies.\n\nHe got something like 4 letters a week, and he would reply to them by hand in the House of Commons Library.\n\nSpeaker 0: His greatest contribution to Political discourse was to say that his job was to go around the country stirring up apathy. So he obviously he obviously succeeded if he got 4 letters a week.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I well, and then then, again, I remember talking to a Labour MP who claimed that his predecessor had said to him on his 1st day in, let me show you how you deal with the correspondence in the safe lay the seat, and he picked up 200 letters on his desk and put them all in the rubbish bin.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I don't believe that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Those days, I'll tell you with the MP as in the next podcast. But the Truth is since then, I think things have changed an enormous amount. I think all MPs really feel that the way they hold on to their seats is by being very hardworking constituency campaigners, Getting out there, leafletting, but I was receiving 23,000 emails a year from people, a year. And if you think about that, And every single one of them, I would write a personal response to, but I needed a team to help draft this. So I'd read everyone.\n\nI'd edit it a little bit, but I needed a whole team to put together hundreds of these replies a week. And one of the problems with the whole system with the letters and going to see someone in surgery is, of course, the active MP, which most of us are really try to champion our constituents. And sometimes it actually works. So sometimes if you write off to complain to, I don't know, the DFID pensions office, You'll right an injustice. Sometimes you will be able to get somebody, you know, let off a parking fine or you'll be able to get some influence on a planning decision.\n\nBut the truth is that it's a very odd system because it's very unfair to the people who aren't getting into their constituency MPs because in a sense, by getting into the constituency MPs, You're jumping the process, and and I don't know what the truth is there. On the one hand, you want to say the civil service should be able to deal with citizens regardless of whether or not an MP writes But on the other hand, as an MP, an elected MP, I want to feel that my letters are read by civil servants, I have an influence, and that I'm able to change a decision.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Yep. And what about big letter writing campaigns? Like, you know, when you know it's a campaign, you're getting hundreds of postcards from the same with the same line. Do you think they have any effect?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, they do have an impact because you see them in your postbox, and it does drive you to go to the whips and say, oy, oy, oy. I'm getting 500 emails this week about badges, whatever it\n\nSpeaker 0: is.\n\nSpeaker 1: But we've learned over time because these things just started Getting going when I began as an MP. Increasingly, MPs will just post if you write a standardized email, they'll just have a standard reply on their website Because they would have got 300 of the identical emails Mhmm. Sent to them. So I think the influence of those things are declining a little bit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Let's go for a quick break. Right. Gabrielle, I'm getting the sense that Roy and Alastair don't do 50% of the housework and or childcare. Oh, I would guesstimate this is not uncommon, but what is the justification for an for an unequal division of this work when both partners work.\n\nSpeaker 1: You're gonna start off on that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, there isn't there isn't really one, And I can't I mean, 50% doesn't even get close for me. I think I am probably the least domesticated person that anybody's ever met in terms of, doing stuff around the house.\n\nSpeaker 1: Which is kinda weird. How did that happen, Alastair? Because you are basically a progressive lefty, But the only odd thing about you is that you spend less time doing domestic stuff than almost anyone I know. How did that happen?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think probably having A mother who, really looked after me on some things, so I I didn't learn to cook.\n\nSpeaker 1: Were you were you a very worshiped son? Were you the kind of favorite favorite boy?\n\nSpeaker 0: I wasn't no. I wasn't worshiped. In fact, when when my When I was born as the 3rd son, when my mom died, we found all these these letters. She wrote this letter to her sister, my auntie, Mattie, who died recently and having made a hundred. And she said she she started, I say, it was something like, he's very nice, but sadly, it's another boy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, but that was you as a baby. But but as you grew up, presumably, you were the adored youngest son, the the the last boy in the house, etcetera.\n\nSpeaker 0: Certainly, I didn't I didn't have to I never cooked. I never learned to cook. I've cooked 1 meal in my entire life. I'm I'm not Boasting about it. I'm saying it would be some show.\n\nI've never changed a plug. I don't know how to change a tire. I am utterly impractical. I don't know. Honestly, when people say to me, how much money have you got?\n\nAnd I say, I don't know. They think I'm just sort of ridiculous, but it's because I don't actually know how to do online banking, and I and Fiona does everything. And I'm not proud of it. I'm not proud of it. But I'm I'm good at what I do.\n\nI'm good at what I do, and Fiona's really good at what she does. It's just that she does stuff that I do, work stuff, and she does a lot of other stuff as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's it's and and and, actually, to not not to completely, sort of let us off the hook. It's Actually true that in general still, men are not doing 50% of the work.\n\nSpeaker 0: And what about what about you? What about you, which I was pretty good with the children. I was pretty good when the children were growing up.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, so I'm I'm talking to you at the moment. Shashana's away in the States. I've got the kids alone here, so I've had them alone for 3, 4 days.\n\nSpeaker 0: And will you cook 3 meals today?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm I don't go much. They don't get very good food with me. They get kind of boiled eggs with me. It's kind of a bit rubbish. It's a slight Slightly rubbish situation.\n\nBut, you know, they'll get home off the school bus at half past 4, and I will be with them from half past 4 until 7 when I'll read them and put them to bed, And then I'll start doing some work at 7. But, no, Shoshana does so much more of the heavy lifting than I do, and I think that It is deeply unfair. And I think if you are a working woman, and Shashana's managing a major international charity with 300 She's dealing with problems in Afghanistan, in Myanmar, and and she's worrying about all that stuff that you're talking about, and it's just impossible. I think it's very, very tough being a working mother with young kids. Callum Swanson, did Tony Blair ever seriously consider remaining in parliament after stepping down as PM, Perhaps even serving in Gordon Brown's cabinet?\n\nSpeaker 0: No.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely not. He he he was absolutely clear about that. He was gonna go the day he resigned.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Here's Catherine Adams. What do you think about the 4 day working week? All my white collar colleagues are agitating for it. I get the benefits, but what about public sector workers, NHS, teachers, council Services, etcetera.\n\nSeems unfair if it's just the corporate sector. We got a lot of questions about the 4 day week. Why is this something? Why is why is everyone excited about the 4 day week?\n\nSpeaker 0: There was a report a couple of weeks ago. Now if I get this right, we should put it in the in the newsletter. But, essentially, it said that it was this experiment that was done with some pretty major companies. And there was an interview with 1 of the guys who ran this big company, and he said that productivity had gone up. The workforce were much Pierre, the whole thing had been a total success, and they're not they're not going back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and they pay them the same. Is that right? It's it's it's crucially no loss of pay. So you get Paid the same for 4 days that you used to be paid for 5 days. But it doesn't fit it doesn't fit with you, Alastair.\n\nYou work like a 7 day week. I mean, the notion of you on a 4 day week is a bit difficult to get my head\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And and, no, and I probably I think there are I think you were a bit like that, aren't you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think it is difficult at a senior level not To be working most of the time. Yeah. If you're in a responsible job, the idea that you can never really turn your phone off or take a weekend off is quite tough. And I definitely don't think you a 4 4 day week.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the answer on the the the possible clash between private and public sector workers is that you change the culture. What I enjoyed about our chat with with Bernie Sanders was is, is kind of, you know, yeah. This stuff's really, really difficult, but you gotta do some big, bold, difficult stuff. And I I think this is a debate that's coming. Can\n\nSpeaker 1: I just get into that? Because this is question time. Paul Hilda, what did you make of at Bernie Sanders on his recent visit to the UK?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, apart from the fact that he did far too many interviews, but apart from that, I thought he he he made he made a very positive impression. And, You know, our interview, obviously, will be the the best of all the interviews that he did. I think we can be very he he actually said that himself, didn't he?\n\nSpeaker 1: He did indeed. And he went straight Last I noticed to your old friend Jeremy Corbyn. They had a lovely photograph together, and and he said how much better the world would have been if Jeremy Corbyn and he had been ruling the world.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, I guess that well, they I think he's I mean, just read his book. I don't I think he's I see the similarities with Jeremy Corbyn, but there are also an awful lot of differences.\n\nSpeaker 1: But, dude, Sydney, we've not talked much about Jeremy Corbyn. Have you known him forever? Was he, like, a big figure in the early eighties?\n\nSpeaker 0: He wasn't really. No. He was He he was around, and people were aware of him, and he was a very good campaigner, and he could get noticed, and he made quite telling contributions. But, no, I don't think he was I would say he was He he would have been seen as a a big player on the political landscape back in the day. No?\n\nSpeaker 1: Just just on this, because I never fully understand this. We never get into this much, but There was a battle in the Labour Party, wasn't it? Throughout the eighties, which in a sense, you, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown were part of. And Jeremy Corbyn was on another wing of the party. That was like a Well, he was he presumably Jeremy Corbyn was no great fan of Tony Blair, to put it mildly.\n\nI\n\nSpeaker 0: don't think he personalized it in those ways, but I he was no fan of what we were trying to do to the Labour Party. But I think that battle, in a way, had had already been fought, and when Neil Kinnock took on militant and but, certainly, Jeremy Corbyn was He was well known within the Labour Party, but I think he had his his key issues that he campaigned on, that he fought on. He was very associated with the Irish republican cause, for example, he was very associated with Israel Palestine, as he is now. And always, I mean, Lyle live not far from his constituency. Always, I would say, seen as somebody that within his constituency, very Very hardworking, popular, etcetera.\n\nBut, no, was he somebody that when we were planning big things and big changes. Were we thinking, woo, how is Jeremy Corbyn re gonna react to this? No. He wasn't. So I think I've said to you before that even the day that Ed Miliband resigned, when I was such in a radio studio with Jeremy Corbyn, talking about the fallout from the election that led to Ed's resignation.\n\nI honestly think if I'd have said on that day, Jeremy's gonna be the next leader of the Labour Party, I'd have been, you know, bundled off in a in a white van with the men in white coats.\n\nSpeaker 1: The the other person we don't talk about much, but who Bernie Sanders reminded me of a bit, was Michael Foot. I mean, they both had that sense of a kind of highly sort of quite a sort of professorial serious Cirrus Manor.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think that's a better I think that's a better comparison because the other thing I would say about about Sanders compared to to Jeremy, And and this definitely comes through in his book. Jeremy is very much a campaigner and, I think, a a politician of protest, whereas Sanders is very much about trying to get stuff done. I'm not saying Jeremy Corbyn doesn't care about what gets done. Of course, he does.\n\nAnd I'd say the same about Michael Foote. Michael Foote was somebody who had huge experience in government. Michael was also an intellectual. He was a great writer. He was among the most prolific readers ever.\n\nHe, again, lived very near to us, and We were very friendly with him right to the end. And and when he died, a few of us were given the opportunity to go around to his house and just Take whatever books we wanted of of Weichall's vast, vast library. And the thing you could tell you know, when you go into somebody's See their bookshelves, you can tell whether they're really a reader or not, and these were books that were you talk about Mark Francois with his red stickers on his page. You know? These were books that were properly read.\n\nSo I think that is that is maybe a better comparison. Good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, I think we're coming towards the end, but do have you got a last one that you wanna finish on?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Talk about it's another one about book story. Jam Norman, you often talk about books you've enjoyed. Do you both always Plow through a book even you if you don't connect with it, or is there a point where you just put it down and say it's not for you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, I I give up very, very quickly.\n\nSpeaker 0: So do I. So So what what about Shoshanna? Is this a man woman thing? Fiona I have sort of seen Fiona torture herself by reading books. To 5 pages, she said, this is really crap.\n\nAnd then days later, she's still reading it. And I'm saying, why are you reading a book? She said because if I start a book, I have to finish it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. I'm completely unlike that. I think I've got at the moment something like 1700 books on my Kindle, And I definitely\n\nSpeaker 0: by 11 by the bed.\n\nSpeaker 1: My I of the Kindle saved me. I used to travel with 20 box in my suitcase because I couldn't trust not to hop between them.\n\nSpeaker 0: But how does that fit how does that fit with your only ever take hand luggage, which is is a is a rule of life that must be obeyed by everybody?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's Incredibly important, and it's become much easier since I moved over onto Kindle. Right. Now we were just gonna finish with book and TV recommendations. So Sarah McCabe asked for some Jordan book Recommendations following last week's Israel book recommendations. On that, I would actually suggest weirdly that one of the things to look at if you're going to Jordan His books by and about the royal family.\n\nSo Avi Shlaim's lion of Jordan, which is about king Hussein's worth reading, But, actually, the book by the current king, king Abdullah, Our Last Best Hope, which focuses on the Middle East peace process, And perhaps to put in a plug for another Jordanian prince, prince Ghazi, his thinkers guide to Islam. So there we are. There are 3 3 Jordanian recommendations for me.\n\nSpeaker 0: The King Hussein book, I I I do his funeral was one of the most incredible events I ever went to in my life, and he he did he really I I mean, as you know, I'm not much of a monarchist, but he really did seem to have something very, very special that held people together.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let's get a recommendation for you. What have you been watching? Or\n\nSpeaker 0: I am reading a book called Life in the Balance Mhmm. By Jim Down, who is an intensive care unit doctor, and it's, it's his stories of of of life in intensive care, including looking after Alexander Levonenko, including dealing with, victims of bombings, but more, That's the dramatic, high profile stuff. But actually, it's just really interesting about the emotional and Sometimes moral dilemmas that doctors have to have to live with, and and and also the fact that he he's somebody who who gets very anxious about stuff as well. And, You know, having having just sort of it's just a it's a very emotional account of what it's like to be an intensive care unit doctor.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, good. Oh, I I'll look for that. I've also been watching on Netflix. I don't know whether people enjoy watching foreign language stuff, but I've been watching Sacred Games, which is, Hindi series. For crime series.\n\nSpeaker 0: Have you finished Only Murders in the Building?\n\nSpeaker 1: You know, I really liked it, and then my mother and Shoshanna got completely fed up with And and refused refused to keep watching it.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's interesting because I got fed up with it. Fiona's sticking with it and she's now into the 2nd series, I got fed up with I I I found it very funny to start with. I quite enjoyed it, but I a bit like some of the books by my bed, I I gave up after about 4 episodes.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, the other thing I've been, stuck on Twitter on is a huge conversation about the Marvel multiverse and people trying to tell me which the 24 to 26 movies Starring Iron Man, Thor, and the rest I should be watching, but my recommendation this week is Sacred Games. So it's on Netflix, and it stars a slightly overworked A Sikh policeman in in Mumbai, and it's sort of strange, kind of Half thriller, half mystery, but also quite a sort of gritty portrait of change in Indian domestic life from the 19 seventies through.
