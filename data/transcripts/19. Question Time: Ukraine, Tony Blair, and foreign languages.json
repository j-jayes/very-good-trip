So welcome to the rest is politics question time with me, Alastair Campbell. And me, Rory Stewart. So, Rory, we're we're getting close to into the 4 figures of questions every week. Where do you wanna start? Okay. So there was a good question, I thought, which I haven't got right in front of me, but it was a question about Macron and Ukraine, which I think caught your attention. And I think the question was, as far as I understand, are we being too soft On Macron, obviously, you're a you're a fan of Macron, but there's an argument that actually he has misplayed it and that his policy towards Putin has been naive. I saw that. It was from a guy called Ned Lam, and it it did catch my eye. Am I too soft on Macron? Possibly. Macron didn't have a great week with the elections. Not yet sure whether he's gonna get a parliamentary majority. He won the elections in one level. He's gonna get the most seats, but whether he gets majority. And I do think on The whole Jupiter thing, I think when the war started, Macron possibly thought that he could bring his charm And his intellectual firepower to bear with Putin. He could maybe push him more than he has. If you remember, he got quite a lot of grief Constantly having these very long phone calls and so forth. And then he said these things which really annoyed the Ukrainians. He said that, you know, Putin must be humiliated, must be Finding a good way out. He then said it should be at least 20 years before the Ukrainians are allowed into the EU. We shouldn't bend the rules, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. They did say this week that, you know, they want the Ukrainians to win the war, and he's going there. I don't think it's any secret. He's going there this week with Scholz and Mario Draghi. But, yeah, I think I think there's that Putin is definitely trying to play a divide and rule game within the European leadership, and Maybe to some extent, he's he's he's been successful. Also, it's very interesting during these legislative elections, both Melenchon, the left the populist leftist, And Le Pen, the populist writers, they both have kind of hardened up in their support for Putin. It's really been a bit weird to watch. So whether he's reflecting something of that, I just don't know. It's also I wonder whether it's actually not a mistake for him to say publicly that Putin needs to emerge with his kind of face or or honor intact, which you don't wanna humiliate him. But that's probably something that you might want to talk about Internally, it's a important thing to think about when you're negotiating with someone, but it's probably not something you wanna say publicly, that he's Almost revealing too much of his thinking and strategy more than he needs to. There was a great question on Ukraine from Alexander Kaye. We hear a lot about Putin's endgame, but what's the endgame for the west? Are there really any political solution political or only military solutions? And how do we avoid Russia becoming a nuclear ISIS? That was pretty scary. Pretty scary. And we're in a pretty scary situation as as you know in Ukraine at the moment. So The Russians are now closing in on a Severodonetsk, and they're also closing in on a place called Lysychansk. And in both cases, Lysychansk is a place about a 100,000 people. In both cases, that would make the end, really, for the Ukrainian presence in the Donbas, and the Ukrainian troops are increasingly surrounded. They're running out of ammunition and supplies, and you're really beginning to feel the force of the Russians. I think this is something we've discussed previously, that Russia, for the 1st 100 days, was such a disaster. There's a temptation to completely underestimate them now, but, of course, they do learn lessons. They've They've had a lot of generals killed. They've had a lot of people killed. They're a very, very big country, and they've got a huge amount of resources behind them. And I'm afraid that that that's part of the problem here. What what is the answer to this? Well, it's gonna be very, very difficult to dislodge Russia from those areas once they've taken them. I thought, Putin's latest public pronouncements, he's looked unbelievably smug. He's got that sort of smugness back. He did an event with some young people the other day, and it was it was the anniversary of Peter the Great's death. And I I think we've discussed before that he sees himself in the line of Peter the Great, Stalin, Ivan the Terrible, these are the only leaders that he sort of respects, and he was boasting about the His his historic role was to take back the lands we lost, and he just looked incredibly smug. He's got that sort of leaning back in the chair, It's sort of mixing smugness and menacing. It's, it's a deeply unpleasant mix. And it was a very weird speech, wasn't it? Because he actually even talked about invading Sweden or at least Peter the Great is invading Sweden. Mhmm. Mhmm. Well, he's very I think he's very troubled by this, the movement in Finland and Sweden on, on NATO membership and on some of the noises that have come out of there, although his his friend Erdogan is is trying to help push them back. And then there's the problem of of the United States trying to get and and Europe trying to get on-site, still failing to get on-site, Gulf states, India, Israel in really lining up to isolate Putin. And that's, You know, that's worrying, particularly Israel on the gulf. I mean, the the fact that United States influenced the Middle East seems to wane so much that they can't really get those countries who they've provided so much support for for so many years to ally with them on this issue. There's another question actually. I can't remember who it was from. It was, Was the whole thing about stopping Ukraine join the European Union, which, you know, I wonder whether that is what has pushed Macron to say It'll be 20 years before they get in kind of thing. Well, it definitely was, wasn't it? I mean, I think the answer to that question is that what worried Putin much more than NATO. He was actually bluffing when he said that he was worried about the NATO thing. He didn't think NATO was a threat to Russia. The threat is that if Ukraine joined the European Union, there be an example right on the Russian border of a prosperous, more democratic, more European state, and that's really what triggered him in 2014. Yeah. Yeah. Do you wanna pick another question? Yeah. Here we are. So, Johnny Deardon, how can the government balance the benefits of rewilding and with those keeping land and communities alive with work and affordable housing. Definitely one for you. Well, let let me let me try that one. So people will have followed that, actually, the government's Turn back on the commitment that Boris Johnson made to the conservative environmental movement and, indeed, to his wife Carrie, which is that he was gonna go for A lot of subsidies for more rewilding in Britain, and that has been shelved. And I think one of the reasons for that is something we've talked about in Which is that people are beginning to really worry about food security. It's amazing in Britain. We went for, I think, 12,000,000 Acres under production down to 9,000,000 acres under production taking land out for environmental schemes, and the government's drive was to do ever more of that. And I think this question around food security, the fact that we're not beginning to produce enough food to eat, you know, we hover around 50 Percent of the food we eat is actually produced in the United Kingdom is is making them rethink. We had a a little dispute, yesterday over, Ireland Northern Ireland. And there's a question here. Just tie tiny dispute. Yeah. It was tiny. We had a little a little well, I I mean, were we were we a couple, Roy? We would call it the spats. Nothing that listeners like more than 2 middle aged men shouting at each other that someone I wasn't shouting. Are you shouting at me? I wasn't sure. It was great. Instead of me arguing with you, why don't you why don't you inform me about something? Rory, I thought I thought that was just a very agreeable, robust Exchange of of views rooted in our in our in our factual assessments and our passions. Very good. Well, let's Okay? Don't be Set, Rory. Don't be upset, please. I gotcha. I don't wanna think that I'm upsetting. That would really, really ruin my day. Okay. I'm not upset. Honestly. Now. Got it. Got it. Now tell us When you're in when you're in government, did you have anything to do with something called the treasury devil? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Tell us about it. Well, Well, the treasury so the treasury devil has got to be the weirdest job title on the planet, and it's the name for a senior outside lawyer who is brought in to advise the government on really, really, really tricky stuff. And at the moment, it's a guy called Sir James Adie. Adie, e a d I e. Who I know a little bit. I remember him I know him. Actually. Yeah. Yeah. He he'd come in as a device. I started meetings where he advised us on stuff back in the day. Right. So he's the guy who, if the protocol row not our protocol row, but the protocol row, If it ended up in court, he's the guy who would represent the government. Okay? Now if you wind back, you may remember when this all first became an issue The government, they said they may have to break international law quotes in a limited and specific specific and limited way. And that led to some pretty senior resignations, advocate general, the treasury solicitor. And the lesson the government took was that if you're going to break the law as they're now doing, don't be so stupid as to say that you're doing it. Okay? So the basic plan is unchanged. They're breaking the law, but they went to answer, we must find a lawyer who's telling us that we're not actually breaking the law. And they found the lawyer. Do you know who it is? No. Suella Braverman, the attorney general. Okay? The one who thinks that Boris Johnson's wonderful. And she invented something called primordial significance, which Rest on the idea rest on the idea that the Good Friday agreement's more than important. The protocol and and the UK single market is more important than European Single market. And this apparently has the nickname BBS in government legal circles, which stands for Braverman bullshit. Okay? It only stands a chance If it's understood, there is no official advice to the contrary. So they decided not to ask sir James Eady. But then they were told, I'm afraid you're going to have to ask, sir James Eady, because he's been involved in this the whole way through. So they asked him, But they asked him to, quote, assume that the policy is lawful. Okay? That was the instruction he got. So he's like, okay. I assume the policy is lawful. But he wrote his response in such a way that anybody who reads it is absolutely clear that he thinks their approach, lacks credibility, isn't lawful and is not legally solid solid. So having had got the advice they wanted from the utterly political Sohail O'Braveman, They now know there is a paper lying around which would almost certainly get raised in court, and there you would have acting for the government, The man who is absolutely clear that what the government is doing is not lawful, which is a total, total mess. Yeah. It's amazing. When Yeah. When James Cleverley, The ill named James Cleverley was summoned to the council of commerce to explain this. He hid behind the whole, we never talk about legal advice to the government. But, of course, that would be true in a normal functional government where legal advice doesn't leak, but this lot leak like sieves. So it's now out there all around the government and legal circles within government that James Eadie basically thinks this thing is absolute nonsense. It's amazing. And it's all I I I saw the leak, and it's all couched in this weird civil service language. But he says he finds it more convincing reading the Singh, reading the argument that it's breaking international law. We know what that if you're a journalist Getting hold of that. I think you know what it means, don't you? Beautiful. Which this is Euna Mugabe. Which former politician has gone on to do most good in the world? Now I would argue that both Tony and Gordon have actually done lots of good stuff, on not least through the work they do through policy development stuff, but I think I'm gonna pick out Jimmy Carter on that. I think Jimmy Carter has been an extraordinary post presidential president, and he still sort of keeps going. Amazing. Amazing. And I I think to some extent, Mandela was probably the most dramatic example, wasn't he? I mean, he's somebody that you admire a lot, and we've talked about it a lot. He yeah. He's dead, though. He is certainly dead. We're talking about living politicians. Sorry. Al Gore Al Gore, I think, has done some amazing stuff on the environment, out of power. Yep. And And it's interesting how they do it in different ways. I Gordon Brown, I think, has done it very, very quietly, very responsibly, very, very seriously. And there's been much less the kind of razzmatazz that surrounds, you know, Al Gore or or some of the biggest celebrity politicians. You don't you you I'm I'm detecting you're not really liking Tony in you these days, Rory. I'm sort of just detecting something here. I'm fascinated by Tony Blair. I'm really fascinated by him, and I'm fascinated by the extent to which he remains so deeply, deeply involved in British politics And the way in which he has, still retains an uncanny ability to seize headlines, seize debates, the way in which he'll suddenly Take positions that are very, very timely or make a speech. That's because he's strategic. They're both strategic. And and it I think it is It is it is fascinating, but I do sometimes I've never I tell you what I've never really forgiven him for. I tell you let's get to the depth of my resentment. I've never really forgiven him for the fact that when Theresa May announced the withdrawal agreement, he was straight out there on that morning, and he said, I'm forming an unholy alliance with Boris Johnson to kill this. We both agree that this is the worst of all worlds. Now he thought that by destroying it, what he'd do is he'd have a second referendum, and we could remain in the European Union. But what he actually did is destroy destroy any chances of beating the ARG and Boris. And I thought Right. It was really really ill considered, and I thought it was catastrophic. Would you do you add me to the to the unforgiven list? Because I'd No. I I forgive you because I because I like and love you, and I know you. Now talking of, Former leaders, Chris Murgatroyd, who was your most feared opponent in terms of quick wit? And I'm gonna go there for for William Hague. Of all the leaders that Tony faced, William Hague was the one Who in parliament, in PMQs, got closest to even beginning to unsettle Tony, and there he did it through his extraordinary wit. And the thing is, though, I think I may have I may have told you this before. We we disarmed him by developing a line about William Hague, that he was all jokes and no judgment. And as a result of that, he stopped doing the jokes, and he stopped being witty, and therefore, he was weakened. But he was, for me, the most quick witted, opponent. What about you? Yep. Good. Very good. Very good. I think being funny is really important. I I I mean, look. He's not not, he's not a kind of necessarily big name, but I thought, for For example, Chris Bryant was very good at being funny at the right moments. Yeah. I Yeah. I think humor in parliament is hugely important. I mean, it was one of the things sadly went wrong for Keir Samer in his PMQs. You remember he said as part of his intervention, oh, dear. And the Tory backbenchers suddenly caught in that and started saying, oh, dear, oh, dear all the way through It's incredible how people got unsettled. Hey. Here's a question for John Brown. Same subject. Is there any value in PMQs? Questions are rarely answered, and it seems like it's more about theatrical performance. I mean, I think if we start saying there's no value in promises questions, we might as well give up on democracy. I think it has become very showbiz. What I used to like about PMQs when I was Working with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, I used to see it as a strategic anvil. This is where strategies get hammered out. It's where you really find out whether you've got a strong argument in a line of attack or not. And I'll tell you the other thing it does. I don't think with this government, because I don't think this is a functional government, and I think Johnson functions as a functional prime minister. But Tony used prime minister's questions as a way of driving the government machine. We would demand things from I think quite a lot of government departments were terrified of us on Tuesdays and Wednesday mornings because we were demanding Facts and detail and data and information and explanations, and we'd be going back saying this isn't good enough. And so I think that using prime minister's questions, not just for the kind of half hour event that it is, but actually as a strategic anvil A driver of government. That's where I think it was very important. I couldn't agree more. And, actually, it was the lesson that it took me a long time to learn as a minister. I'd probably been in 7, 8 years before I realized that the most powerful thing that you have is using parliament, using your public statements to take that mandate And use that with government and civil service rather than trying to argue every point privately, point by point inside your office using those public moments to drive it through. No. I was gonna say that the the the the other thing I was I would say about that is that prime minister's questions is this is the the other reason, I think, Johnson's sort of, lack of contact with the truth is a real problem because one of the other things that a prime minister and a minister can say is, I cannot say that if it's not true, So go and get me the facts. And Tony was absolutely he was that he would shout every Wednesday morning, I just want the facts. And You get the facts, and then you can start to make the political argument. Okay. Let's go for our break. Coming straight back in from the break here, I think a lovely point that you made there about pushing for the facts. I think one of the things that I notice sometimes with civil servants is that people I'd ask them a question. They'd say, well, I don't think you really want to say that, minister. So they wouldn't give me the information, and I'd have to push back and say, look. Give me the facts, and then I'll decide what to say. You can trust me not Savings, but I need to understand what the truth is behind this. I'm not going out there with you having concealed from me the bad news for fear that I might admit it when I'm on the public stage. There's a great question here from Steve Miles. Yeah. You know, we talked recently about how we were slightly downplayed Wales. Yeah. Steve Miles question. Netflix did an advert for a documentary about the mine a film about the miner's strike, which they said took place in Wales, comma, England. What what impressions do you guys get of how Wales and the rest of the UK are seen around the world? Of course, it's not just you know, I talk to people in Great Britain, British people who think that Northern Ireland is part of Great Britain, not the United Kingdom. I'll tell you the other thing. Even the French, The French are the worst at this. They still talk about long le terre, la reinde dans le terre, le gouvernemente dans le terre as though Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland don't exist. It really really gets my gut. We're we're we're a complete muddle, aren't we, as a country? And and I I noticed that Sometimes some of my colleagues use the word England when they mean Great Britain or when they mean United Kingdom. It's it's we we are in a complete model. Right. Here's a question for you. Lisa, I'm curious as a languages teacher in a land of English speakers, what languages do you both speak, and how and why did you learn them? Alastair, you're the language man. I speak fluent French. I used to speak fluent German, and I'm trying to get it back. I speak a tiny bit of Dutch, And I speak a tiny bit of Gaelic. I learned Gaelic as a child because my dad taught me even though we were growing up in Yorkshire. I speak French and German because I loved it at school, and I went on to do it at university. And I I love speaking French and German. I wish I spoke Chinese, and I wish I spoke Arabic, but I don't. And are you gonna are you gonna are you gonna try to pick up another language? You're gonna deepen your Gaelic or try to pick up a new one? Well, funnily enough, I offered I I suggested this idea as a documentary. I'm doing a big TV project at the moment, which I'm not allowed to talk about, but I'm I I did suggest this idea a while ago of trying to do a thing where I would go up. I thought b b Scotland might have jumped at it, where I would learn try and sort of speed learn Gaelic and see whether I could get up to a reasonable level because it's such a different language to English. It really is very, very different. But I'd love to learn Arabic, but I I don't know whether I'm a bit too old now. What about what language do you speak? Well, I I speak a lot of languages very, very, very badly, And they're getting worse all the time. It's not like you. I didn't study them properly. I I have studied at different times. I think 11 different languages. Yeah. And and in some of them, I can kinda get by. And some of them, I'm like somebody said it's like talking to an Uber driver who's been living in Britain for about 6 months. What do you speak? Which one do you speak best? I probably I think my best language is probably Indonesian When I was really concentrating on it. Right. And then Right. Probably French. Oh, Dari, I was fine chatting. I mean, I think my real strength People like Shoshana, my wife, get really annoyed with me because she is much much better at the grammar, but she says I'm much better at understanding people. I can understand almost everything that anybody is saying to me. Jenny, the other day, I was watch on the on the day of the the French parliamentary elections, I was I I was watching France France 24, the English language version, and they had 2 French presenters and 4 French politicians We were all speaking utterly flawless English. And I thought, I can't imagine if we were doing, if there was a a a a French version of the BBC that we would be able to get for politicians who could speak fluent French like that. Am I right that Tony Blair spoke very good French, did he? Sorry? Pretty good. He did a speech to one of the scare the times I tow saw Tony Blair absolutely terrified was when he did a speech in French at the National Assembly. I think Tony would accept his French is not quite as good as mine, but it's better than most. Okay. Here's a question from Sharon Metz. How can a green agenda sit next to the rising cost of living. Go on. God. Blimey. Thanks. I think it's it's it's a really it's a really good challenge. Listen. The the the the the answer is that Many of these agendas were not happening at a time when there were these kinds of economic pressures. So we have one example which we talked about in yesterday's show, Which is the, the the challenge of trying to weigh up land use. You know, how do you balance rewilding against, productive agriculture? I think there are real questions, faced in Germany for the moment, whether you use coal to generate power more cheaply when people are facing rising fuel prices. Anna, I think, sadly, it is going to put a lot of pressure on many of the expenditures we need to make on climate because there's always attention between the short term and the long term, and that becomes much more intense when people are facing inflation at 10%. The government has clearly diluted to the point of not irrelevance, but substantially diluted the Dimbleby food review. He sounded very dispirited when he was talking about it on the on the radio the other day. Yeah. I think that's right. I think that's right. Okay. Jeff Spink, how will Putin's hunger strategy unfold? Are we gonna have to ensure safe passage through the Black Sea with a naval presence and mine clearing capability? Goodness gracious to me. Well, listen. This is why I think the we we we should be really focused on a longer term thinking about about the whole immigration issue. I mean, I I've come to the conclusion this is all deliberate, And part of the consequence that he wants is to create famine and to create, even greater refugee streams coming our way, coming to the to the Western Europe. And I really don't think we talked we talked about food security in the context of the UK. What is the global food security strategy? What are the UN doing? What are the what's the World Food Organization doing there? And I'm not saying that as a critical way. I'm just asking that as a question. No. It's it's it's heartbreaking. You you you you've probably been following that Somalia is now in its 4th year of drought and famine. And and I I remember, I suppose it was 4 years ago, being in hospitals In Somalia and seeing women bringing in babies who were dying and women who'd lost a child crossing the desert on their way in. And If you're looking for an argument for international development and the reason why I backed the 0.7% and didn't want deferred merged, You really feel it there, and you're gonna feel it in Kenya. And very sadly, it's quite possible there's gonna be rain no rain this The end of this year either in Somalia. And it's barely funded, as you say. But it's it's quite it's quite horrible to think that I I mean, even though we've had some really bad people in history and there's some bad people in the world today, but you've got a guy sitting there now who's thought, right, well, I've you know, I was on the back foot for quite time, but I've got away with it. I'm still here. The sanctions aren't really destroying the economy in the way that they thought they might. The world is starting to Get a bit bored with Ukraine. I'm fracturing the European alliance. The Americans are still sort of pumping all the weapons, but, you know, I can sit that out. And meanwhile, if I start, you know, messing around with the grain the flow of grain around the world from Russia and Ukraine, I can both On the from the Russian side, I can keep the economy going maybe, but because, you know, they're they're also selling a lot of stolen grain. They're they're selling stolen Ukrainian grain as well. But equally, I can, you know, starve a few people and they're all you know, they want they're gonna have to start crossing borders and there'll be all chaos. I mean, it is pretty horrible to think that's what he's actually That's part of his plan now. It's awful. And and I think, you know, maybe it's a a way to conclude, but, I mean, I think it's a reminder of how Very fragile, vulnerable the world's system is in ways that we maybe didn't acknowledge 10, 20 years ago, how interdependent we are, And how everything from feeding starving people in Somalia through to keeping our semiconductor chips going depended on a peaceful relatively peaceful open global trading system. No. I think we should fit I should I think we shouldn't finish with that. It's a bit down. But, like, can we finish with this one from Paul Paul Heaney? When you 2 are working overseas, what is your actual job? What kind of organization is employing you? Well, I can say I'm Absolutely self employed. I travel around the world advising, speaking. I do a lot of my mental health stuff overseas. I'm actually They're off to Dublin tomorrow for a a mixture of speaking and politics. So I'm self employed, unemployed, call it what you want. What about you, Roy? So I'm actually been, mostly working abroad unpaid. I've been very, very lucky, which is that I was receiving a salary from Yale University to teach, And I make some money from this wonderful podcast, and that's allowed me to be able to volunteer for the last couple years, working with the charity recently in Jordan Syrian refugees and working with charities in Africa. At some point, if I if I start, yep, if I start doing more of it, I may start being paid. Good. Well, that would be very well deserved as you continue to spread eau de cologne, English eau de cologne around the world. Thank you, Alastair, and much love. And sorry about our argument yesterday. Never apologize, Rory. It was just it was part do I have look. Do I have to keep teaching you to toughen up. You didn't need to apologize. You you stood your ground. You expressed your opinion forcibly. You were wrong, but that's your prerogative. Thank you very much, and goodbye. See you next week. See you next week. Bye bye.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSo welcome to the rest is politics question time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: So, Rory, we're we're getting close to into the 4 figures of questions every week. Where do you wanna start?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So there was a good question, I thought, which I haven't got right in front of me, but it was a question about Macron and Ukraine, which I think caught your attention. And I think the question was, as far as I understand, are we being too soft On Macron, obviously, you're a you're a fan of Macron, but there's an argument that actually he has misplayed it and that his policy towards Putin has been naive.\n\nSpeaker 0: I saw that. It was from a guy called Ned Lam, and it it did catch my eye. Am I too soft on Macron? Possibly. Macron didn't have a great week with the elections.\n\nNot yet sure whether he's gonna get a parliamentary majority. He won the elections in one level. He's gonna get the most seats, but whether he gets majority. And I do think on The whole Jupiter thing, I think when the war started, Macron possibly thought that he could bring his charm And his intellectual firepower to bear with Putin. He could maybe push him more than he has.\n\nIf you remember, he got quite a lot of grief Constantly having these very long phone calls and so forth. And then he said these things which really annoyed the Ukrainians. He said that, you know, Putin must be humiliated, must be Finding a good way out. He then said it should be at least 20 years before the Ukrainians are allowed into the EU. We shouldn't bend the rules, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nThey did say this week that, you know, they want the Ukrainians to win the war, and he's going there. I don't think it's any secret. He's going there this week with Scholz and Mario Draghi. But, yeah, I think I think there's that Putin is definitely trying to play a divide and rule game within the European leadership, and Maybe to some extent, he's he's he's been successful. Also, it's very interesting during these legislative elections, both Melenchon, the left the populist leftist, And Le Pen, the populist writers, they both have kind of hardened up in their support for Putin.\n\nIt's really been a bit weird to watch. So whether he's reflecting something of that, I just don't\n\nSpeaker 1: know. It's also I wonder whether it's actually not a mistake for him to say publicly that Putin needs to emerge with his kind of face or or honor intact, which you don't wanna humiliate him. But that's probably something that you might want to talk about Internally, it's a important thing to think about when you're negotiating with someone, but it's probably not something you wanna say publicly, that he's Almost revealing too much of his thinking and strategy more than he needs to.\n\nSpeaker 0: There was a great question on Ukraine from Alexander Kaye. We hear a lot about Putin's endgame, but what's the endgame for the west? Are there really any political solution political or only military solutions? And how do we avoid Russia becoming a nuclear ISIS? That was pretty scary.\n\nSpeaker 1: Pretty scary. And we're in a pretty scary situation as as you know in Ukraine at the moment. So The Russians are now closing in on a Severodonetsk, and they're also closing in on a place called Lysychansk. And in both cases, Lysychansk is a place about a 100,000 people. In both cases, that would make the end, really, for the Ukrainian presence in the Donbas, and the Ukrainian troops are increasingly surrounded.\n\nThey're running out of ammunition and supplies, and you're really beginning to feel the force of the Russians. I think this is something we've discussed previously, that Russia, for the 1st 100 days, was such a disaster. There's a temptation to completely underestimate them now, but, of course, they do learn lessons. They've They've had a lot of generals killed. They've had a lot of people killed.\n\nThey're a very, very big country, and they've got a huge amount of resources behind them. And I'm afraid that that that's part of the problem here. What what is the answer to this? Well, it's gonna be very, very difficult to dislodge Russia from those areas once they've taken them.\n\nSpeaker 0: I thought, Putin's latest public pronouncements, he's looked unbelievably smug. He's got that sort of smugness back. He did an event with some young people the other day, and it was it was the anniversary of Peter the Great's death. And I I think we've discussed before that he sees himself in the line of Peter the Great, Stalin, Ivan the Terrible, these are the only leaders that he sort of respects, and he was boasting about the His his historic role was to take back the lands we lost, and he just looked incredibly smug. He's got that sort of leaning back in the chair, It's sort of mixing smugness and menacing.\n\nIt's, it's a deeply unpleasant mix.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it was a very weird speech, wasn't it? Because he actually even talked about invading Sweden or at least Peter the Great is invading Sweden. Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm. Well, he's very I think he's very troubled by this, the movement in Finland and Sweden on, on NATO membership and on some of the noises that have come out of there, although his his friend Erdogan is is trying to help push them back.\n\nSpeaker 1: And then there's the problem of of the United States trying to get and and Europe trying to get on-site, still failing to get on-site, Gulf states, India, Israel in really lining up to isolate Putin. And that's, You know, that's worrying, particularly Israel on the gulf. I mean, the the fact that United States influenced the Middle East seems to wane so much that they can't really get those countries who they've provided so much support for for so many years to ally with them on this issue.\n\nSpeaker 0: There's another question actually. I can't remember who it was from. It was, Was the whole thing about stopping Ukraine join the European Union, which, you know, I wonder whether that is what has pushed Macron to say It'll be 20 years before they get in kind of thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it definitely was, wasn't it? I mean, I think the answer to that question is that what worried Putin much more than NATO. He was actually bluffing when he said that he was worried about the NATO thing. He didn't think NATO was a threat to Russia. The threat is that if Ukraine joined the European Union, there be an example right on the Russian border of a prosperous, more democratic, more European state, and that's really what triggered him in 2014.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Do you wanna pick another question?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Here we are. So, Johnny Deardon, how can the government balance the benefits of rewilding and with those keeping land and communities alive with work and affordable housing.\n\nSpeaker 0: Definitely one for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let let me let me try that one. So people will have followed that, actually, the government's Turn back on the commitment that Boris Johnson made to the conservative environmental movement and, indeed, to his wife Carrie, which is that he was gonna go for A lot of subsidies for more rewilding in Britain, and that has been shelved. And I think one of the reasons for that is something we've talked about in Which is that people are beginning to really worry about food security. It's amazing in Britain. We went for, I think, 12,000,000 Acres under production down to 9,000,000 acres under production taking land out for environmental schemes, and the government's drive was to do ever more of that.\n\nAnd I think this question around food security, the fact that we're not beginning to produce enough food to eat, you know, we hover around 50 Percent of the food we eat is actually produced in the United Kingdom is is making them rethink.\n\nSpeaker 0: We had a a little dispute, yesterday over, Ireland Northern Ireland. And there's a question here.\n\nSpeaker 1: Just tie tiny dispute.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It was tiny. We had a little a little well, I I mean, were we were we a couple, Roy? We would\n\nSpeaker 1: call it the spats. Nothing that listeners like more than 2 middle aged men shouting at each other that someone\n\nSpeaker 0: I wasn't shouting. Are you shouting at me? I wasn't sure.\n\nSpeaker 1: It was great. Instead of me arguing with you, why don't you why don't you inform me about something?\n\nSpeaker 0: Rory, I thought I thought that was just a very agreeable, robust Exchange of of views rooted in our in our in our factual assessments and our passions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Well, let's\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay? Don't be Set, Rory. Don't be upset, please.\n\nSpeaker 1: I gotcha.\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't wanna think that I'm upsetting. That would really, really ruin my day. Okay. I'm not upset. Honestly.\n\nNow. Got it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Got it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now tell us When you're in when you're in government, did you have anything to do with something called the treasury devil?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Tell us about it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Well, the treasury so the treasury devil has got to be the weirdest job title on the planet, and it's the name for a senior outside lawyer who is brought in to advise the government on really, really, really tricky stuff. And at the moment, it's a guy called Sir James Adie. Adie, e a d I e.\n\nSpeaker 1: Who I know a little bit. I remember him I\n\nSpeaker 0: know him.\n\nSpeaker 1: Actually. Yeah. Yeah. He he'd come in as a device. I started meetings where he advised us on stuff back in the day.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. So he's the guy who, if the protocol row not our protocol row, but the protocol row, If it ended up in court, he's the guy who would represent the government. Okay? Now if you wind back, you may remember when this all first became an issue The government, they said they may have to break international law quotes in a limited and specific specific and limited way. And that led to some pretty senior resignations, advocate general, the treasury solicitor.\n\nAnd the lesson the government took was that if you're going to break the law as they're now doing, don't be so stupid as to say that you're doing it. Okay? So the basic plan is unchanged. They're breaking the law, but they went to answer, we must find a lawyer who's telling us that we're not actually breaking the law. And they found the lawyer.\n\nDo you know who it is? No. Suella Braverman, the attorney general. Okay? The one who thinks that Boris Johnson's wonderful.\n\nAnd she invented something called primordial significance, which Rest on the idea rest on the idea that the Good Friday agreement's more than important. The protocol and and the UK single market is more important than European Single market. And this apparently has the nickname BBS in government legal circles, which stands for Braverman bullshit. Okay? It only stands a chance If it's understood, there is no official advice to the contrary.\n\nSo they decided not to ask sir James Eady. But then they were told, I'm afraid you're going to have to ask, sir James Eady, because he's been involved in this the whole way through. So they asked him, But they asked him to, quote, assume that the policy is lawful. Okay? That was the instruction he got.\n\nSo he's like, okay. I assume the policy is lawful. But he wrote his response in such a way that anybody who reads it is absolutely clear that he thinks their approach, lacks credibility, isn't lawful and is not legally solid solid. So having had got the advice they wanted from the utterly political Sohail O'Braveman, They now know there is a paper lying around which would almost certainly get raised in court, and there you would have acting for the government, The man who is absolutely clear that what the government is doing is not lawful, which is a total, total mess.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's amazing.\n\nSpeaker 0: When Yeah. When James Cleverley, The ill named James Cleverley was summoned to the council of commerce to explain this. He hid behind the whole, we never talk about legal advice to the government. But, of course, that would be true in a normal functional government where legal advice doesn't leak, but this lot leak like sieves. So it's now out there all around the government and legal circles within government that James Eadie basically thinks this thing is absolute nonsense.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's amazing. And it's all I I I saw the leak, and it's all couched in this weird civil service language. But he says he finds it more convincing reading the Singh, reading the argument that it's breaking international law.\n\nSpeaker 0: We know what that if you're a journalist Getting hold of that. I think you know what it means, don't you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Beautiful.\n\nSpeaker 0: Which this is Euna Mugabe. Which former politician has gone on to do most good in the world? Now I would argue that both Tony and Gordon have actually done lots of good stuff, on not least through the work they do through policy development stuff, but I think I'm gonna pick out Jimmy Carter on that. I think Jimmy Carter has been an extraordinary post presidential president, and he still sort of keeps going.\n\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Amazing. And I I think to some extent, Mandela was probably the most dramatic example, wasn't he? I mean, he's somebody that you admire a lot, and we've talked about it\n\nSpeaker 0: a lot. He yeah. He's dead, though.\n\nSpeaker 1: He is certainly dead. We're talking about living politicians. Sorry.\n\nSpeaker 0: Al Gore Al Gore, I think, has done some amazing stuff on the environment, out of power.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. And And it's interesting how they do it in different ways. I Gordon Brown, I think, has done it very, very quietly, very responsibly, very, very seriously. And there's been much less the kind of razzmatazz that surrounds, you know, Al Gore or or some of the biggest celebrity politicians.\n\nSpeaker 0: You don't you you I'm I'm detecting you're not really liking Tony in you these days, Rory. I'm sort of just detecting something here.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm fascinated by Tony Blair. I'm really fascinated by him, and I'm fascinated by the extent to which he remains so deeply, deeply involved in British politics And the way in which he has, still retains an uncanny ability to seize headlines, seize debates, the way in which he'll suddenly Take positions that are very, very timely or make a speech.\n\nSpeaker 0: That's because he's strategic. They're both strategic. And and\n\nSpeaker 1: it I think\n\nSpeaker 0: it is\n\nSpeaker 1: It is it is fascinating, but I do sometimes I've never I tell you what I've never really forgiven him for. I tell you let's get to the depth of my resentment. I've never really forgiven him for the fact that when Theresa May announced the withdrawal agreement, he was straight out there on that morning, and he said, I'm forming an unholy alliance with Boris Johnson to kill this. We both agree that this is the worst of all worlds. Now he thought that by destroying it, what he'd do is he'd have a second referendum, and we could remain in the European Union.\n\nBut what he actually did is destroy destroy any chances of beating the ARG and Boris. And I thought Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: It was really\n\nSpeaker 1: really ill considered, and I thought it was catastrophic.\n\nSpeaker 0: Would you do you add me to the to the unforgiven list? Because I'd No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I forgive you because I because I like and love you, and I know you.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now talking of, Former leaders, Chris Murgatroyd, who was your most feared opponent in terms of quick wit? And I'm gonna go there for for William Hague. Of all the leaders that Tony faced, William Hague was the one Who in parliament, in PMQs, got closest to even beginning to unsettle Tony, and there he did it through his extraordinary wit. And the thing is, though, I think I may have I may have told you this before. We we disarmed him by developing a line about William Hague, that he was all jokes and no judgment.\n\nAnd as a result of that, he stopped doing the jokes, and he stopped being witty, and therefore, he was weakened. But he was, for me, the most quick witted, opponent. What about you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Good. Very good. Very good. I think being funny is really important.\n\nI I I mean, look. He's not not, he's not a kind of necessarily big name, but I thought, for For example, Chris Bryant was very good at being funny at the right moments.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: I Yeah. I think humor in parliament is hugely important. I mean, it was one of the things sadly went wrong for Keir Samer in his PMQs. You remember he said as part of his intervention, oh, dear. And the Tory backbenchers suddenly caught in that and started saying, oh, dear, oh, dear all the way through It's incredible how people got unsettled.\n\nHey. Here's a question for John Brown. Same subject. Is there any value in PMQs? Questions are rarely answered, and it seems like it's more about theatrical performance.\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, I think if we start saying there's no value in promises questions, we might as well give up on democracy. I think it has become very showbiz. What I used to like about PMQs when I was Working with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, I used to see it as a strategic anvil. This is where strategies get hammered out. It's where you really find out whether you've got a strong argument in a line of attack or not.\n\nAnd I'll tell you the other thing it does. I don't think with this government, because I don't think this is a functional government, and I think Johnson functions as a functional prime minister. But Tony used prime minister's questions as a way of driving the government machine. We would demand things from I think quite a lot of government departments were terrified of us on Tuesdays and Wednesday mornings because we were demanding Facts and detail and data and information and explanations, and we'd be going back saying this isn't good enough. And so I think that using prime minister's questions, not just for the kind of half hour event that it is, but actually as a strategic anvil A driver of government.\n\nThat's where I think it was\n\nSpeaker 1: very important. I couldn't agree more. And, actually, it was the lesson that it took me a long time to learn as a minister. I'd probably been in 7, 8 years before I realized that the most powerful thing that you have is using parliament, using your public statements to take that mandate And use that with government and civil service rather than trying to argue every point privately, point by point inside your office using those public moments to drive it through.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I was gonna say that the the the the other thing I was I would say about that is that prime minister's questions is this is the the other reason, I think, Johnson's sort of, lack of contact with the truth is a real problem because one of the other things that a prime minister and a minister can say is, I cannot say that if it's not true, So go and get me the facts. And Tony was absolutely he was that he would shout every Wednesday morning, I just want the facts. And You get the facts, and then you can start to make the political argument.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's go for our break. Coming straight back in from the break here, I think a lovely point that you made there about pushing for the facts. I think one of the things that I notice sometimes with civil servants is that people I'd ask them a question. They'd say, well, I don't think you really want to say that, minister.\n\nSo they wouldn't give me the information, and I'd have to push back and say, look. Give me the facts, and then I'll decide what to say. You can trust me not Savings, but I need to understand what the truth is behind this. I'm not going out there with you having concealed from me the bad news for fear that I might admit it when I'm on the public stage.\n\nSpeaker 0: There's a great question here from Steve Miles. Yeah. You know, we talked recently about how we were slightly downplayed Wales. Yeah. Steve Miles question.\n\nNetflix did an advert for a documentary about the mine a film about the miner's strike, which they said took place in Wales, comma, England. What what impressions do you guys get of how Wales and the rest of the UK are seen around the world? Of course, it's not just you know, I talk to people in Great Britain, British people who think that Northern Ireland is part of Great Britain, not the United Kingdom. I'll tell you the other thing. Even the French, The French are the worst at this.\n\nThey still talk about long le terre, la reinde dans le terre, le gouvernemente dans le terre as though Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland don't exist. It really really gets my gut.\n\nSpeaker 1: We're we're we're a complete muddle, aren't we, as a country? And and I I noticed that Sometimes some of my colleagues use the word England when they mean Great Britain or when they mean United Kingdom. It's it's we we are in a complete model. Right. Here's a question for you.\n\nLisa, I'm curious as a languages teacher in a land of English speakers, what languages do you both speak, and how and why did you learn them? Alastair, you're the language man.\n\nSpeaker 0: I speak fluent French. I used to speak fluent German, and I'm trying to get it back. I speak a tiny bit of Dutch, And I speak a tiny bit of Gaelic. I learned Gaelic as a child because my dad taught me even though we were growing up in Yorkshire. I speak French and German because I loved it at school, and I went on to do it at university.\n\nAnd I I love speaking French and German. I wish I spoke Chinese, and I wish I spoke Arabic, but I don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: And are you gonna are you gonna are you gonna try to pick up another language? You're gonna deepen your Gaelic or try to pick up a new one?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, funnily enough, I offered I I suggested this idea as a documentary. I'm doing a big TV project at the moment, which I'm not allowed to talk about, but I'm I I did suggest this idea a while ago of trying to do a thing where I would go up. I thought b b Scotland might have jumped at it, where I would learn try and sort of speed learn Gaelic and see whether I could get up to a reasonable level because it's such a different language to English. It really is very, very different. But I'd love to learn Arabic, but I I don't know whether I'm a bit too old now.\n\nWhat about what language do you speak?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I I speak a lot of languages very, very, very badly, And they're getting worse all the time. It's not like you. I didn't study them properly. I I have studied at different times. I think 11 different languages.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And\n\nSpeaker 1: and in some of them, I can kinda get by. And some of them, I'm like somebody said it's like talking to an Uber driver who's been living in Britain for about 6 months.\n\nSpeaker 0: What do you speak? Which one do you speak best?\n\nSpeaker 1: I probably I think my best language is probably Indonesian When I was really concentrating on it. Right. And then Right. Probably French. Oh, Dari, I was fine chatting.\n\nI mean, I think my real strength People like Shoshana, my wife, get really annoyed with me because she is much much better at the grammar, but she says I'm much better at understanding people. I can understand almost everything that anybody is saying to me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Jenny, the other day, I was watch on the on the day of the the French parliamentary elections, I was I I was watching France France 24, the English language version, and they had 2 French presenters and 4 French politicians We were all speaking utterly flawless English. And I thought, I can't imagine if we were doing, if there was a a a a French version of the BBC that we would be able to get for politicians who could speak fluent French like that.\n\nSpeaker 1: Am I right that Tony Blair spoke very good French, did he? Sorry?\n\nSpeaker 0: Pretty good. He did a speech to one of the scare the times I tow saw Tony Blair absolutely terrified was when he did a speech in French at the National Assembly. I think Tony would accept his French is not quite as good as mine, but it's better than most.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Here's a question from Sharon Metz. How can a green agenda sit next to the rising cost of living.\n\nSpeaker 0: Go on.\n\nSpeaker 1: God. Blimey. Thanks. I think it's it's it's a really it's a really good challenge. Listen.\n\nThe the the the the answer is that Many of these agendas were not happening at a time when there were these kinds of economic pressures. So we have one example which we talked about in yesterday's show, Which is the, the the challenge of trying to weigh up land use. You know, how do you balance rewilding against, productive agriculture? I think there are real questions, faced in Germany for the moment, whether you use coal to generate power more cheaply when people are facing rising fuel prices. Anna, I think, sadly, it is going to put a lot of pressure on many of the expenditures we need to make on climate because there's always attention between the short term and the long term, and that becomes much more intense when people are facing inflation at 10%.\n\nSpeaker 0: The government has clearly diluted to the point of not irrelevance, but substantially diluted the Dimbleby food review. He sounded very dispirited when he was talking about it on the on the radio the other day.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think that's right. I think that's right. Okay. Jeff Spink, how will Putin's hunger strategy unfold?\n\nAre we gonna have to ensure safe passage through the Black Sea with a naval presence and mine clearing capability? Goodness gracious to me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, listen. This is why I think the we we we should be really focused on a longer term thinking about about the whole immigration issue. I mean, I I've come to the conclusion this is all deliberate, And part of the consequence that he wants is to create famine and to create, even greater refugee streams coming our way, coming to the to the Western Europe. And I really don't think we talked we talked about food security in the context of the UK. What is the global food security strategy?\n\nWhat are the UN doing? What are the what's the World Food Organization doing there? And I'm not saying that as a critical way. I'm just asking that as a question. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's it's it's heartbreaking. You you you you've probably been following that Somalia is now in its 4th year of drought and famine. And and I I remember, I suppose it was 4 years ago, being in hospitals In Somalia and seeing women bringing in babies who were dying and women who'd lost a child crossing the desert on their way in. And If you're looking for an argument for international development and the reason why I backed the 0.7% and didn't want deferred merged, You really feel it there, and you're gonna feel it in Kenya. And very sadly, it's quite possible there's gonna be rain no rain this The end of this year either in Somalia.\n\nAnd it's barely funded, as you say.\n\nSpeaker 0: But it's it's quite it's quite horrible to think that I I mean, even though we've had some really bad people in history and there's some bad people in the world today, but you've got a guy sitting there now who's thought, right, well, I've you know, I was on the back foot for quite time, but I've got away with it. I'm still here. The sanctions aren't really destroying the economy in the way that they thought they might. The world is starting to Get a bit bored with Ukraine. I'm fracturing the European alliance.\n\nThe Americans are still sort of pumping all the weapons, but, you know, I can sit that out. And meanwhile, if I start, you know, messing around with the grain the flow of grain around the world from Russia and Ukraine, I can both On the from the Russian side, I can keep the economy going maybe, but because, you know, they're they're also selling a lot of stolen grain. They're they're selling stolen Ukrainian grain as well. But equally, I can, you know, starve a few people and they're all you know, they want they're gonna have to start crossing borders and there'll be all chaos. I mean, it is pretty horrible to think that's what he's actually That's part of his plan now.\n\nIt's awful.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and I think, you know, maybe it's a a way to conclude, but, I mean, I think it's a reminder of how Very fragile, vulnerable the world's system is in ways that we maybe didn't acknowledge 10, 20 years ago, how interdependent we are, And how everything from feeding starving people in Somalia through to keeping our semiconductor chips going depended on a peaceful relatively peaceful open global trading system.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I think we should fit I should I think we shouldn't finish with that. It's a bit down. But, like, can we finish with this one from Paul Paul Heaney? When you 2 are working overseas, what is your actual job?\n\nWhat kind of organization is employing you? Well, I can say I'm Absolutely self employed. I travel around the world advising, speaking. I do a lot of my mental health stuff overseas. I'm actually They're off to Dublin tomorrow for a a mixture of speaking and politics.\n\nSo I'm self employed, unemployed, call it what you want. What about you, Roy?\n\nSpeaker 1: So I'm actually been, mostly working abroad unpaid. I've been very, very lucky, which is that I was receiving a salary from Yale University to teach, And I make some money from this wonderful podcast, and that's allowed me to be able to volunteer for the last couple years, working with the charity recently in Jordan Syrian refugees and working with charities in Africa. At some point, if I if I start, yep, if I start doing more of it, I may start being paid.\n\nSpeaker 0: Good. Well, that would be very well deserved as you continue to spread eau de cologne, English eau de cologne around the world.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Alastair, and much love. And sorry about our argument yesterday.\n\nSpeaker 0: Never apologize, Rory. It was just it was part do I have look. Do I have to keep teaching you to toughen up. You didn't need to apologize. You you stood your ground.\n\nYou expressed your opinion forcibly. You were wrong, but that's your prerogative.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, and goodbye.\n\nSpeaker 0: See you next week.\n\nSpeaker 1: See you next week.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bye bye.",
