Welcome to another episode of the rest of politics question time with me, Alastair Campbell. And with me, Rory Stewart. Here I am, still in still in New York, and I'm gonna begin with a question, which I think is very topical. So friend of the show doesn't wanna be named, says, What are Alastair Rory's thoughts on India expelling a senior Canadian diplomat after Trudeau suggested Delhi may have been involved in the murder of a Sikh Separatist leaders suggest to remind people of what happened here. It's a pretty astonishing moment. A prominent Sikh activist In Canada, was gunned down by 2 masked men in the street, and the Canadian government has now said they have credible evidence of the involvement of the Indian government, Narendra Modi's government, in assassinating a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil and have expelled the senior ended up Look. We're we're we're talking we're talking on the main podcast about impunity. We've had situations in in the UK where The Russians have, wiped out people here. We had a situation up in Manchester where Chinese diplomats were diplomats in quotes were involved in taking action against their own people on British soil. And I think if you go back to some of the discussions we've had in recent weeks about Modi, I think there is a real worry about the extent to which Modi is becoming more and more, how do we put it, extreme in his positions. And often, if you become extreme in your positions, you become extreme in your actions. And I don't believe that Trudeau, I mean, Trudeau would be absolutely well aware of the consequences of him coming out and calling this out. So I suspect when he says credible allegations of a link between the deaths and the Indian state. I don't think he'd say that lightly. We should point out that India has made clear in their view that what Trudeau is saying is assert that it is not true that they wiped out this guy on the streets of Canada. Yeah. Well, of course, I mean, this is a very deep issue. And when I was a minister, the It's a strong issue about a British citizen who had been, effectively kidnapped by the Indian government and was, there were credible allegations around his torturers, again, a Sikh. There are very long standing issues between the Sikh community and the Indian government With the Indian security agencies very involved. And and, of course, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in her home in New Delhi by 2 of her bodyguards who were Sikhs who are protesting against the actions that she'd taken against the Golden Temple in Amritsar. And tensions between Punjab and Delhi are very strong at the moment partly because A lot of the air pollution in Delhi is blamed on crop burning Punjab, etcetera. So there are many aces in the background, but I think the most important issue is that to assassinate in that way, And in particular, it's a brutal public out of the back of a van machine gunning somebody down the streets in a friendly country is a step that I would never have expected the Indian government to take. I mean, that's going into full Russia territory. Yeah. Just to give people the issue that that that's at the heart of this, The guy who's been killed is called Nijjar. He he'd been campaigning for something called Kalistan, which is the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region, and clearly that is something that Moody doesn't like. Now we don't know. We you and I and none of our listeners have any clue as to who these people were that gunned him down. But I in a way that I probably would be a little bit skeptical of listening to Modi's denials, I do attach a certain amount of credibility to something like Trudeau standing up and saying what he said. Now, Kariad, Can you talk about the protests in Brussels happening over compulsory sex education? Well, it's not just in Brussels. This is happening in several parts of of Belgium. Have you been following this one, Rory? No. Tell us about it. Essentially, what has happened is that there have been a number of arson attacks on schools that have been teaching, sex education. And the prime minister, Alexander de Kreu, he's actually called in the government experts on extremism after a I think 6 schools now have been torched. And this is something called the Evora program. And this is where children in schools are required to take 4 hours of sex education, split between aged 11 to 12 and 15 to 16. Now you wouldn't think that was very dramatic or very radical, But it's gone from being voluntary, which it was, to now being compulsory because they feel that they've got issues of sexual health and sexual education that they need to address. And it's led to a number of of schools being attacked. It's led to divisions with, some Islamic groups who have complained that this is all about the what they call hypersexualization of their children. And if, You know, back to our friend misinformation, online conspiracy theories, all sorts of nonsense has been flooding the Internet that what this Programme Everett is about is actually sort of sexualizing children, teaching children age 5 to be, you know, sexually active and all this sort of nonsense. So the government is out there trying to damp down all these rumors, and in the meantime, they're addressing a number of cases of arson. So it's pretty worrying. And the the the local mayor in One of the areas where this happened has said this isn't, no better and worse sort to than terrorism. It is terrorism. Yeah. Well, it's very striking. I I when here in the States, I was talking to A group of people involved in the Biden, Trump campaigns over the last couple of days, and I was making the point that I saw economics being central to the fact that the 2008 financial crisis, globalization had had such a bad impact on the incomes of many people in marginal bits of the US. They came back with 2 things. I mean, one is they pointed out that actually incomes now outside London and the southeast in the UK are somewhere between Mississippi and Alabama. In other words, we have very extreme version of the same thing. But also they said that it's a mistake to see much of what Trump is doing in terms of economics. It's largely culture war stuff. And, of course, it's it's very much what the Suellen Brahmins tendency in the conservative party lent into and that Boris Boris Johnson was trying to lean into whenever he was sending people out to talk about statues that there is a sense in which something about the modern political landscape means that you can get a long way in politics Talking about sex education or transgender issues or in the US issues around abortion rather than focusing on issues like how you regulate I AI or sort out the economy. Let's bring it home. Jeremy Corbyn, Anouk h. On Wednesday's podcast, Rory said Jeremy Corbyn has a problem with anti semitism, but should not have been dismissed from Labour due to his status history within the party. Isn't that like arguing that Luis Rubialis has an issue with sexual harassment, but shouldn't be dismissed for the same reason? We talked a bit about the your interview with Navara Media last week, and we talked a bit about it in our trips to Scotland and Bath. The the background first. I gave an interview to Enviromedia where I said that I thought it was mad and disgusting that Keir Salma had Effectively, de facto expelled Jeremy Corbyn from parliament. And I guess I was reflecting on Institutional point that I care about a great deal. And, obviously, maybe I care about it too much because Boris Johnson did the same thing to me and to Twenty other MPs who rebelled against, his version of a no deal Brexit. The point is that in the British system, there are two reasons why leaders should not Be able to expel MPs. One of them is that in a first past the post system, our parties need to be quite broad coalitions because the electoral doesn't deliver diversity in parliament. But the 2nd more important constitutional reason is that we don't have a proper separation between the legislature and the executive. And the only way in which we can have a functioning parliament is if members of parliament have considerable freedom towards their leaders and are able To exercise it. Otherwise, you end up basically with a kind of elective dictatorship. But the parties do have rules? Yeah. Absolutely. So I I would say that maybe, you know, choosing Jeremy Corbyn as my hill to die on, was a was an eccentric thing to do. But I still hold to the point which is absolutely there was horrifying anti semitism in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. Jeremy Corbyn equivocated around the report that was produced on anti semitism, and I think Keir Starmer is absolutely right To make it clear that he's gonna root out anti semitism in the Labour Party. But there is a constitutional point which is that MPs should be removed Through legal processes, through parliamentary committees, but I don't think it's appropriate for them to be removed by their leaders. And one of the reasons for that is that Actually, what it does is very quickly play into the labor left who feel that this is an alibi which is being brought together for Sarma to assert his Power of the Party. And, obviously, I was hit very hard on this. I got attacked very hard by members of the Jewish community who said I was being Insensitive to anti Semitism, and I was also attacked very hard by the Jeremy Corbyn left who said that I was giving in to People by saying that there was anti semitism in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party, so I was being attacked very hard from both sides, and it's a very strange experience on social media to do that. If there's any consolation, Roy, I was being attacked for not attacking you enough, and I was also being attacked for attacking you too much. So I think it's just one of those issues that It's very hard to have a a rational debate. But there was another question from somebody called Aaron who just said, you know, you've you've kind of half addressed this. Has Roy read the EHRC report into the Labour Party and Corbyn's response to it. Corbyn was offered a way back in by apologizing or withdrawing, but he simply refused. And I think that is the point. It's not that Keir Starmer was withdrawing the whip, kicking him out of the party because of being Jeremy Corbyn. It was the fact that he would not accept the process that they put in place. I'm afraid we live in a world we have an unwritten constitution, and that means that we have to depend on unwritten rules and conventions. And before Boris Johnson Yeah. But the Labour Party has a written constitution. The Labour Party has a rule. But aside from the Labour Party's written constitution, leaders before Boris Johnson did not Acts that de facto expel their MPs. And the reason why it's a de facto expulsion is in a first past the post system. If you're stripped of the party whip and you try to stand again, it's almost impossible to get Back into parliament. So we have to be realistic about what's happening here, which is gonna be very difficult for Jeremy Corbyn now to remain in parliament. And I do think there's a tendency now, And this was started by Johnson to say, well, is the leader right or wrong? So his supporters would say, in relation to throwing out me and Ken Clarke and Winston Churchill's Grandson and 5 cabinet ministers and the rest. Well, all that matters is that we were on the wrong side on Brexit, and Boris had to get stuff done, had to drive through his no deal Brexit. It's also one of the reasons I'm getting upset at the moment about the fact that Biden is supporting the use of cluster munitions In Russia and Ukraine, when I say I'm completely against cluster munitions, people say, do you want Russia to win? And I'm saying, no. I'm not saying I want Russia to win. I'm saying that we'd spend a long time bringing together conventions on trying to stop people doing this sort of thing. And sometimes you are able and it's a difficult thing to say in the modern social media ratio. You're Able simultaneously to say, I profoundly disagree with Jeremy Corbyn. There was anti Semitism in Corbyn State Party, but also and this is a a something Jonathan Sumption, who's a judge, has said, Leaders should not be expelling MPs from their parties in this way. Alastair, lots more questions come. Let's just take a quick break. Question for you. Rob Wright, we have slipped Inextricably from cabinet government, remember when secretaries of state used to make policy announcements, to a presidential style where number 10 and the PM decide and announce everything, But our institutions haven't kept pace. How can we trigger a review, stroke, reset of the constitution? Oh, I think if we were having a review, stroke, reset of the constitution, which I think we talked about that in Bath, didn't we? I'd like to start with a blank piece of paper. But on that specific point, I guess what the question is about is the the reassertion of parliamentary authority as parliament being the place where ministers set out plans to the country. And, you know, we got criticized a lot for bypassing parliament. I don't believe that we did. But I think what's changed is the 20 4 7 media age and now social media on top of it is that the policy development process is very, very hard to keep a little on it. People, I'm afraid, people talk far too much, and they talk far too much about decisions as they're being made as opposed to when the decision is made, and therefore, it makes it very difficult for a policy decision to be made in parliament. The truth is we've gone way too far in the wrong direction. So, for example, if you go back to the last Budget, I don't think there was anything on the day. Now, Pete, the chancellors used to resign for the slightest hint of the budget being leaked, But now it's just become sort of par for the course of the budget. It gets sort of trotted out through the newspapers. And it totally hollows out the significance of parliament. I mean, you know, it's More and more difficult to make journalists concentrate on what's happening in parliament. If nobody's concentrating, the standard of speeches drops. MPs don't bother to attend the chamber. The whole thing feels completely useless. And one of the few ways of keeping parliament central is to make sure that the big announcements are made and challenged in parliament. Absolutely. And you can do that, by the way, even as the all the stuff is going around being dribbled out and leaked out. I think as long as the number 10 machine is basically saying, well, that's not coming from us. And you're saying, you know, we'll set this out next Tuesday, and people can blather away all they want, but that's when we're going to do it. And I hope that Keir Starmer, if he does become prime minister, It does reassert that. Who comes up with Starmer's gags? This is from somebody called Mark Eggie. Starmer's inaction man gag was pretty good. This is when he called, soon after in Action Man. Will he have come up with that himself, or will he have got it from a colleague or aide? Do leaders take these sorts of quips from the public on local visits? What what are the best gags can you remember? Were any of them given to you? I remember. Well, give us give us I mean, so you you were talking about one of your favorite speeches, which you selected for Hansard as one of your Then one of the 100 best speeches of all time was John Smith. John Smith. So tell us a bit about his gag. It wasn't really a gag. I mean, the the the headline of the speech or what came the headline of the speech. It was John Major, the man with the non Midas touch. And John had done this whole litany of things that had gone wrong, And he said, no wonder we live in a country where the Grand National doesn't start and hotels fall into the sea. Because that week, the Grand National hadn't started. There'd be the false start, and they had to get all the horses back. And also a hotel in Scarborough had fallen into the sea, which actually is quite sad for the people whose hotel it was, but John turned it into into a joke and a sort of metaphor. I mean, it's interesting about speechwriting. The reason I laughed when I read the question out was because I used to ask comedians for jokes for conference speeches. And, Roy Hudd. Do you remember Roy Hudd? No. Don't remember Roy Hudd. You must remember Roy Hudd. Well, Roy Hudd used to give us some very, very funny very funny lines, And some of them were just a bit too near the mark, so we used to go through his jokes. We used some of them. I can't remember what they were. We did use some of them. But the thing about I don't know if you were like this as a as a speaker. I I mean, Tony Blair is quite a serious guy, but for a party conference speech, he wanted at least 3 or 4 really good laughs. Now I'm quite good at one liners, and I'm quite good at telling funny stories. But, You know, sometimes you you do you go out to you go out to the professionals. Anyway, what happened was that I can't remember how it got out, but Somebody told the press that we were abusing Roy Hart, and all of a sudden, there was all this talk about, you know, we were a joke and blah blah blah blah blah. So you gotta be careful with it. But yeah. And, also, the thing about getting them from people, the public on local visits, keeping your ears open to what people are saying about other politicians is sometimes worth doing because You can get very, very good lines from what the public is saying about them. Finland's former PM, sir Unimata Kukanen, What's your view about Finland's former PM, Sanna Marin, leaving the parliament so soon after the elections, contradicting her own assurances that she'll commit to work As an MP and taking job at Tony Blair Institute, this is something that I think is a bit sad in British politics and something that I've always admired Theresa May for doing, which is that she's remained in parliament. And she's going to stay for the next election. And kept working as a back match MP, and I think that's a really good thing, and I I was one of the things I wrote about in in, Politics on the Edge is that when David Cameron was interviewing me to be an MP, he said if he ever stopped being prime minister he would continue as the MP for Whitney for the rest of his life. And, of course, he stepped down almost immediately. Well, what do you think about this tendency of people saying they're gonna stay on as MPs and then heading out? Well, I can say in my old boss Tony Blair's defense is that he always said that he was not going to hang around in parliament. He felt that prime minister's hanging around. It made it very difficult for the departing prime minister, but, also, it could make it more difficult for the the prime minister who followed. So he felt it was the best thing to do. I think if you say you're going to stay, frankly, it's better that you stay. But, You know, the the fact the fact that somebody like Sanna Marin, I think she's still only in her thirties. I think she's 37. So she's a former prime minister aged 37. Now I assume she could go back into parliament. She could go back into politics. Perhaps she's made a judgment that the things that she's particularly interested in pursuing, She can do it better now on a with a a more international focus, and I guess working for Tony Blair's Institute will give her access and opportunities. I think she'd probably have had those anyway, as a former prime minister. I will, at least, now that she's in London, Rory, I think she's very, very on the show. Definitely a very interesting prospect for the, for leading. So we'll we'll go down that road. The fact is leaders are becoming leaders of countries much younger than they used to, And I think it means that the idea of people like, if somebody like her to sort of do a Ted Heath and hang around the Finnish parliament the rest of live, I can see why that would have been pretty unappealing. But it's also partly, I'm afraid, that politics has become such a brutal and unpleasant business that, You know, somebody like Gladstone, it was a relatively high status, low stress shop sometimes, and it was something that you could imagine him stepping down as prime minister, remaining on the backbenches, giving it Few years coming back in again as prime minister. I was talking to one of President Obama's aids and he was saying How sad it is to get a sense that president Obama is a bit directionless, has slightly lost faith in the ability to really advocate the center ground in politics that there is a real sense of pessimism and degradation in a lot of these countries. And I think one of the Reasons Theresa May is so impressive is the way in that she just hangs on in there and keeps standing for the kind of things that she got into politics Do, but I think for many other people, and presumably, Saint Amarin is one of them, and it's presumably true for the ex prime minister of New Zealand too that it's just so bizarre and horrible politics at the moment. You're asking a lot for people to to keep slogging away for the rest of their lives. But it has look. It either has to turn better or worse. And I I think that one of the themes of your book and one of the themes of, you know, when we talked about Truss and Johnson, it's hard to imagine our apologies is is not going to get better in some way. You mentioned the the Tory and Labour candidates that you met in when they came out to see you in Jordan, and I I met them as well, at the Ditchy Foundation. And I I actually was quite encouraged by the sort of people they were, the sort of qualities. I mean, you know, you're making very quick judgments because you're just having a few small short chats with people. But I was pleased that that the sort of people that I met, former soldiers, former business people, doctor, different a vet, different sorts of people who still felt, despite knowing all they know about apologies, I still want to go in and try and make a difference. And I think, eventually, we will hopefully make a turn turn for the better. Talking about MPs, here's a here's a good question, which you you maybe have a better answer than I would. Emailing my MP, Tom Billington. I'm emailing to us as I'm at a complete loss and disillusion with this country. For the first time in my life, I've emailed my MP, Tulip Sadik, Labour. And I just wanted to know from you what good this really does. What can I expect? Will it actually help? It's It's a good question, though, isn't it? Now he attached the email he sent to Tulip Sadeep, which is that he'd waited for 9 hours in A&E before he was seen for a broken nose. What What do you think? I mean, I regularly say to people, write to your MP. Do you think it does make any difference? Well, it's it's very difficult to know. I mean, one of the things is the volume's gone up. So Willie Whitelaw, who was my predecessor's predecessor and my constituency, received, his secretary said, 6 letters a week, on the board. To them all handwritten in the library. I counted in my 1st year in parliament, I received 27,000 emails from constituents in a year. That's out of Only about 70,000 voters. And how how hold on. How many of those would have been organized lobbies? How many of those would have been, you know, pro fox hunting or anti fox hunting or pro fracking or anti fracking. Maybe 30, 40%, not as many as you'd think. But but you're right. There's those, And those are weird because you'll receive 300 identical emails which you then have to reply to. I mean, it's important to understand that once the volume gets And if you're getting 5, 600 in a week, it's not reasonable to believe that the MP is actually drafting the replies to every one of those emails. So they Yeah. What you end Whether there's big teams in your private office drafting, and then what I would do is I'd read through the reply and I'd edit it, or I'd add something at the beginning or the end, or I'd reject it if I didn't like it. But the work of the draft is being done by other people. I mean, the other thing that was odd about it is that, of course, MPs don't have power of that sort. You know, we're not allowed to Interferon. If you, Tulip Sadiq, was to ring up the a and e and say, look, my constituent's stuck at the back of the mic. Can you put them up the front of the line, she would get a pretty surety response from the hospital. And the same is true if, you know, if you intervene on an immigration case, the home office writes It's one of the good things about the British system and says, oi, we're not having political interference. And what goes on? MPs don't have budgets. MPs don't have power in their constituencies. The power of an MP is to vote on legislation in parliament. Now it is true that when I wrote on behalf of constituents, nevertheless, What it does do is often make civil servants look for a second time at a case. And in perhaps almost half of cases, I was Very struck that we were able to get things done by making the civil servant look at 2nd time at some injustice that had been done to a constituent. That injustice was righted, but it did make me wonder, is this a sensible way of proceeding? Because effectively, the people who are lucky enough to get in to see the MP in the surgery have a 5050 Chance of having a case turned around. Those that don't get to see the MP and are following the normal process, the normal procedures don't. So I had a lot of questions about whether this is a sensible way to run a country. Yeah. I I thought one of the interesting parts of our conversation with the 2 Andys, Andy Burnham and Andy Street, the mayors of, Manchester and the West Midlands was when Andy Street was saying that he thought, actually, it was it was harder to be the mayor with a government of the same party. And I wonder sometimes whether for an MP, is it easier or harder if you're fighting on behalf of a constituent. Because, you know, you might know the minister, but the minister, frankly, isn't gonna give, you know, too much attention to an individual constituency complain. Whereas an opposition MP might be able to generate all sorts of bad publicity for the ministry if they don't. And it also depends whether there's a big majority. I mean, one of the problems is if there's a very Slim majority. You've lost your majority in parliament, then MPs can really exercise often very unfair power. Here's a question I liked, and I'm gonna have a go and then give to you. Adam Serafin, does Rory think that sortition choosing MPs by random lottery from a pool of volunteers is a vile Option from Modern Robotics. I'm very attracted by sortition because it's the basis obviously of juries, that's how juries are selected, and citizens' assemblies. And it's how ancient Athens worked. People were selected by by random lottery. I wouldn't necessarily do it even from a pool of volunteers. I'd I'm very interested in what happens if you do it from the whole public. Now I'm not sure I've fully thought that through, but I do think there's something really about the idea of a genuinely representative sample of people and being more honest about the fact that In a way, what MPs are there to do might be to represent the diversity in our society rather than particular forms of expertise, and it will take the power away from the parties, which I'd like. Maybe you were singing the praises of the New Zealand PR system. Although, we did have a few Kiwis hitting back at that. But Maybe that is the only way that it would work is if you had constituency MPs, but it you also had a different sort of MP who had a different sort of role, which was not basically, which was almost like a sort of a permanent citizens' assembly or a permanent, jury on the parliament. But I I don't think it's as barmy an idea as as some people do. When we were in Bath, by the way, on the way to the, the forum, I went to do a talk in a in a primary school. And one of the children there said to me asked me if I was in favor of keeping the voting age at 18, or would I bring it down? And I said, yeah. I would bring it down. I'd bring it down to 16. And this child in front of me, arm shot straight up and said, why not 5? And I said I said, well, I said, no. Well, you tell me why you think it should be 5, and she said because, Well, listen to how we've been talking to you. We think about these things a lot more than grown ups do. It's quite it's quite a good, It was a fantastic I've got to say, it was a it was a primary school in Jacob Rees Mogg territory, and the kids I I was there for hours. The kids were just nonstop sort of questioning, but and they knew a lot about climate change, and they were very, very worried about it. And We also had a little vote. I didn't even say what I thought about Brexit, Rory. Maybe some of their parents have told me, but we had a little vote on whether we should go back in the European Union, 100% in favor. So very sensible children, I'd say. So question for you, how would Tony Blair's Labour cope now? Patrick Chapman, if Tony Blair's label was coming to power post this conservative party, would they be successful in implementing change? They inherited a decent economy in 97, but it won't be the case now. Yep. That's a very, very good question. I think look. It's it's true. Look. Keir Starmer, if he becomes prime minister, he's not coming into a a very benign economic, landscape. But that's why some of the things that you talked about in your answer on the main podcast about, you know, how labor should project themselves at the next election, about developing an industrial strategy, about having a different sort of commitment to the regions and so forth. It's not all about money in the first stage, is Howard put it. And I think that's what we did. And don't forget, for the 1st 2 years, we did stick to Tory tax spend limits and and and then started to signal the changes, and they made the changes. So I think you can do a lot. I think and I and I so I think Tony would have come in and and wanted to take on some of the big challenges that we have now. I think he probably would make a lot more of science and technology and AI. I think probably would want to rebuild relations with the European Union. But I was very pleased that even though I'm still raging about Brexit and still don't think Labour have called out the Brexit disaster nearly enough, I did since this week, the first signals of of Keir Star, where he did an interview in the Financial Times where he said, you know, when when it comes to renegotiating the trading cooperation agreement, we're going to have to something far better than we've got. So there's an understanding, at least, that this thing's got to be fixed. My final question, We haven't talked about films for a while. Joe says, what films have really touched you both, and what are your favorite films? Oh. Of all the films I've seen recently, I think the one that Touched me the most was belt Kenneth Branagh's Belfast. We're about 3 quarters of the way through the once upon a time in Northern Ireland. I do think Northern Ireland lends itself to amazing human drama, whether documentary or or a a feature film. But I thought I thought Kenneth Branagh's Film captured something incredibly touching about what it's like to be a child growing up surrounded by these these hatreds, and I thought it was Brilliant. I think the film that really touched me, which maybe not everybody's seen, is a film called Call Me by Your Name, which is a 2017 Love Story set in Italy with Timothee Chalamet? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really, really beautiful movie, set in, I guess, the early Early 19 eighties in Northern Italy, but it it's essentially about a young boy falling in love with a a slightly older man, and I think just beautifully paced, beautifully acted. On literature also, I cannot resist saying thank you to you for all your support on the on the sales of book because We've made it number 1, nonfiction hardback, Politics on the Edge. Sold 44,592 copies across all editions in the 1st week. So thank you very much for the support. Well, there you go. Well done. No. That's a that's a big hit. That's a big hit. That's, that that beats my 1st week, I think. So what what what are you reading? We know what you've written. What are you reading? Tom Holland, who does the rest is history podcast and very kind he did in November Meet the Barber Con, has got me on to these McCarran spy books. Which of you have? Yeah. Have you tried them? Absolutely brilliant. I get slagged off for mentioning the lie because it leads to people turning up. But Those of us who are 365, day a year people, there is a sort of camaraderie, and there's quite a lot of sort of book sending around. So, Martin Martin Martin. There are 2 Martins, but Martin knows which Martin this is. This is what the one we call Martin Highgate Cemetery because he does guide he does guided tours if I get cemetery. He got me on to the Mick Heron novels, and they are very, very good. Let me just quickly for people who've not not read them. They're they're set in Slough House, and it's kind of it turns being a spy into living in a sort of grimy sort of version of a dishevelled Kind of regional, I don't know, Social Security Agency. I'm gonna give another plug to the book I mentioned yesterday, Le Piedge. And I'm gonna do it in the context of I'm sure there are lots of people in publishing listen to our podcast. Honestly, an English publisher needs to get a hold of it. It's a very, very good book. You don't understand Putin and what's happened in Ukraine until you really fully understand what he did with Nord Stream. So I'm reading that, and I'm also reading, a a German novel by a guy another another book by a guy called Alex Kapusz, who's not German, actually. I think he's Swiss, but, he writes in German. Very good. Well, thank you, Alastair, very much. See you soon. Bye bye.",

To enjoy ad free listening, receive a weekly newsletter, join our members' chat room, and gain early access to live show Just go to the rest is politics .com. That's the rest is politics.com. Welcome to another episode of the rest of politics question time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: And with me, Rory Stewart. Here I am, still in still in New York, and I'm gonna begin with a question, which I think is very topical. So friend of the show doesn't wanna be named, says, What are Alastair Rory's thoughts on India expelling a senior Canadian diplomat after Trudeau suggested Delhi may have been involved in the murder of a Sikh Separatist leaders suggest to remind people of what happened here. It's a pretty astonishing moment. A prominent Sikh activist In Canada, was gunned down by 2 masked men in the street, and the Canadian government has now said they have credible evidence of the involvement of the Indian government, Narendra Modi's government, in assassinating a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil and have expelled the senior ended up\n\nSpeaker 0: Look. We're we're we're talking we're talking on the main podcast about impunity. We've had situations in in the UK where The Russians have, wiped out people here. We had a situation up in Manchester where Chinese diplomats were diplomats in quotes were involved in taking action against their own people on British soil. And I think if you go back to some of the discussions we've had in recent weeks about Modi, I think there is a real worry about the extent to which Modi is becoming more and more, how do we put it, extreme in his positions.\n\nAnd often, if you become extreme in your positions, you become extreme in your actions. And I don't believe that Trudeau, I mean, Trudeau would be absolutely well aware of the consequences of him coming out and calling this out. So I suspect when he says credible allegations of a link between the deaths and the Indian state. I don't think he'd say that lightly. We should point out that India has made clear in their view that what Trudeau is saying is assert that it is not true that they wiped out this guy on the streets of Canada.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, of course, I mean, this is a very deep issue. And when I was a minister, the It's a strong issue about a British citizen who had been, effectively kidnapped by the Indian government and was, there were credible allegations around his torturers, again, a Sikh. There are very long standing issues between the Sikh community and the Indian government With the Indian security agencies very involved. And and, of course, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in her home in New Delhi by 2 of her bodyguards who were Sikhs who are protesting against the actions that she'd taken against the Golden Temple in Amritsar.\n\nAnd tensions between Punjab and Delhi are very strong at the moment partly because A lot of the air pollution in Delhi is blamed on crop burning Punjab, etcetera. So there are many aces in the background, but I think the most important issue is that to assassinate in that way, And in particular, it's a brutal public out of the back of a van machine gunning somebody down the streets in a friendly country is a step that I would never have expected the Indian government to take. I mean, that's going into full Russia territory.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Just to give people the issue that that that's at the heart of this, The guy who's been killed is called Nijjar. He he'd been campaigning for something called Kalistan, which is the creation of an independent Sikh homeland in the Punjab region, and clearly that is something that Moody doesn't like. Now we don't know. We you and I and none of our listeners have any clue as to who these people were that gunned him down.\n\nBut I in a way that I probably would be a little bit skeptical of listening to Modi's denials, I do attach a certain amount of credibility to something like Trudeau standing up and saying what he said. Now, Kariad, Can you talk about the protests in Brussels happening over compulsory sex education? Well, it's not just in Brussels. This is happening in several parts of of Belgium. Have you been following this one, Rory?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Tell us about it.\n\nSpeaker 0: Essentially, what has happened is that there have been a number of arson attacks on schools that have been teaching, sex education. And the prime minister, Alexander de Kreu, he's actually called in the government experts on extremism after a I think 6 schools now have been torched. And this is something called the Evora program. And this is where children in schools are required to take 4 hours of sex education, split between aged 11 to 12 and 15 to 16. Now you wouldn't think that was very dramatic or very radical, But it's gone from being voluntary, which it was, to now being compulsory because they feel that they've got issues of sexual health and sexual education that they need to address.\n\nAnd it's led to a number of of schools being attacked. It's led to divisions with, some Islamic groups who have complained that this is all about the what they call hypersexualization of their children. And if, You know, back to our friend misinformation, online conspiracy theories, all sorts of nonsense has been flooding the Internet that what this Programme Everett is about is actually sort of sexualizing children, teaching children age 5 to be, you know, sexually active and all this sort of nonsense. So the government is out there trying to damp down all these rumors, and in the meantime, they're addressing a number of cases of arson. So it's pretty worrying.\n\nAnd the the the local mayor in One of the areas where this happened has said this isn't, no better and worse sort to than terrorism. It is terrorism.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, it's very striking. I I when here in the States, I was talking to A group of people involved in the Biden, Trump campaigns over the last couple of days, and I was making the point that I saw economics being central to the fact that the 2008 financial crisis, globalization had had such a bad impact on the incomes of many people in marginal bits of the US. They came back with 2 things. I mean, one is they pointed out that actually incomes now outside London and the southeast in the UK are somewhere between Mississippi and Alabama.\n\nIn other words, we have very extreme version of the same thing. But also they said that it's a mistake to see much of what Trump is doing in terms of economics. It's largely culture war stuff. And, of course, it's it's very much what the Suellen Brahmins tendency in the conservative party lent into and that Boris Boris Johnson was trying to lean into whenever he was sending people out to talk about statues that there is a sense in which something about the modern political landscape means that you can get a long way in politics Talking about sex education or transgender issues or in the US issues around abortion rather than focusing on issues like how you regulate I AI or sort out the economy.\n\nSpeaker 0: Let's bring it home. Jeremy Corbyn, Anouk h. On Wednesday's podcast, Rory said Jeremy Corbyn has a problem with anti semitism, but should not have been dismissed from Labour due to his status history within the party. Isn't that like arguing that Luis Rubialis has an issue with sexual harassment, but shouldn't be dismissed for the same reason? We talked a bit about the your interview with Navara Media last week, and we talked a bit about it in our trips to Scotland and Bath.\n\nSpeaker 1: The the background first. I gave an interview to Enviromedia where I said that I thought it was mad and disgusting that Keir Salma had Effectively, de facto expelled Jeremy Corbyn from parliament. And I guess I was reflecting on Institutional point that I care about a great deal. And, obviously, maybe I care about it too much because Boris Johnson did the same thing to me and to Twenty other MPs who rebelled against, his version of a no deal Brexit. The point is that in the British system, there are two reasons why leaders should not Be able to expel MPs.\n\nOne of them is that in a first past the post system, our parties need to be quite broad coalitions because the electoral doesn't deliver diversity in parliament. But the 2nd more important constitutional reason is that we don't have a proper separation between the legislature and the executive. And the only way in which we can have a functioning parliament is if members of parliament have considerable freedom towards their leaders and are able To exercise it. Otherwise, you end up basically with a kind of elective dictatorship.\n\nSpeaker 0: But the parties do have rules?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Absolutely. So I I would say that maybe, you know, choosing Jeremy Corbyn as my hill to die on, was a was an eccentric thing to do. But I still hold to the point which is absolutely there was horrifying anti semitism in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. Jeremy Corbyn equivocated around the report that was produced on anti semitism, and I think Keir Starmer is absolutely right To make it clear that he's gonna root out anti semitism in the Labour Party.\n\nBut there is a constitutional point which is that MPs should be removed Through legal processes, through parliamentary committees, but I don't think it's appropriate for them to be removed by their leaders. And one of the reasons for that is that Actually, what it does is very quickly play into the labor left who feel that this is an alibi which is being brought together for Sarma to assert his Power of the Party. And, obviously, I was hit very hard on this. I got attacked very hard by members of the Jewish community who said I was being Insensitive to anti Semitism, and I was also attacked very hard by the Jeremy Corbyn left who said that I was giving in to People by saying that there was anti semitism in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party, so I was being attacked very hard from both sides, and it's a very strange experience on social media to do that.\n\nSpeaker 0: If there's any consolation, Roy, I was being attacked for not attacking you enough, and I was also being attacked for attacking you too much. So I think it's just one of those issues that It's very hard to have a a rational debate. But there was another question from somebody called Aaron who just said, you know, you've you've kind of half addressed this. Has Roy read the EHRC report into the Labour Party and Corbyn's response to it. Corbyn was offered a way back in by apologizing or withdrawing, but he simply refused.\n\nAnd I think that is the point. It's not that Keir Starmer was withdrawing the whip, kicking him out of the party because of being Jeremy Corbyn. It was the fact that he would not accept the process that they put in place.\n\nSpeaker 1: I'm afraid we live in a world we have an unwritten constitution, and that means that we have to depend on unwritten rules and conventions. And before Boris Johnson\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But the Labour Party has a written constitution. The Labour Party has a rule.\n\nSpeaker 1: But aside from the Labour Party's written constitution, leaders before Boris Johnson did not Acts that de facto expel their MPs. And the reason why it's a de facto expulsion is in a first past the post system. If you're stripped of the party whip and you try to stand again, it's almost impossible to get Back into parliament. So we have to be realistic about what's happening here, which is gonna be very difficult for Jeremy Corbyn now to remain in parliament. And I do think there's a tendency now, And this was started by Johnson to say, well, is the leader right or wrong?\n\nSo his supporters would say, in relation to throwing out me and Ken Clarke and Winston Churchill's Grandson and 5 cabinet ministers and the rest. Well, all that matters is that we were on the wrong side on Brexit, and Boris had to get stuff done, had to drive through his no deal Brexit. It's also one of the reasons I'm getting upset at the moment about the fact that Biden is supporting the use of cluster munitions In Russia and Ukraine, when I say I'm completely against cluster munitions, people say, do you want Russia to win? And I'm saying, no. I'm not saying I want Russia to win.\n\nI'm saying that we'd spend a long time bringing together conventions on trying to stop people doing this sort of thing. And sometimes you are able and it's a difficult thing to say in the modern social media ratio. You're Able simultaneously to say, I profoundly disagree with Jeremy Corbyn. There was anti Semitism in Corbyn State Party, but also and this is a a something Jonathan Sumption, who's a judge, has said, Leaders should not be expelling MPs from their parties in this way. Alastair, lots more questions come.\n\nLet's just take a quick break. Question for you. Rob Wright, we have slipped Inextricably from cabinet government, remember when secretaries of state used to make policy announcements, to a presidential style where number 10 and the PM decide and announce everything, But our institutions haven't kept pace. How can we trigger a review, stroke, reset of the constitution?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I think if we were having a review, stroke, reset of the constitution, which I think we talked about that in Bath, didn't we? I'd like to start with a blank piece of paper. But on that specific point, I guess what the question is about is the the reassertion of parliamentary authority as parliament being the place where ministers set out plans to the country. And, you know, we got criticized a lot for bypassing parliament. I don't believe that we did.\n\nBut I think what's changed is the 20 4 7 media age and now social media on top of it is that the policy development process is very, very hard to keep a little on it. People, I'm afraid, people talk far too much, and they talk far too much about decisions as they're being made as opposed to when the decision is made, and therefore, it makes it very difficult for a policy decision to be made in parliament. The truth is we've gone way too far in the wrong direction. So, for example, if you go back to the last Budget, I don't think there was anything on the day. Now, Pete, the chancellors used to resign for the slightest hint of the budget being leaked, But now it's just become sort of par for the course of the budget.\n\nIt gets sort of trotted out through the newspapers.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it totally hollows out the significance of parliament. I mean, you know, it's More and more difficult to make journalists concentrate on what's happening in parliament. If nobody's concentrating, the standard of speeches drops. MPs don't bother to attend the chamber. The whole thing feels completely useless.\n\nAnd one of the few ways of keeping parliament central is to make sure that the big announcements are made and challenged in parliament.\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. And you can do that, by the way, even as the all the stuff is going around being dribbled out and leaked out. I think as long as the number 10 machine is basically saying, well, that's not coming from us. And you're saying, you know, we'll set this out next Tuesday, and people can blather away all they want, but that's when we're going to do it. And I hope that Keir Starmer, if he does become prime minister, It does reassert that.\n\nWho comes up with Starmer's gags? This is from somebody called Mark Eggie. Starmer's inaction man gag was pretty good. This is when he called, soon after in Action Man. Will he have come up with that himself, or will he have got it from a colleague or aide?\n\nDo leaders take these sorts of quips from the public on local visits? What what are the best gags can you remember? Were any of them given to you? I remember.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, give us give us I mean, so you you were talking about one of your favorite speeches, which you selected for Hansard as one of your Then one of the 100 best speeches of all time was\n\nSpeaker 0: John Smith.\n\nSpeaker 1: John Smith. So tell us a bit about his gag.\n\nSpeaker 0: It wasn't really a gag. I mean, the the the headline of the speech or what came the headline of the speech. It was John Major, the man with the non Midas touch. And John had done this whole litany of things that had gone wrong, And he said, no wonder we live in a country where the Grand National doesn't start and hotels fall into the sea. Because that week, the Grand National hadn't started.\n\nThere'd be the false start, and they had to get all the horses back. And also a hotel in Scarborough had fallen into the sea, which actually is quite sad for the people whose hotel it was, but John turned it into into a joke and a sort of metaphor. I mean, it's interesting about speechwriting. The reason I laughed when I read the question out was because I used to ask comedians for jokes for conference speeches. And, Roy Hudd.\n\nDo you remember Roy Hudd?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. Don't remember Roy Hudd.\n\nSpeaker 0: You must remember Roy Hudd. Well, Roy Hudd used to give us some very, very funny very funny lines, And some of them were just a bit too near the mark, so we used to go through his jokes. We used some of them. I can't remember what they were. We did use some of them.\n\nBut the thing about I don't know if you were like this as a as a speaker. I I mean, Tony Blair is quite a serious guy, but for a party conference speech, he wanted at least 3 or 4 really good laughs. Now I'm quite good at one liners, and I'm quite good at telling funny stories. But, You know, sometimes you you do you go out to you go out to the professionals. Anyway, what happened was that I can't remember how it got out, but Somebody told the press that we were abusing Roy Hart, and all of a sudden, there was all this talk about, you know, we were a joke and blah blah blah blah blah.\n\nSo you gotta be careful with it. But yeah. And, also, the thing about getting them from people, the public on local visits, keeping your ears open to what people are saying about other politicians is sometimes worth doing because You can get very, very good lines from what the public\n\nSpeaker 1: is saying about them. Finland's former PM, sir Unimata Kukanen, What's your view about Finland's former PM, Sanna Marin, leaving the parliament so soon after the elections, contradicting her own assurances that she'll commit to work As an MP and taking job at Tony Blair Institute, this is something that I think is a bit sad in British politics and something that I've always admired Theresa May for doing, which is that she's remained in parliament.\n\nSpeaker 0: And she's going to stay for the next election.\n\nSpeaker 1: And kept working as a back match MP, and I think that's a really good thing, and I I was one of the things I wrote about in in, Politics on the Edge is that when David Cameron was interviewing me to be an MP, he said if he ever stopped being prime minister he would continue as the MP for Whitney for the rest of his life. And, of course, he stepped down almost immediately. Well, what do you think about this tendency of people saying they're gonna stay on as MPs and then heading out?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I can say in my old boss Tony Blair's defense is that he always said that he was not going to hang around in parliament. He felt that prime minister's hanging around. It made it very difficult for the departing prime minister, but, also, it could make it more difficult for the the prime minister who followed. So he felt it was the best thing to do. I think if you say you're going to stay, frankly, it's better that you stay.\n\nBut, You know, the the fact the fact that somebody like Sanna Marin, I think she's still only in her thirties. I think she's 37. So she's a former prime minister aged 37. Now I assume she could go back into parliament. She could go back into politics.\n\nPerhaps she's made a judgment that the things that she's particularly interested in pursuing, She can do it better now on a with a a more international focus, and I guess working for Tony Blair's Institute will give her access and opportunities. I think she'd probably have had those anyway, as a former prime minister. I will, at least, now that she's in London, Rory, I think she's\n\nSpeaker 1: very, very on the show.\n\nSpeaker 0: Definitely a very interesting prospect for the, for leading. So we'll we'll go down that road. The fact is leaders are becoming leaders of countries much younger than they used to, And I think it means that the idea of people like, if somebody like her to sort of do a Ted Heath and hang around the Finnish parliament the rest of live, I can see why that would have been pretty unappealing.\n\nSpeaker 1: But it's also partly, I'm afraid, that politics has become such a brutal and unpleasant business that, You know, somebody like Gladstone, it was a relatively high status, low stress shop sometimes, and it was something that you could imagine him stepping down as prime minister, remaining on the backbenches, giving it Few years coming back in again as prime minister. I was talking to one of President Obama's aids and he was saying How sad it is to get a sense that president Obama is a bit directionless, has slightly lost faith in the ability to really advocate the center ground in politics that there is a real sense of pessimism and degradation in a lot of these countries. And I think one of the Reasons Theresa May is so impressive is the way in that she just hangs on in there and keeps standing for the kind of things that she got into politics Do, but I think for many other people, and presumably, Saint Amarin is one of them, and it's presumably true for the ex prime minister of New Zealand too that it's just so bizarre and horrible politics at the moment. You're asking a lot for people to to keep slogging away for the rest of their lives.\n\nSpeaker 0: But it has look. It either has to turn better or worse. And I I think that one of the themes of your book and one of the themes of, you know, when we talked about Truss and Johnson, it's hard to imagine our apologies is is not going to get better in some way. You mentioned the the Tory and Labour candidates that you met in when they came out to see you in Jordan, and I I met them as well, at the Ditchy Foundation. And I I actually was quite encouraged by the sort of people they were, the sort of qualities.\n\nI mean, you know, you're making very quick judgments because you're just having a few small short chats with people. But I was pleased that that the sort of people that I met, former soldiers, former business people, doctor, different a vet, different sorts of people who still felt, despite knowing all they know about apologies, I still want to go in and try and make a difference. And I think, eventually, we will hopefully make a turn turn for the better. Talking about MPs, here's a here's a good question, which you you maybe have a better answer than I would. Emailing my MP, Tom Billington.\n\nI'm emailing to us as I'm at a complete loss and disillusion with this country. For the first time in my life, I've emailed my MP, Tulip Sadik, Labour. And I just wanted to know from you what good this really does. What can I expect? Will it actually help?\n\nIt's It's a good question, though, isn't it? Now he attached the email he sent to Tulip Sadeep, which is that he'd waited for 9 hours in A&E before he was seen for a broken nose. What What do you think? I mean, I regularly say to people, write to your MP.\n\nSpeaker 1: Do you\n\nSpeaker 0: think it does make any difference?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's it's very difficult to know. I mean, one of the things is the volume's gone up. So Willie Whitelaw, who was my predecessor's predecessor and my constituency, received, his secretary said, 6 letters a week, on the board. To them all handwritten in the library. I counted in my 1st year in parliament, I received 27,000 emails from constituents in a year.\n\nThat's out of Only about 70,000 voters.\n\nSpeaker 0: And how how hold on. How many of those would have been organized lobbies? How many of those would have been, you know, pro fox hunting or anti fox hunting or pro fracking or anti fracking.\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe 30, 40%, not as many as you'd think. But but you're right. There's those, And those are weird because you'll receive 300 identical emails which you then have to reply to. I mean, it's important to understand that once the volume gets And if you're getting 5, 600 in a week, it's not reasonable to believe that the MP is actually drafting the replies to every one of those emails. So they Yeah.\n\nWhat you end Whether there's big teams in your private office drafting, and then what I would do is I'd read through the reply and I'd edit it, or I'd add something at the beginning or the end, or I'd reject it if I didn't like it. But the work of the draft is being done by other people. I mean, the other thing that was odd about it is that, of course, MPs don't have power of that sort. You know, we're not allowed to Interferon. If you, Tulip Sadiq, was to ring up the a and e and say, look, my constituent's stuck at the back of the mic.\n\nCan you put them up the front of the line, she would get a pretty surety response from the hospital. And the same is true if, you know, if you intervene on an immigration case, the home office writes It's one of the good things about the British system and says, oi, we're not having political interference. And what goes on? MPs don't have budgets. MPs don't have power in their constituencies.\n\nThe power of an MP is to vote on legislation in parliament. Now it is true that when I wrote on behalf of constituents, nevertheless, What it does do is often make civil servants look for a second time at a case. And in perhaps almost half of cases, I was Very struck that we were able to get things done by making the civil servant look at 2nd time at some injustice that had been done to a constituent. That injustice was righted, but it did make me wonder, is this a sensible way of proceeding? Because effectively, the people who are lucky enough to get in to see the MP in the surgery have a 5050 Chance of having a case turned around.\n\nThose that don't get to see the MP and are following the normal process, the normal procedures don't. So I had a lot of questions about whether this is a sensible way to run a country.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I I thought one of the interesting parts of our conversation with the 2 Andys, Andy Burnham and Andy Street, the mayors of, Manchester and the West Midlands was when Andy Street was saying that he thought, actually, it was it was harder to be the mayor with a government of the same party. And I wonder sometimes whether for an MP, is it easier or harder if you're fighting on behalf of a constituent. Because, you know, you might know the minister, but the minister, frankly, isn't gonna give, you know, too much attention to an individual constituency complain. Whereas an opposition MP might be able to generate all sorts of bad publicity for the ministry if they don't.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it also depends whether there's a big majority. I mean, one of the problems is if there's a very Slim majority. You've lost your majority in parliament, then MPs can really exercise often very unfair power. Here's a question I liked, and I'm gonna have a go and then give to you. Adam Serafin, does Rory think that sortition choosing MPs by random lottery from a pool of volunteers is a vile Option from Modern Robotics.\n\nI'm very attracted by sortition because it's the basis obviously of juries, that's how juries are selected, and citizens' assemblies. And it's how ancient Athens worked. People were selected by by random lottery. I wouldn't necessarily do it even from a pool of volunteers. I'd I'm very interested in what happens if you do it from the whole public.\n\nNow I'm not sure I've fully thought that through, but I do think there's something really about the idea of a genuinely representative sample of people and being more honest about the fact that In a way, what MPs are there to do might be to represent the diversity in our society rather than particular forms of expertise, and it will take the power away from the parties, which I'd like.\n\nSpeaker 0: Maybe you were singing the praises of the New Zealand PR system. Although, we did have a few Kiwis hitting back at that. But Maybe that is the only way that it would work is if you had constituency MPs, but it you also had a different sort of MP who had a different sort of role, which was not basically, which was almost like a sort of a permanent citizens' assembly or a permanent, jury on the parliament. But I I don't think it's as barmy an idea as as some people do. When we were in Bath, by the way, on the way to the, the forum, I went to do a talk in a in a primary school.\n\nAnd one of the children there said to me asked me if I was in favor of keeping the voting age at 18, or would I bring it down? And I said, yeah. I would bring it down. I'd bring it down to 16. And this child in front of me, arm shot straight up and said, why not 5?\n\nAnd I said I said, well, I said, no. Well, you tell me why you think it should be 5, and she said because, Well, listen to how we've been talking to you. We think about these things a lot more than grown ups do. It's quite it's quite a good, It was a fantastic I've got to say, it was a it was a primary school in Jacob Rees Mogg territory, and the kids I I was there for hours. The kids were just nonstop sort of questioning, but and they knew a lot about climate change, and they were very, very worried about it.\n\nAnd We also had a little vote. I didn't even say what I thought about Brexit, Rory. Maybe some of their parents have told me, but we had a little vote on whether we should go back in the European Union, 100% in favor. So very sensible children, I'd say.\n\nSpeaker 1: So question for you, how would Tony Blair's Labour cope now? Patrick Chapman, if Tony Blair's label was coming to power post this conservative party, would they be successful in implementing change? They inherited a decent economy in 97, but it won't be the case now.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yep. That's a very, very good question. I think look. It's it's true. Look.\n\nKeir Starmer, if he becomes prime minister, he's not coming into a a very benign economic, landscape. But that's why some of the things that you talked about in your answer on the main podcast about, you know, how labor should project themselves at the next election, about developing an industrial strategy, about having a different sort of commitment to the regions and so forth. It's not all about money in the first stage, is Howard put it. And I think that's what we did. And don't forget, for the 1st 2 years, we did stick to Tory tax spend limits and and and then started to signal the changes, and they made the changes.\n\nSo I think you can do a lot. I think and I and I so I think Tony would have come in and and wanted to take on some of the big challenges that we have now. I think he probably would make a lot more of science and technology and AI. I think probably would want to rebuild relations with the European Union. But I was very pleased that even though I'm still raging about Brexit and still don't think Labour have called out the Brexit disaster nearly enough, I did since this week, the first signals of of Keir Star, where he did an interview in the Financial Times where he said, you know, when when it comes to renegotiating the trading cooperation agreement, we're going to have to something far better than we've got.\n\nSo there's an understanding, at least, that this thing's got to be fixed. My final question, We haven't talked about films for a while. Joe says, what films have really touched you both, and what are your favorite films? Oh. Of all the films I've seen recently, I think the one that Touched me the most was belt Kenneth Branagh's Belfast.\n\nWe're about 3 quarters of the way through the once upon a time in Northern Ireland. I do think Northern Ireland lends itself to amazing human drama, whether documentary or or a a feature film. But I thought I thought Kenneth Branagh's Film captured something incredibly touching about what it's like to be a child growing up surrounded by these these hatreds, and I thought it was Brilliant.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think the film that really touched me, which maybe not everybody's seen, is a film called Call Me by Your Name, which is a 2017 Love Story set in Italy with Timothee Chalamet?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Really, really beautiful movie, set in, I guess, the early Early 19 eighties in Northern Italy, but it it's essentially about a young boy falling in love with a a slightly older man, and I think just beautifully paced, beautifully acted. On literature also, I cannot resist saying thank you to you for all your support on the on the sales of book because We've made it number 1, nonfiction hardback, Politics on the Edge. Sold 44,592 copies across all editions in the 1st week. So thank you very much for the support.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, there you go. Well done. No. That's a that's a big hit. That's a big hit.\n\nThat's, that that beats my 1st week, I think. So what what what are you reading? We know what you've written. What are you reading?\n\nSpeaker 1: Tom Holland, who does the rest is history podcast and very kind he did in November Meet the Barber Con, has got me on to these McCarran spy books. Which of\n\nSpeaker 0: you have? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: Have you tried them?\n\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely brilliant. I get slagged off for mentioning the lie because it leads to people turning up. But Those of us who are 365, day a year people, there is a sort of camaraderie, and there's quite a lot of sort of book sending around. So, Martin Martin Martin. There are 2 Martins, but Martin knows which Martin this is.\n\nThis is what the one we call Martin Highgate Cemetery because he does guide he does guided tours if I get cemetery. He got me on to the Mick Heron novels, and they are very, very good.\n\nSpeaker 1: Let me just quickly for people who've not not read them. They're they're set in Slough House, and it's kind of it turns being a spy into living in a sort of grimy sort of version of a dishevelled Kind of regional, I don't know, Social Security Agency.\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm gonna give another plug to the book I mentioned yesterday, Le Piedge. And I'm gonna do it in the context of I'm sure there are lots of people in publishing listen to our podcast. Honestly, an English publisher needs to get a hold of it. It's a very, very good book. You don't understand Putin and what's happened in Ukraine until you really fully understand what he did with Nord Stream.\n\nSo I'm reading that, and I'm also reading, a a German novel by a guy another another book by a guy called Alex Kapusz, who's not German, actually. I think he's Swiss, but, he writes in German.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Well, thank you, Alastair, very much. See you soon.\n\nSpeaker 0: Bye bye.",
