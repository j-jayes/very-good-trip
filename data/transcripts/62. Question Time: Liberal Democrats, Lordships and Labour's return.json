So welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And a reminder, we've got a live date in the diary to tell you about on stage performing the rest of his politics live. London Palladium, Wednesday, March 22. They go in general sale on Friday, and we will tweet the link in the morning. And now let's get on with some questions. Yeah. So, well, first question I wanna start with is, Obviously, I talk a lot about Max Miller, the cheeky chappy, because he played at the Winter Gardens and played at Palladium. And and the question is, Question question from Joe is, what what what's the best Max Miller joke? So I'm gonna give you a Max Miller joke. So for those of you who don't know, Max Miller, great twenties musical comedian. And, so he he goes up on stage. He says, he says, I I I I was in Egypt recently, and and I I was I was hoping home and to get married. And I said to the pharaoh, mister pharaoh, will you will you give me give me your daughter in marriage? And he said yes, certainly, certainly I will, Max, certainly I will. I'll I'll give you 2 acres and a cow. Haven't seen The 2 Acres yet. There we are. That's the joke. Anyway, the only thing that's Oh my god. Oh my god. The the only anything that's interesting about that joke is that it's the Lloyd George joke because Lloyd George believes that the fundamental way to set someone up economically was 2 acres and a cow. And a lot of what we do in Africa at the moment is actually about helping people get a cow. Makes a huge difference. In fact, Robert Maxwell, your old boss, Said that when he was growing up in Ruthenia in the Carpathian mountains, the greatest ambition that he'd had as a young man was to get a cow. That's how you mate yourself in a village. Yeah. Alright. Nothing to do. Over to you for a bit more. I think that was I'm absolutely convinced that Max Muller will have got a lot of laughs out of that joke, Rory, but I I love the way you tried to turn it into a serious Point to the end. I'm gonna tell you to something more serious. Emma Stacey, I'd like to know your thoughts on nurses being balloted to strike, Whether you think we can get the support of the public, and will they understand it's not just about pay, but standards of care given due to shortage in recruitment. Vincent Pettervelle, As a nurse, I have voted for industrial action this week. I'd love to know both of your thoughts on this. If we, as a union, vote for strike action, thank you for as always. Well, let I mean, well, can let let me start from my sort of funny ex Tory background and say firstly that we should have huge sympathy for the fact that Nurses are incredibly overworked, often very underpaid, and of course it's got much much worse since Brexit because All the immigration regulations about bringing in nurses from other countries haven't kept up with the demand, so we're up hundreds of thousands of people short. And again, it'll come hundreds of thousands more people short over the coming years. So there is a huge problem, but of course, And this isn't really a good answer to nurses, but it's worth thinking in terms of our programme, our podcast, that this is just the thin end of the wedge. The entire public sector is Trained and stretched and is facing 10% rises in inflation, and that's actually often underestimating it. If you If you think about going to the supermarkets at the moment, you'll find that many basic goods have jumped much more than 10% in the last few months. You know, people have, you know, if you're buying Cheese at the moment, you'll find it's often up 30, 40%. That's true for a lot of other staple products. You're taking a long time not to answer the question here, Aure. Well, I suppose what I'm saying is I think I've got a lot of sympathy, but we should also be aware that there's gonna be a lot more strike action by many, many more people, And we're gonna find ourselves, I fear, going back to something that's gonna feel more like the 19 seventies. There's gonna be a lot of striking going on. There's gonna be a lot of inflation going on, And it doesn't matter which government comes in, conservative or Labour. They're gonna be really struggling to control prices, wages, and balance the budget. If you were a nurse, would you Yeah. If I was a nurse if I was a nurse, I'd probably go on strike. If I was the government, I'd be completely terrified about what that means, and And I'd be worried even if I was the labor minister. Well, I I think also there's a consequence here of previous actions. I felt that the even as far back as the coalition government, I felt there was a strategy that was essentially all about not criticizing, but but this constant sort of demanding of public sector workers to do more, A lot of criticism of what they did, and I think that was cranked up under Johnson. Then we had those sort of, you know, clap for carers and don't we love the NHS, And with they were the the angels and all that stuff that was sort of pumped out there. And then they do, I think, get a bit of a kick in the teeth. And honestly, my neighbor's a nurse. And, you know, you talk to people who work in the whole at the moment. They say it really is incredibly pressured, very, very difficult, and they feel all they get is abuse from the government. So I completely understand both Emma and Vincent. And if only we had a government that actually addressed their concerns rather than sought to exploit them, I think that would be better. But I I'm I'm with you, but Addressing concerns is gonna turn out to probably be a much more difficult poison thing for Labour when they take over than than we're acknowledging, just saying that quickly. Okay. Now listen. We talked briefly yesterday about Ukraine. There's a question here from PEOW. To what extent is a possible return of the Republicans to power In 2 years in the states, a factoring Ukraine war. Surely, if the war is still going at that point and they win the election, Ukraine have an enormous problem. Might Russia start to bank on this? Well, at the moment, there's pretty strong bipartisan support for the Ukraine war. That that's one of the things that Biden's doing, which there isn't much republican opposition to. The skepticism It's only coming from the far Trump wing of the party. So the question is, if Trump wins, yes, there is a problem. I think Trump is Has a very, very odd relationship with Putin, and you will have seen interviews with general Flynn, who was his very controversial national security adviser. God, he was awful. Did you see that interview where he was basically attacking Zelensky? Yeah. Yeah. So I I think that that there is a very worrying fringe that people will be concerned about. But at the moment, it looks The leading candidate really at the moment is is DeSantis. And I don't know how much the UK media have been covering DeSantis, but Ron DeSantis Nao seems to be ahead of Trump on a lot of the indicators. He's, part of this strange American phenomenon of these kind of people who I think he went to Yale University, But was also in the United States Navy, but somehow uses this quite establishment background to be very, very anti establishment. He just flew a planeload of Mexican immigrants To Martha's Vineyard, which is the kinda super wealthy retreat of the liberal elite, to try to make a point because he's a Florida politician that The Liberal elite in the United States doesn't really understand immigration because it's not really happening to them in the same way. But, anyway, I don't think DeSantis's views on Russia and Ukraine are actually that, are as concerning as Trump's. Okay. Okay. Katie Parker. So Ella Braverman wants to recategorize cannabis as a class a drug. This would have knock on effects for our already overcrowded courts and prisons, not just overcrowded courts, but courts he can barely bit get a case through, Clogging them up even more, is Brabham's proposal just nationalist populist madness? What do you think? Yes. Yes. Well, I mean, cannabis is a class a drug. It's like and, also, you know, we were we were talking yesterday about what, What can we do to kind of I actually think the legalization of cannabis and the the marketization of cannabis, which is happening in a lot of Different parts of the United States, and I think Joe Biden has moved on this fairly recently as well. You could actually see it as a bit of a a bit of a money spinner, but I'm afraid Braverman really is. There was a wonderful, oh, what does this say? Was it Private Eye? It was a couple of a headshot of Suella Brahmman and Priti Patel. And Suella Brahmman's speech bubble says, how do you think I'm doing? And Priti Patel says, I think you could probably be a bit more compassionate. I think what Priti Patel is seen as more compassionate than her successor, that we're in we're in real trouble. Right. Question from you. Go on. So, Perry, why do XMP struggle? Rory made a comment in passing last week that XMPs come and find it very difficult to find employment after leaving parliament. Can you expand on this? I imagined it to be the opposite As many seem to fall into comfy roles in the private sector that probably pay a lot more. Now oddly, that that just isn't true, and I I don't know whether you want to talk about labor MPs who are friends of yours and on what's happened. But the truth is that the old days may have been true in the 19 sixties 19 seventies where MPs could go into private sector jobs comfortably after they left have have left. Couple of reasons. One of them is that we used to have a lot of nationalized industries in Britain, which were basically controlled by the government, so it was very easy for the government to put ex MPs onto the boards of Nationalized Industries. That's all gone. But also, the reputation of MPs is so low that people don't think there's any status on having on their board Somebody who's been a member of parliament. Increasingly, they're looking for if you're a bank or something, looking for someone on your board, you're looking for somebody who knows something about the subject area. Mhmm. And MPs are not really qualified. I mean, increasingly, they're professional politicians. They many, many of them now have started as counselors. They've started as party activists. They've done almost nothing else in their lives than politics for 20 or 30 years. And unless they're lucky enough to have a professional qualification as an accountant or a lawyer or something like that, it's It's very, very difficult for them to get a job. So, I I mean, do you have you reflect on this? I mean, of you Labour MPs who've left? I I look. I I think if you are The top level. If you look at how much Theresa May gets paid for you know, Theresa May was not the greatest author, but she's in this sort of top league of Big money public speaking sector. I'm sure David Cameron's making lots of money in different ways. Tony Blair makes lots of money. John Major makes lots of money. I think at that level Yeah. That's prime minister. I mean, prime minister's You see people and I agree. You see people like George Osborne is making a fortune. Philip Hammond is making a fortune. But I think most MPs I think you're right. I think they struggle. I think they struggle financially. I think they struggle psychologically. You get good pensions, you guys, don't you? Former MPs get good pensions. Yep. Depends it depends how long you're in the House of Commons, though. And the remember, the pension I don't wanna defend MPs particularly, but the pension, The it's an unusual job because the salary you enter on is the same as the salary that you would have if you'd been there 50 years. It's there's no seniority involved in the job, because every MP is equal, so they all get the same backbench salary, A pension contribution's come off that. It's a decent salary. It's more than most people in Britain get, but it's considerably less than you would get as a GP or as a head teacher of a large school, So becoming an MP is definitely not not a way to get wealthy. And No. I remember Eric Heffer Eric Heffer, the Labour MP, always used to say there's there's nothing more x than an SNP. Yeah. Well, I I I I I talked to somebody who was my predecessor in the government department who was actually looking at Stacking shells at Tesco's after he left. I mean, it's it's, that's that's obviously very extreme. I mean, that's not usually what happens. Usually what happens is they end up in an even more humiliating world, often which is Getting into public affairs. So you get paid not a great deal of money to try to promote some private sector company, and then you get into difficulty because you're Accused of lobbying. You're trying to call up your ex colleagues. It's very embarrassing. You sit in the Portcollus, which is the tea rooms, a kind of mot the more modern tea room in the House of Commons, And you see this slightly depressing scene of your former colleagues coming in table to table, trying to hand out brochures, Saying, can I just get 10 minutes of your time? And it's it's it's a bit sad. Yep. A bit sad. Yeah. Now, Jude Carrier, I read today about the tax Breaks being offered to people to set up in Freeport. So I'm very worried about these and what they mean in terms of employment, environmental, and planning protections that Freeport seem to evade. How worried should we be? Well, Well, I think we should be very worried, and we've talked a lot about this in relation to the whole sovereign individual agenda, low tax, no regulation, piss on the workers kind of thing. And the FTA, the weekend, had a story that even quasi Kuateng has started to get worried. I don't know if you saw this, Rory. Basically said that the LISTRAS has overruled Kuateng, who wanted to put a limit on the number of applications for low tax investment zones. And I guess the the worry, if you're the government and particularly if you're the treasury, is that you risk losing 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 of pounds in in lost taxes, and she's really she's she's saying that we shouldn't have any limit. Well, is she saying the whole country should become an investment zone? It's completely catastrophic. So if you set up one of these zones. You can get a 100% relief on your, machinery investment. You get a 100% relief for the 1st year on your business Rates. You get a massive holiday on National Insurance. So what is so worrying for me, again, from a sort of 1 nation Physically conservative background is that this is potentially a blank cheque which could cost the government £40,000,000,000 a year In the worst case scenario, if you end up with too many of these things opening everywhere, and generally, what the treasury has always argued and would probably continue to argue today is that It just displaces activity from elsewhere. It doesn't help the overall economy. In most cases, it simply moves investments that would be going into the other parts of the country somewhere else, but it doesn't bring new investment time. Are the investment zones part of the anti growth coalition? I the investment zones, sadly, that's a nice question, and I can see where you're coming from there, I think the awful thing is that, actually, it's what worries me more about the whole stuff, which is it's the growth at any cost, But no revenue from the government coalition, and that's what's that's why why I as a more you know, conservatism used to be about prudence and restraint when it came to this stuff. And what worries me is I if I was I we've talked about this in the past, but Keir Starmer needs to turn it around and say, You know, growth at any cost is a very disturbing thing. Here here's a question that I got, maybe quickly on this. Ian Birdsall, please can you explain what a 1 nation conservative is? It's a phrase I just don't understand, and what are you if you're not a 1 nation conservative? Do Do you want me to have a little quick look at that? Well, before you do, I remember when we talked about Bill Clinton up in Blackpool, and one one of his, favorite piece of advice, he he once So just remember when they talk about compassionate conservatism, the only word that counts in that is conservatism. So Explain explain 1 nation. The the 1 nation tradition began with Benjamin Disraeli back in 19th century, and it's essentially about an argument about, Yep. Social solidarity about not having a society that's divided between the very rich and the poor, and it became under missus Thatcher a Slogan for people that you know, I'm one of them. Right? So we would have called ourselves moderate or center center right politicians. And she called you wet? And she called us wet. So, yeah, 1 nation, Tories are wet. That's the traditional definition. And the other side of it The dry right wing conservatives who, in the case of this trust, tend to this very libertarian view, which is, Which is the only thing that matters is economics and growth. Just before we go to the break, little little poem, little 18th century poem for you here. Actually, it's Yates on on the 18th century. What he would have said about Liz Truss is she's not really a Tory, definitely not a 1 nation conservative. He's what he would have called A Whig. And he says about these great 18th century conservative thinkers like Burke, Berkeley, Goldsmith, he said, All hated wiggory, that levelling, rancorous, rational sort of mind that never looked out of the eye of a saint Or out of a drunkard's eye, all's wiggery now, and we old men are massed against the world. Nice. So we stand for the saints and the drunkards in the 1 nation tradition. Let's go to a break. Right. Welcome back To the rest of politics, question time with me, Alastair Campbell. Me, Rory Stewart. And, Rory, are you gonna tell me that you that Poem just came out of your memory bank as opposed to you're sitting at a laptop with access to every piece of information under the sun. Genuinely, genuinely, promise, promise, promise, promise, promise came out of my memory. Oh, well, excellent. Excellent. Just shows that and that was learnt at the school that The audience in Blackpool said I should bang on about more. We had a vote, didn't we? I think I I learned it actually in Indonesia after I got this school. Here's relevance to Lib Dems. Good question I saw from a guy called Rob Blackburn. As someone highly disillusioned by the collapse of the moderate, sensible conservative party, but not fully confident in the policies and ability of the Labour Party. I find myself wondering where the Lib Dems are in all of this chaos And why they aren't cutting through more? What are your thoughts on this? What do they need to do to find their voice? And I think that is an important question because I think the collapse of moderate sensible conservative party is clear, But I do think that there are he he put his finger on some of the things that people will worry about with Labour, which is, are they fully confident in their fully Policy is fully confident in their ability. And where are the Lib Dems? Where are the Lib Dems, Alastair? What's happened to them? Well, they they, of course, had the misfortune of having to Cancel their conference, didn't they, because of the the queen's death? So I suppose that would have given them a bit of national public attention. They've suffered from 2 things that have happened in quick succession. 1, the coalition. I I think Nick Clegg was right to take the Lib Dems into coalition. I think if you're fighting An election you want government, you go into when you get the chance, but that definitely damaged their brand and their electoral standing thereafter there because of the whole austerity thing and tuition fees and everything else. And then the second thing that happened is that after the last election, you've got to remember that the the coverage that is Particularly across the the national channel, the the big national channels, which then sort of feed down into the rest of the media ecosystem, is dependent upon how many Seats you have in parliament. So even something like question time. I mean, people will probably notice that Ian Blackford is called far more regularly At question time, then, Ed David, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. So these things have had an impact. But then added to that, I think they've made a Stake in, echoing Labour's line on Brexit and sort of basically making a gigantic elephant in the room that nobody talks about. They don't have a distinctive economic message. They don't have a distinctive social policy message. They they will probably say, oh, we have lots of policies. It's just people don't know about them. Well, I'm sorry. In the modern world, that's just tough. You've got to make sure that people do know about them. Did you work with them closely? We I know you were very strongly, obviously, on the remain second referendum side, which the Dems were on in those days. Did you did you have a lot to do with the Lib Dems in those days when you were thrown out of labor? Did you see much more of them then? Not really. I mean, they I voted Lib Dems in in the European elections. But that was about trying to get the Labour Party to change its position, which eventually it did. And the Lib Dems were terribly excited and thought that I was going to become a LibDEM, which, a shum, I never was. And, look, I had a lot I had a lot to do with them, but also had lots to do with, you know, pro Remain Tories during the People's Vote campaign. But I think they are in a bit of a tricky position. But, also, I wouldn't rule out that they become very, very significant in this next election because there are parts of the country where for Labour to win, they need the Lib Dems to do pretty well. I mean, that I was down in the Westcountry recently, and, you know, down there, There are some seats that Labour can take. There are an awful lot of seats that are gonna have to be taken by the Lib Dems. And when we were talking yesterday about the polling being so bad For the Tories, don't forget that that the SNP is still polling well in Scotland. So that suggests actually that because the Scots are taking into account in the national polls. That suggests Labour are doing even better in England than the polls might indicate. But the Lib Dems are going to have to do well in certain parts of the country if the Tories are gonna get be got rid of. And I think a big driver there's always a central question at any general election. There's usually 1 negative or 1 positive. And then the negative question is, we've gotta get rid of the tories or, you know, can we really afford another term of the tories? And then more positively, you know, has Labour got the positive agenda to get over the line? It's such a it's such a mystery, isn't it? Because given there are so many people, to some extent, you and me, but definitely many, many people who listen to this podcast who feel that they are in the center of British politics and are a bit suspicious of left and right. And and given that actually for many years, the Public opinion was like a kind of bell jar with the votes in the centre and not many votes on either side. It's extraordinary that the Lib Dems have performed historically So badly that the Liberal Party died in England in the- famously in the early twenties, and that it's never really managed to come back in a 100 years, and I I it's it's it's a bit mysterious. When I was running to be London mayor's independent, somebody suggested that I could reach out to the Lib Dems and see if I could become their candidate, And the polling suggested that my vote share would have collapsed from something like 13, 15% Down to 5% if I become the Lib Dem candidate that actually being an independent was a stronger brand than being a Lib Dem In London, sunny then, 2020. I mean, I think the look. We're back to the we've talked about this many, many times, the strength of the 2 parties. Both the main parties strong. Somebody once said to me not long ago of of Labour, the problem with Labour is it's too weak to win and too strong to die. Now, Now, actually, I think at the moment, Labour is in a pretty good position to win. But the Lib Dems, I think the peak, the modern peak, was the coalition years, And they've paid a price for that. Anthony Bohan. Yep. It sounds like Paul Daker and Nadine Dorries will soon be joining the likes of Baroness Fox of Buckley And lord Lebedeff of Hampton, Siberia, isn't it time to abolish or reform the house of lords? Well, I'm a big reform person. I would like to see a house of Lords. None of the politicians would like it, but I'd like to see it composed of people more like crossbenchers. I I was always very, very impressed by the senior judges, diplomats, academics, people like the Amazing. Martin Rees, the, Astronomer Royal in the House of Lords, the quality of their debates was often much, much higher because these guys Knew an incredible amount. They'd had very long careers. They had an enormous amount of information. So if you want to see a debate on foreign policy, the House of Lords had a much Higher quality of debate in the House of Commons. On military staff, it's obviously got a lot of generals and defense experts in it, but what we have to do, I'm afraid, is get rid of the donors and the politicians. Yeah. But Rory, the problem with it it is part of the legislative process. So what you're describing is a kind of expert debating chamber, which may have a place in our politics, but I think reform has got to go way further than that. Although, I always had this this dream that, In in a sense, we'd have very we'd have a the House of Commons is the center of our kind of democratic debate. We'd have really powerful regional assemblies, And there'd be some kind of link into that. And then we'd also have the European Parliament. We're we're out of that now, so there's no point thinking of that for the time being. Look. I've I've actually written my column for the New European about this this week, pegged to the the new names that have come forward, which I mean, the idea of Paul Daker. I mean, Honestly, Paul Daker, he's he's done so much damage to our political debate. He's nothing but an establishment hack who pretends to be an anti establishment. And I felt sort of strangely pleased when I heard that he was definitely going to go there because I think it so debases the whole thing. It it shows that Johnson has learned nothing. It shows Truss has learned nothing. And then, of course, we're gonna get his resignation on us as well, which are going to be truly horrific. So I'm hoping this is just another nail in the coffin of the House of Lords. One of the things you will have read, is that he's also proposing to do something very unusual, which is in his resignation honors, push MPs who are currently in the House of Commons into the House of Lords, which would trigger a by election. You'd end up with 7 by elections, which would be Trust doesn't want that. Catastrophic for trust. The the reason I'm very strongly against an elected house of lords is that we would end up In the US problem of the standoff between Congress and Senate, in in a way, what's good about the House of Lords is it doesn't have democratic legitimacy, See, so all it can do is delay legislation. But if you had 2 elected chambers, the people in the upper house would begin to say, well, we're elected just like the lower house. We have every right To block legislation, we have just as much democratic legitimacy as they do, and we would then find ourselves in gridlock. So I would much rather Go on the crossbench model, have people who are experts, who represent different professions, lean into diversity in the House of Lords, And make it a really impressive debating chamber, but not have it elected because I think elected would be gridlock. Here's one, Rory. Similar theme. Jay Hearn, hello from North Sydney. I love Sydney. Will the Liberal Democrats and the Greens increase their seats in the next election? More than 30% of Australian voters did not vote for a major party in 2021. Communities are now running independents in North South Wales and Victoria lower houses and hope to hold the balance of power. So this is our old friend, the Teals, isn't it? But I don't think that's gonna happen here. It does. Well, the problem is they've got a single transferable vote system, haven't they, which allows them to do, which really helps an independent. I think there's a huge market for it. I think there's an enormous market for TEALS, which is fiscally conservative, Environmentally progressive candidates the center, and I think you could imagine having a really strong, attractive party doing that, but I can't quite see the La Dembs being that party. Adam Blackburn, would right wing media back Labour again? So the recent polling, are we likely to see the right wing aligned media ever move to Supporting Labour, or have things changed since new Labour and these publications are too far down the rabbit hole to want to realign? Would Murdoch want to back a horse Bound to lose, though? Don't know. Don't know. Don't really care that much. Oh, you do care, Alice? You're always saying the right wing media is The key to the thing, aren't you? No. I've never said it's the key. I think it's the key to the framing of the debate, and that's why I rail at the broadcasters from time to time. No. Look. I'd rather because all of them took politics seriously, treated all the parties reasonably fairly, and had at least some separation of news and comment. That's gone. It's Just That's not gonna happen, and and that's not true of the Mirror of the Guardian either. No. I agree. I agree. I think will they shift? I I don't know. A lot depends on how they I mean, you look at the express literally every day. It's just like a Truss fanzine. It's gone from being a Johnson fanzine to being a Truss fanzine. The Mail sort of, you know, is trying to sort of face a little bit both ways. I haven't really seen much of The Sun recently. I noticed the Sunday times have become much more critical. So I suppose it's not impossible, but I think at this stage, it's unlikely. I think Murdoch, who's a terrifying figure in so many ways, but I think he likes the winner. And if he concludes that this trust is incompetent and isn't gonna win. I think it's very likely that he'll change. Mhmm. But don't forget as well, he's he's, you know, he's he's how can I put this gently? He's he's getting on. Karl Marx. I don't think he's the yeah. I don't think he's the Karl Marx because I I saw his grave recently when I went up to see I really don't. Philip Gouldsgrave and my friend John Merritt. This This one is a question directly to me and directly to you. Alastair, did you vote for Labor under Jeremy Corbyn? Yes. I did. And would you expect Corbyn supporters to still vote Labor under Keir Summer? Yes. I would. Rory Stewart, who will you vote for in the next election? Cor blimey. It's a difficult one, isn't it? Really difficult one. I would find it impossible to vote, I'm afraid at the moment for Liz Truss' conservative party. I'm just horrified by the direction. It's not what I ever believed in. The thing for me which makes it difficult, and I think for Some of my colleagues who are still in parliament is that, obviously, we have been aware for a dozen years or more, or maybe many of us, 20 years, that being a conservative It is very, very unpopular that many people think that we are a very, very nasty party, that we're actually out there deliberately damaged people, and we've been trying to defend ourselves and say, no. That isn't what we're about. We are a party that believes In prudence at home, restraint to board, love of tradition, evolution not revolution, pragmatism, local communities. And now we have this trust, and this trust is like the worst possible vision. It it feels to me, as I imagine Jeremy Corbyn will have felt To moderate Labour voters that Corbyn sort of revealed aside of far left Labour socialism that many moderate Labour MPs had Been trying to deny and say we're not a party run by this conflict. So Liz Truss is the kind of Jeremy Corbyn of our party? Right. So you but you haven't answered the question. You said you'd find it hard to vote for Liz Truss. Well, so I I wouldn't I wouldn't vote for this, and I'm and I'm surprised you were prepared to vote for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. I'm actually quite slightly shocked by that. Well, I ventured Labour because I thought that was the only way to get rid of the Tories, and I'd I I I I I you thought Jeremy Corbyn would have been better than Theresa May? Theresa May wasn't standing. It was Boris Johnson. Well, how did she vote in 2017 when she was I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. Yeah. I've voted I've voted for Jeremy then. But To be honest, I think I think one of the reasons Theresa May got a majority is people didn't actually think Jeremy Corbyn could win. And I think one of the reasons that Boris Johnson won as As well as he did, it was because people by then thought that Jeremy Corbyn might win. But I wanted to get a kind of, you know, progressive alliance, I guess, is what I was after. But I think now, I do think that a combination and And even this coalition against growth, whatever it was she came up with, they're trying to get this concept into the public mind that a coalition will be terrible, than if it's sort of Keir Starmer and Nicola Sturgeon or Keir Starmer and and Ed Davey. But, actually, one of the upsides of Ed Davey is I don't think people see him as as threatening in a way that maybe they did with Joe Swinson. I hope you vote Labor, Roy, but I also hope that if it's in a seat that the Liberal Democrats can win and Labor can't, that you'd maybe vote tactically. Gabriela, WikiLeaks. You haven't answered the question. You haven't answered the question. No. I don't I I'm definitely not gonna vote for Liz Truss' conservative party, but I'll have to work out what I do when I get into that. And and have you not yet decided? I have not yet decided, no. I've not yet decided. Not yet decided. Okay. Here's here's here's a question. How do we build political community? EE Fry. Your Blackpool show gave me a sense of political community I'd not felt in an extremely long time. I think that was because the Max Miller jokes that we told are music hall jokes. I felt safe for the first time in ages. How do we build on that? How do we create a community for the disenfranchised, politically homeless citizens of nowhere? What Do I do now? There we are. So what does EE Fry do now? Well, EE Fry, what do you do now? First of all, you you wait excitedly for my next book, which is going to be called, what can I do? And then I think there'll be lots of the answers in there. I'm glad that E. E. Fry felt that about our gathering. I think it's been a general relation in the whole. Labour would have won. But I think there were Lib Dems in there. I think there were Greens in there. I think there were Tories. I think there were young people who were too young to vote. And I think thinking about it in the concept of the political community, I think we do have to win this idea That it's possible to have serious, intelligent, informed debate that we don't always have to agree with every Dot and comma of everything that the other person is saying, but we can still kind of get along. And I think the other thing we have to do, we have to keep calling out The stuff that we disagree with and the stuff that we don't like and the responsibility to call it out is even greater when the people who are doing the worst things are the people in power. And then I'd say to EE Fry, join a party. Whatever your politics are, join a party. Join campaigns, be active, stay active, get active, and just don't give up hope. Very good. Okay. Now final one. I think we're coming up towards the end here. At from Escobar, I came all the way from Warsaw to see you. So he came from Warsaw to Blackpool. That's quite the journey, particularly with the train strikes on. You've not mentioned Poland much in your podcast. What is your take on Poland's crazy right wing government? They're crazy. Yep. Well, just just to remind people, so Law and Justice party, PIC fights European Union, taking a very hard line approach to women's rights. It's tried to muzzle independent media, done strange stuff for the courts. So it's very much a nativist populist government, but it's one that, of course, has caused a lot of confusion. I mean, it's disintegrating European democratic values, But, of course, the war in Ukraine has given us an opportunity to project itself as the great champion of European solidarity in defense of Ukraine and democratic values. Well, first of all, I'm I think we should thank him. If he if he genuinely came to Blackpool just to see us, I I feel rather bad because when you did at one point ask people how far they'd come, nobody shouted out Warsaw. I think Chichester was the furthest away that I heard. So he came from Warsaw. I I sort of feel bad that we didn't give him lots of love and special attention. We should've done. We should've done. We should've got him backstage and have a look around and stuff. But, look, I I think there's there are 2 reasons, I think, why Poland and its government doesn't get quite the opprobrium that others do. One is that because, actually, there most people these days know polls. There are a lot of polls. A lot have gone back, but we you know, Poles have become a pretty big part of British life, and and I think, actually, that's maybe now people get their assessment of Poland through the fact that we know more Polish people, And they seem quite nice, and they're very hardworking, etcetera, etcetera. But the second thing is that Orban takes most of the heat on the whole sort of busy grad stuff, And I think that Poland stays a little bit under the radar. And your final point about Ukraine, I think, is incredibly important. They have They have shown a very different side to themselves in relation to Ukraine. And because Ukraine has been so defining in in recent months, that has maybe, taking the heat off them as well. But I mean, the change is extraordinary, isn't it? Because they were flirting, really, with kinda right wing nativist populism and the Authoritarian regimes, and then they flipped around. And they went from you remember they were when there was this problem in Belarus, there were water cannons and truncheons, The polls driving back Belarusian migrants to the border suddenly flipped to taking 1 a half 1000000 Ukrainians almost overnight into Poland. So it's it's been a very interesting sort of reshaping, and it it it's it's a sign that you can be a strong part of European Political values, oddly, while not signing up to the full democratic agenda. Anyway, I think it's something we should explore more. Maybe we should, Well, maybe we should do a podcast in in Poland someday. Yeah. Absolutely. Go to Poland. Absolutely. We should get a train. We should get a train. Because you spend too much time on airplanes, Rory, and you and you would, I noticed your defense of your flying. At least I admitted I felt guilty about it. I felt your defense didn't go down well with the audience. Well, I sort of thought it was a bit bit rich when I, For the sake of the audience, I had just completely shattered myself flying all the way from Jordan to Blackpool and then Blackpool to Marrakesh to be attacked for getting on a plane. I thought, Screw you. I'll do it on I'll do it on video conferencing next time. Here's here's an invitation to get on another very long flight. Somebody with a wonderful name of Fernanda Diaz. I'm a dual British Argentine citizen living in Argentina since last year. I want to extend a running invitation to you both to come and visit because Rory Welch remarked he knew very little about Latin America. So, Fernanda, I don't know who you are. I don't know what you do, But thank you for the invitation, and it sounds very, very well. And I think we'll be traveling by boat as part of your as part of Alice's new carbon retention. Oh, we could swim. We could swim Has you bottled out of the black pool swim? Yeah. I I I would love to hear about your black pool swim, Elsa. How did it go? Well, because you bottled out And because the tide was I didn't even speak Because the tide was so far out Yeah. Derry me. This is desperate. Decided to leave early And get home, but I went to the line. It's the one bit I I know I never get to give you comms advice because you're a much more able comms person to me, but my small bit of comms advice is Before you accuse somebody else of bottling out of a swim, check you've done the swim yourself. Alright, guys. On that, farewell. All the best.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: So welcome to the rest of this politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell. And a reminder, we've got a live date in the diary to tell you about on stage performing the rest of his politics live. London Palladium, Wednesday, March 22. They go in general sale on Friday, and we will tweet the link in the morning. And now let's get on with some questions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So, well, first question I wanna start with is, Obviously, I talk a lot about Max Miller, the cheeky chappy, because he played at the Winter Gardens and played at Palladium. And and the question is, Question question from Joe is, what what what's the best Max Miller joke? So I'm gonna give you a Max Miller joke. So for those of you who don't know, Max Miller, great twenties musical comedian.\n\nAnd, so he he goes up on stage. He says, he says, I I I I was in Egypt recently, and and I I was I was hoping home and to get married. And I said to the pharaoh, mister pharaoh, will you will you give me give me your daughter in marriage? And he said yes, certainly, certainly I will, Max, certainly I will. I'll I'll give you 2 acres and a cow.\n\nHaven't seen The 2 Acres yet. There we are. That's the joke. Anyway, the only thing that's\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh my god. Oh my god.\n\nSpeaker 1: The the only anything that's interesting about that joke is that it's the Lloyd George joke because Lloyd George believes that the fundamental way to set someone up economically was 2 acres and a cow. And a lot of what we do in Africa at the moment is actually about helping people get a cow. Makes a huge difference. In fact, Robert Maxwell, your old boss, Said that when he was growing up in Ruthenia in the Carpathian mountains, the greatest ambition that he'd had as a young man was to get a cow. That's how you mate yourself in a village.\n\nYeah. Alright. Nothing to do. Over to you for a bit more.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think that was I'm absolutely convinced that Max Muller will have got a lot of laughs out of that joke, Rory, but I I love the way you tried to turn it into a serious Point to the end. I'm gonna tell you to something more serious. Emma Stacey, I'd like to know your thoughts on nurses being balloted to strike, Whether you think we can get the support of the public, and will they understand it's not just about pay, but standards of care given due to shortage in recruitment. Vincent Pettervelle, As a nurse, I have voted for industrial action this week. I'd love to know both of your thoughts on this.\n\nIf we, as a union, vote for strike action, thank you for as always.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, let I mean, well, can let let me start from my sort of funny ex Tory background and say firstly that we should have huge sympathy for the fact that Nurses are incredibly overworked, often very underpaid, and of course it's got much much worse since Brexit because All the immigration regulations about bringing in nurses from other countries haven't kept up with the demand, so we're up hundreds of thousands of people short. And again, it'll come hundreds of thousands more people short over the coming years. So there is a huge problem, but of course, And this isn't really a good answer to nurses, but it's worth thinking in terms of our programme, our podcast, that this is just the thin end of the wedge. The entire public sector is Trained and stretched and is facing 10% rises in inflation, and that's actually often underestimating it. If you If you think about going to the supermarkets at the moment, you'll find that many basic goods have jumped much more than 10% in the last few months.\n\nYou know, people have, you know, if you're buying Cheese at the moment, you'll find it's often up 30, 40%. That's true for a lot of other staple products.\n\nSpeaker 0: You're taking a long time not to answer the question here, Aure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I suppose what I'm saying is I think I've got a lot of sympathy, but we should also be aware that there's gonna be a lot more strike action by many, many more people, And we're gonna find ourselves, I fear, going back to something that's gonna feel more like the 19 seventies. There's gonna be a lot of striking going on. There's gonna be a lot of inflation going on, And it doesn't matter which government comes in, conservative or Labour. They're gonna be really struggling to control prices, wages, and balance the budget.\n\nSpeaker 0: If you were a nurse, would you Yeah. If I was\n\nSpeaker 1: a nurse if I was a nurse, I'd probably go on strike. If I was the government, I'd be completely terrified about what that means, and And I'd be worried even if I was the labor minister.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I I think also there's a consequence here of previous actions. I felt that the even as far back as the coalition government, I felt there was a strategy that was essentially all about not criticizing, but but this constant sort of demanding of public sector workers to do more, A lot of criticism of what they did, and I think that was cranked up under Johnson. Then we had those sort of, you know, clap for carers and don't we love the NHS, And with they were the the angels and all that stuff that was sort of pumped out there. And then they do, I think, get a bit of a kick in the teeth. And honestly, my neighbor's a nurse.\n\nAnd, you know, you talk to people who work in the whole at the moment. They say it really is incredibly pressured, very, very difficult, and they feel all they get is abuse from the government. So I completely understand both Emma and Vincent. And if only we had a government that actually addressed their concerns rather than sought to exploit them, I think that would be better.\n\nSpeaker 1: But I I'm I'm with you, but Addressing concerns is gonna turn out to probably be a much more difficult poison thing for Labour when they take over than than we're acknowledging, just saying that quickly.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Now listen. We talked briefly yesterday about Ukraine. There's a question here from PEOW. To what extent is a possible return of the Republicans to power In 2 years in the states, a factoring Ukraine war.\n\nSurely, if the war is still going at that point and they win the election, Ukraine have an enormous problem. Might Russia start to bank on this?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, at the moment, there's pretty strong bipartisan support for the Ukraine war. That that's one of the things that Biden's doing, which there isn't much republican opposition to. The skepticism It's only coming from the far Trump wing of the party. So the question is, if Trump wins, yes, there is a problem. I think Trump is Has a very, very odd relationship with Putin, and you will have seen interviews with general Flynn, who was his very controversial national security adviser.\n\nSpeaker 0: God, he was awful. Did you\n\nSpeaker 1: see that interview where he was basically attacking Zelensky? Yeah. Yeah. So I I think that that there is a very worrying fringe that people will be concerned about. But at the moment, it looks The leading candidate really at the moment is is DeSantis.\n\nAnd I don't know how much the UK media have been covering DeSantis, but Ron DeSantis Nao seems to be ahead of Trump on a lot of the indicators. He's, part of this strange American phenomenon of these kind of people who I think he went to Yale University, But was also in the United States Navy, but somehow uses this quite establishment background to be very, very anti establishment. He just flew a planeload of Mexican immigrants To Martha's Vineyard, which is the kinda super wealthy retreat of the liberal elite, to try to make a point because he's a Florida politician that The Liberal elite in the United States doesn't really understand immigration because it's not really happening to them in the same way. But, anyway, I don't think DeSantis's views on Russia and Ukraine are actually that, are as concerning as Trump's. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Katie Parker. So Ella Braverman wants to recategorize cannabis as a class a drug. This would have knock on effects for our already overcrowded courts and prisons, not just overcrowded courts, but courts he can barely bit get a case through, Clogging them up even more, is Brabham's proposal just nationalist populist madness?\n\nSpeaker 1: What do you think? Yes. Yes. Well,\n\nSpeaker 0: I mean, cannabis is a class a drug. It's like and, also, you know, we were we were talking yesterday about what, What can we do to kind of I actually think the legalization of cannabis and the the marketization of cannabis, which is happening in a lot of Different parts of the United States, and I think Joe Biden has moved on this fairly recently as well. You could actually see it as a bit of a a bit of a money spinner, but I'm afraid Braverman really is. There was a wonderful, oh, what does this say? Was it Private Eye?\n\nIt was a couple of a headshot of Suella Brahmman and Priti Patel. And Suella Brahmman's speech bubble says, how do you think I'm doing? And Priti Patel says, I think you could probably be a bit more compassionate. I think what Priti Patel is seen as more compassionate than her successor, that we're in we're in real trouble. Right.\n\nQuestion from you. Go on.\n\nSpeaker 1: So, Perry, why do XMP struggle? Rory made a comment in passing last week that XMPs come and find it very difficult to find employment after leaving parliament. Can you expand on this? I imagined it to be the opposite As many seem to fall into comfy roles in the private sector that probably pay a lot more. Now oddly, that that just isn't true, and I I don't know whether you want to talk about labor MPs who are friends of yours and on what's happened.\n\nBut the truth is that the old days may have been true in the 19 sixties 19 seventies where MPs could go into private sector jobs comfortably after they left have have left. Couple of reasons. One of them is that we used to have a lot of nationalized industries in Britain, which were basically controlled by the government, so it was very easy for the government to put ex MPs onto the boards of Nationalized Industries. That's all gone. But also, the reputation of MPs is so low that people don't think there's any status on having on their board Somebody who's been a member of parliament.\n\nIncreasingly, they're looking for if you're a bank or something, looking for someone on your board, you're looking for somebody who knows something about the subject area.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And MPs are not really qualified. I mean, increasingly, they're professional politicians. They many, many of them now have started as counselors. They've started as party activists. They've done almost nothing else in their lives than politics for 20 or 30 years.\n\nAnd unless they're lucky enough to have a professional qualification as an accountant or a lawyer or something like that, it's It's very, very difficult for them to get a job. So, I I mean, do you have you reflect on this? I mean, of you Labour MPs who've left?\n\nSpeaker 0: I I look. I I think if you are The top level. If you look at how much Theresa May gets paid for you know, Theresa May was not the greatest author, but she's in this sort of top league of Big money public speaking sector. I'm sure David Cameron's making lots of money in different ways. Tony Blair makes lots of money.\n\nJohn Major makes lots of money. I think at that level Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's prime minister. I mean, prime minister's\n\nSpeaker 0: You see people and I agree. You see people like George Osborne is making a fortune. Philip Hammond is making a fortune. But I think most MPs I think you're right. I think they struggle.\n\nI think they struggle financially. I think they struggle psychologically. You get good pensions, you guys, don't you? Former MPs get good pensions.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Depends it depends how long you're in the House of Commons, though. And the remember, the pension I don't wanna defend MPs particularly, but the pension, The it's an unusual job because the salary you enter on is the same as the salary that you would have if you'd been there 50 years. It's there's no seniority involved in the job, because every MP is equal, so they all get the same backbench salary, A pension contribution's come off that. It's a decent salary.\n\nIt's more than most people in Britain get, but it's considerably less than you would get as a GP or as a head teacher of a large school, So becoming an MP is definitely not not a way to get wealthy. And\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I remember Eric Heffer Eric Heffer, the Labour MP, always used to say there's there's nothing more x than an SNP.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well, I I I I I talked to somebody who was my predecessor in the government department who was actually looking at Stacking shells at Tesco's after he left. I mean, it's it's, that's that's obviously very extreme. I mean, that's not usually what happens. Usually what happens is they end up in an even more humiliating world, often which is Getting into public affairs.\n\nSo you get paid not a great deal of money to try to promote some private sector company, and then you get into difficulty because you're Accused of lobbying. You're trying to call up your ex colleagues. It's very embarrassing. You sit in the Portcollus, which is the tea rooms, a kind of mot the more modern tea room in the House of Commons, And you see this slightly depressing scene of your former colleagues coming in table to table, trying to hand out brochures, Saying, can I just get 10 minutes of your time? And it's it's it's a bit sad.\n\nYep.\n\nSpeaker 0: A bit sad. Yeah. Now, Jude Carrier, I read today about the tax Breaks being offered to people to set up in Freeport. So I'm very worried about these and what they mean in terms of employment, environmental, and planning protections that Freeport seem to evade. How worried should we be?\n\nWell, Well, I think we should be very worried, and we've talked a lot about this in relation to the whole sovereign individual agenda, low tax, no regulation, piss on the workers kind of thing. And the FTA, the weekend, had a story that even quasi Kuateng has started to get worried. I don't know if you saw this, Rory. Basically said that the LISTRAS has overruled Kuateng, who wanted to put a limit on the number of applications for low tax investment zones. And I guess the the worry, if you're the government and particularly if you're the treasury, is that you risk losing 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 of pounds in in lost taxes, and she's really she's she's saying that we shouldn't have any limit.\n\nWell, is she saying the whole country should become an investment zone?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's completely catastrophic. So if you set up one of these zones. You can get a 100% relief on your, machinery investment. You get a 100% relief for the 1st year on your business Rates. You get a massive holiday on National Insurance.\n\nSo what is so worrying for me, again, from a sort of 1 nation Physically conservative background is that this is potentially a blank cheque which could cost the government £40,000,000,000 a year In the worst case scenario, if you end up with too many of these things opening everywhere, and generally, what the treasury has always argued and would probably continue to argue today is that It just displaces activity from elsewhere. It doesn't help the overall economy. In most cases, it simply moves investments that would be going into the other parts of the country somewhere else, but it doesn't bring new investment time.\n\nSpeaker 0: Are the investment zones part of the anti growth coalition?\n\nSpeaker 1: I the investment zones, sadly, that's a nice question, and I can see where you're coming from there, I think the awful thing is that, actually, it's what worries me more about the whole stuff, which is it's the growth at any cost, But no revenue from the government coalition, and that's what's that's why why I as a more you know, conservatism used to be about prudence and restraint when it came to this stuff. And what worries me is I if I was I we've talked about this in the past, but Keir Starmer needs to turn it around and say, You know, growth at any cost is a very disturbing thing. Here here's a question that I got, maybe quickly on this. Ian Birdsall, please can you explain what a 1 nation conservative is? It's a phrase I just don't understand, and what are you if you're not a 1 nation conservative?\n\nSpeaker 0: Do Do you want\n\nSpeaker 1: me to have a little quick look at that?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, before you do, I remember when we talked about Bill Clinton up in Blackpool, and one one of his, favorite piece of advice, he he once So just remember when they talk about compassionate conservatism, the only word that counts in that is conservatism. So Explain explain 1 nation.\n\nSpeaker 1: The the 1 nation tradition began with Benjamin Disraeli back in 19th century, and it's essentially about an argument about, Yep. Social solidarity about not having a society that's divided between the very rich and the poor, and it became under missus Thatcher a Slogan for people that you know, I'm one of them. Right? So we would have called ourselves moderate or center center right politicians.\n\nSpeaker 0: And she called you wet?\n\nSpeaker 1: And she called us wet. So, yeah, 1 nation, Tories are wet. That's the traditional definition. And the other side of it The dry right wing conservatives who, in the case of this trust, tend to this very libertarian view, which is, Which is the only thing that matters is economics and growth. Just before we go to the break, little little poem, little 18th century poem for you here.\n\nActually, it's Yates on on the 18th century. What he would have said about Liz Truss is she's not really a Tory, definitely not a 1 nation conservative. He's what he would have called A Whig. And he says about these great 18th century conservative thinkers like Burke, Berkeley, Goldsmith, he said, All hated wiggory, that levelling, rancorous, rational sort of mind that never looked out of the eye of a saint Or out of a drunkard's eye, all's wiggery now, and we old men are massed against the world. Nice.\n\nSo we stand for the saints and the drunkards in the 1 nation tradition. Let's go to a break.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Welcome back To the rest of politics, question time with me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And, Rory, are you gonna tell me that you that Poem just came out of your memory bank as opposed to you're sitting at a laptop with access to every piece of information under the sun.\n\nSpeaker 1: Genuinely, genuinely, promise, promise, promise, promise, promise came out of my memory.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, well, excellent. Excellent. Just shows that and that was learnt at the school that The audience in Blackpool said I should bang on about more. We had a vote, didn't we?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think I I learned it actually in Indonesia after I got\n\nSpeaker 0: this school.\n\nSpeaker 1: Here's relevance to Lib Dems. Good question I saw from a guy called Rob Blackburn. As someone highly disillusioned by the collapse of the moderate, sensible conservative party, but not fully confident in the policies and ability of the Labour Party. I find myself wondering where the Lib Dems are in all of this chaos And why they aren't cutting through more? What are your thoughts on this?\n\nWhat do they need to do to find their voice? And I think that is an important question because I think the collapse of moderate sensible conservative party is clear, But I do think that there are he he put his finger on some of the things that people will worry about with Labour, which is, are they fully confident in their fully Policy is fully confident in their ability. And where are the Lib Dems? Where are the Lib Dems, Alastair? What's happened to them?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, they they, of course, had the misfortune of having to Cancel their conference, didn't they, because of the the queen's death? So I suppose that would have given them a bit of national public attention. They've suffered from 2 things that have happened in quick succession. 1, the coalition. I I think Nick Clegg was right to take the Lib Dems into coalition.\n\nI think if you're fighting An election you want government, you go into when you get the chance, but that definitely damaged their brand and their electoral standing thereafter there because of the whole austerity thing and tuition fees and everything else. And then the second thing that happened is that after the last election, you've got to remember that the the coverage that is Particularly across the the national channel, the the big national channels, which then sort of feed down into the rest of the media ecosystem, is dependent upon how many Seats you have in parliament. So even something like question time. I mean, people will probably notice that Ian Blackford is called far more regularly At question time, then, Ed David, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. So these things have had an impact.\n\nBut then added to that, I think they've made a Stake in, echoing Labour's line on Brexit and sort of basically making a gigantic elephant in the room that nobody talks about. They don't have a distinctive economic message. They don't have a distinctive social policy message. They they will probably say, oh, we have lots of policies. It's just people don't know about them.\n\nWell, I'm sorry. In the modern world, that's just tough. You've got to make sure that people do know about them.\n\nSpeaker 1: Did you work with them closely? We I know you were very strongly, obviously, on the remain second referendum side, which the Dems were on in those days. Did you did you have a lot to do with the Lib Dems in those days when you were thrown out of labor? Did you see much more of them then?\n\nSpeaker 0: Not really. I mean, they I voted Lib Dems in in the European elections. But that was about trying to get the Labour Party to change its position, which eventually it did. And the Lib Dems were terribly excited and thought that I was going to become a LibDEM, which, a shum, I never was. And, look, I had a lot I had a lot to do with them, but also had lots to do with, you know, pro Remain Tories during the People's Vote campaign.\n\nBut I think they are in a bit of a tricky position. But, also, I wouldn't rule out that they become very, very significant in this next election because there are parts of the country where for Labour to win, they need the Lib Dems to do pretty well. I mean, that I was down in the Westcountry recently, and, you know, down there, There are some seats that Labour can take. There are an awful lot of seats that are gonna have to be taken by the Lib Dems. And when we were talking yesterday about the polling being so bad For the Tories, don't forget that that the SNP is still polling well in Scotland.\n\nSo that suggests actually that because the Scots are taking into account in the national polls. That suggests Labour are doing even better in England than the polls might indicate. But the Lib Dems are going to have to do well in certain parts of the country if the Tories are gonna get be got rid of. And I think a big driver there's always a central question at any general election. There's usually 1 negative or 1 positive.\n\nAnd then the negative question is, we've gotta get rid of the tories or, you know, can we really afford another term of the tories? And then more positively, you know, has Labour got the positive agenda to get over the line?\n\nSpeaker 1: It's such a it's such a mystery, isn't it? Because given there are so many people, to some extent, you and me, but definitely many, many people who listen to this podcast who feel that they are in the center of British politics and are a bit suspicious of left and right. And and given that actually for many years, the Public opinion was like a kind of bell jar with the votes in the centre and not many votes on either side. It's extraordinary that the Lib Dems have performed historically So badly that the Liberal Party died in England in the- famously in the early twenties,\n\nSpeaker 0: and\n\nSpeaker 1: that it's never really managed to come back in a 100 years, and I I it's it's it's a bit mysterious. When I was running to be London mayor's independent, somebody suggested that I could reach out to the Lib Dems and see if I could become their candidate, And the polling suggested that my vote share would have collapsed from something like 13, 15% Down to 5% if I become the Lib Dem candidate that actually being an independent was a stronger brand than being a Lib Dem In London, sunny then,\n\nSpeaker 0: 2020. I mean, I think the look. We're back to the we've talked about this many, many times, the strength of the 2 parties. Both the main parties strong. Somebody once said to me not long ago of of Labour, the problem with Labour is it's too weak to win and too strong to die.\n\nNow, Now, actually, I think at the moment, Labour is in a pretty good position to win. But the Lib Dems, I think the peak, the modern peak, was the coalition years, And they've paid a price for that. Anthony Bohan. Yep. It sounds like Paul Daker and Nadine Dorries will soon be joining the likes of Baroness Fox of Buckley And lord Lebedeff of Hampton, Siberia, isn't it time to abolish or reform the house of lords?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm a big reform person. I would like to see a house of Lords. None of the politicians would like it, but I'd like to see it composed of people more like crossbenchers. I I was always very, very impressed by the senior judges, diplomats, academics, people like the Amazing. Martin Rees, the, Astronomer Royal in the House of Lords, the quality of their debates was often much, much higher because these guys Knew an incredible amount.\n\nThey'd had very long careers. They had an enormous amount of information. So if you want to see a debate on foreign policy, the House of Lords had a much Higher quality of debate in the House of Commons. On military staff, it's obviously got a lot of generals and defense experts in it, but what we have to do, I'm afraid, is get rid of the donors and the politicians.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But Rory, the problem with it it is part of the legislative process. So what you're describing is a kind of expert debating chamber, which may have a place in our politics, but I think reform has got to go way further than that. Although, I always had this this dream that, In in a sense, we'd have very we'd have a the House of Commons is the center of our kind of democratic debate. We'd have really powerful regional assemblies, And there'd be some kind of link into that.\n\nAnd then we'd also have the European Parliament. We're we're out of that now, so there's no point thinking of that for the time being. Look. I've I've actually written my column for the New European about this this week, pegged to the the new names that have come forward, which I mean, the idea of Paul Daker. I mean, Honestly, Paul Daker, he's he's done so much damage to our political debate.\n\nHe's nothing but an establishment hack who pretends to be an anti establishment. And I felt sort of strangely pleased when I heard that he was definitely going to go there because I think it so debases the whole thing. It it shows that Johnson has learned nothing. It shows Truss has learned nothing. And then, of course, we're gonna get his resignation on us as well, which are going to be truly horrific.\n\nSo I'm hoping this is just another nail in the coffin of the House of Lords.\n\nSpeaker 1: One of the things you will have read, is that he's also proposing to do something very unusual, which is in his resignation honors, push MPs who are currently in the House of Commons into the House of Lords, which would trigger a by election. You'd end up with 7 by elections, which would be Trust doesn't want that. Catastrophic for trust. The the reason I'm very strongly against an elected house of lords is that we would end up In the US problem of the standoff between Congress and Senate, in in a way, what's good about the House of Lords is it doesn't have democratic legitimacy, See, so all it can do is delay legislation. But if you had 2 elected chambers, the people in the upper house would begin to say, well, we're elected just like the lower house.\n\nWe have every right To block legislation, we have just as much democratic legitimacy as they do, and we would then find ourselves in gridlock. So I would much rather Go on the crossbench model, have people who are experts, who represent different professions, lean into diversity in the House of Lords, And make it a really impressive debating chamber, but not have it elected because I think elected would be gridlock.\n\nSpeaker 0: Here's one, Rory. Similar theme. Jay Hearn, hello from North Sydney. I love Sydney. Will the Liberal Democrats and the Greens increase their seats in the next election?\n\nMore than 30% of Australian voters did not vote for a major party in 2021. Communities are now running independents in North South Wales and Victoria lower houses and hope to hold the balance of power. So this is our old friend, the Teals, isn't it? But I don't think that's gonna happen here.\n\nSpeaker 1: It does. Well, the problem is they've got a single transferable vote system, haven't they, which allows them to do, which really helps an independent. I think there's a huge market for it. I think there's an enormous market for TEALS, which is fiscally conservative, Environmentally progressive candidates the center, and I think you could imagine having a really strong, attractive party doing that, but I can't quite see the La Dembs being that party. Adam Blackburn, would right wing media back Labour again?\n\nSo the recent polling, are we likely to see the right wing aligned media ever move to Supporting Labour, or have things changed since new Labour and these publications are too far down the rabbit hole to want to realign? Would Murdoch want to back a horse Bound to lose, though?\n\nSpeaker 0: Don't know. Don't know. Don't really care that much.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, you do care, Alice? You're always saying the right wing media is The key to the thing, aren't you?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I've never said it's the key. I think it's the key to the framing of the debate, and that's why I rail at the broadcasters from time to time. No. Look.\n\nI'd rather because all of them took politics seriously, treated all the parties reasonably fairly, and had at least some separation of news and comment. That's gone. It's Just\n\nSpeaker 1: That's not\n\nSpeaker 0: gonna happen,\n\nSpeaker 1: and and that's not true of the Mirror of the Guardian either.\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I agree. I agree. I think will they shift? I I don't know.\n\nA lot depends on how they I mean, you look at the express literally every day. It's just like a Truss fanzine. It's gone from being a Johnson fanzine to being a Truss fanzine. The Mail sort of, you know, is trying to sort of face a little bit both ways. I haven't really seen much of The Sun recently.\n\nI noticed the Sunday times have become much more critical. So I suppose it's not impossible, but I think at this stage, it's unlikely.\n\nSpeaker 1: I think Murdoch, who's a terrifying figure in so many ways, but I think he likes the winner. And if he concludes that this trust is incompetent and isn't gonna win. I think it's very likely that he'll\n\nSpeaker 0: change. Mhmm. But don't forget as well, he's he's, you know, he's he's how can I put this gently? He's he's getting on. Karl Marx.\n\nI don't think he's the yeah. I don't think he's the Karl Marx because I I saw his grave recently when I went up to see I really don't. Philip Gouldsgrave and my friend John Merritt. This This one is a question directly to me and directly to you. Alastair, did you vote for Labor under Jeremy Corbyn?\n\nYes. I did. And would you expect Corbyn supporters to still vote Labor under Keir Summer? Yes. I would.\n\nRory Stewart, who will you vote for in the next election?\n\nSpeaker 1: Cor blimey. It's a difficult one, isn't it? Really difficult one. I would find it impossible to vote, I'm afraid at the moment for Liz Truss' conservative party. I'm just horrified by the direction.\n\nIt's not what I ever believed in. The thing for me which makes it difficult, and I think for Some of my colleagues who are still in parliament is that, obviously, we have been aware for a dozen years or more, or maybe many of us, 20 years, that being a conservative It is very, very unpopular that many people think that we are a very, very nasty party, that we're actually out there deliberately damaged people, and we've been trying to defend ourselves and say, no. That isn't what we're about. We are a party that believes In prudence at home, restraint to board, love of tradition, evolution not revolution, pragmatism, local communities. And now we have this trust, and this trust is like the worst possible vision.\n\nIt it feels to me, as I imagine Jeremy Corbyn will have felt To moderate Labour voters that Corbyn sort of revealed aside of far left Labour socialism that many moderate Labour MPs had Been trying to deny and say we're not a party run by this conflict. So Liz Truss is the kind of Jeremy Corbyn of our party?\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. So you but you haven't answered the question. You said you'd find it hard to vote for Liz Truss.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, so I I wouldn't I wouldn't vote for this, and I'm and I'm surprised you were prepared to vote for Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party. I'm actually quite slightly shocked by that.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I ventured Labour because I thought that was the only way to get rid of the Tories, and I'd I I I I\n\nSpeaker 1: I you thought Jeremy Corbyn would have been better than Theresa May?\n\nSpeaker 0: Theresa May wasn't standing. It was Boris Johnson.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, how did she vote in 2017 when she\n\nSpeaker 0: was I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. Yeah. I've voted I've voted for Jeremy then. But To be honest, I think I think one of the reasons Theresa May got a majority is people didn't actually think Jeremy Corbyn could win.\n\nAnd I think one of the reasons that Boris Johnson won as As well as he did, it was because people by then thought that Jeremy Corbyn might win. But I wanted to get a kind of, you know, progressive alliance, I guess, is what I was after. But I think now, I do think that a combination and And even this coalition against growth, whatever it was she came up with, they're trying to get this concept into the public mind that a coalition will be terrible, than if it's sort of Keir Starmer and Nicola Sturgeon or Keir Starmer and and Ed Davey. But, actually, one of the upsides of Ed Davey is I don't think people see him as as threatening in a way that maybe they did with Joe Swinson. I hope you vote Labor, Roy, but I also hope that if it's in a seat that the Liberal Democrats can win and Labor can't, that you'd maybe vote tactically.\n\nSpeaker 1: Gabriela, WikiLeaks.\n\nSpeaker 0: You haven't answered the question. You haven't answered the question. No.\n\nSpeaker 1: I don't I I'm definitely not gonna vote for Liz Truss' conservative party, but I'll have to work out what I do when I get into that.\n\nSpeaker 0: And and have you not yet decided?\n\nSpeaker 1: I have not yet decided, no. I've not yet decided. Not yet decided. Okay. Here's here's here's a question.\n\nHow do we build political community? EE Fry. Your Blackpool show gave me a sense of political community I'd not felt in an extremely long time. I think that was because the Max Miller jokes that we told are music hall jokes. I felt safe for the first time in ages.\n\nHow do we build on that? How do we create a community for the disenfranchised, politically homeless citizens of nowhere? What Do I do now? There we are. So what does EE Fry do now?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, EE Fry, what do you do now? First of all, you you wait excitedly for my next book, which is going to be called, what can I do? And then I think there'll be lots of the answers in there. I'm glad that E. E.\n\nFry felt that about our gathering. I think it's been a general relation in the whole. Labour would have won. But I think there were Lib Dems in there. I think there were Greens in there.\n\nI think there were Tories. I think there were young people who were too young to vote. And I think thinking about it in the concept of the political community, I think we do have to win this idea That it's possible to have serious, intelligent, informed debate that we don't always have to agree with every Dot and comma of everything that the other person is saying, but we can still kind of get along. And I think the other thing we have to do, we have to keep calling out The stuff that we disagree with and the stuff that we don't like and the responsibility to call it out is even greater when the people who are doing the worst things are the people in power. And then I'd say to EE Fry, join a party.\n\nWhatever your politics are, join a party. Join campaigns, be active, stay active, get active, and just don't give up hope.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Now final one. I think we're coming up towards the end here. At from Escobar, I came all the way from Warsaw to see you.\n\nSo he came from Warsaw to Blackpool. That's quite the journey, particularly with the train strikes on. You've not mentioned Poland much in your podcast. What is your take on Poland's crazy right wing government?\n\nSpeaker 0: They're crazy.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Well, just just to remind people, so Law and Justice party, PIC fights European Union, taking a very hard line approach to women's rights. It's tried to muzzle independent media, done strange stuff for the courts. So it's very much a nativist populist government, but it's one that, of course, has caused a lot of confusion. I mean, it's disintegrating European democratic values, But, of course, the war in Ukraine has given us an opportunity to project itself as the great champion of European solidarity in defense of Ukraine and democratic values.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, first of all, I'm I think we should thank him. If he if he genuinely came to Blackpool just to see us, I I feel rather bad because when you did at one point ask people how far they'd come, nobody shouted out Warsaw. I think Chichester was the furthest away that I heard. So he came from Warsaw. I I sort of feel bad that we didn't give him lots of love and special attention.\n\nSpeaker 1: We should've done. We should've done.\n\nSpeaker 0: We should've got him backstage and have a look around and stuff. But, look, I I think there's there are 2 reasons, I think, why Poland and its government doesn't get quite the opprobrium that others do. One is that because, actually, there most people these days know polls. There are a lot of polls. A lot have gone back, but we you know, Poles have become a pretty big part of British life, and and I think, actually, that's maybe now people get their assessment of Poland through the fact that we know more Polish people, And they seem quite nice, and they're very hardworking, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nBut the second thing is that Orban takes most of the heat on the whole sort of busy grad stuff, And I think that Poland stays a little bit under the radar. And your final point about Ukraine, I think, is incredibly important. They have They have shown a very different side to themselves in relation to Ukraine. And because Ukraine has been so defining in in recent months, that has maybe, taking the heat off them as well. But I\n\nSpeaker 1: mean, the change is extraordinary, isn't it? Because they were flirting, really, with kinda right wing nativist populism and the Authoritarian regimes, and then they flipped around. And they went from you remember they were when there was this problem in Belarus, there were water cannons and truncheons, The polls driving back Belarusian migrants to the border suddenly flipped to taking 1 a half 1000000 Ukrainians almost overnight into Poland. So it's it's been a very interesting sort of reshaping, and it it it's it's a sign that you can be a strong part of European Political values, oddly, while not signing up to the full democratic agenda. Anyway, I think it's something we should explore more.\n\nMaybe we should, Well, maybe we should do a podcast in in Poland someday.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. Go to Poland. Absolutely. We should get a train.\n\nSpeaker 1: We should get a train.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because you spend too much time on airplanes, Rory, and you and you would, I noticed your defense of your flying. At least I admitted I felt guilty about it. I felt your defense didn't go down well with the audience.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I sort of thought it was a bit bit rich when I, For the sake of the audience, I had just completely shattered myself flying all the way from Jordan to Blackpool and then Blackpool to Marrakesh to be attacked for getting on a plane. I thought, Screw you. I'll do it on I'll do it on video\n\nSpeaker 0: conferencing next time. Here's here's an invitation to get on another very long flight. Somebody with a wonderful name of Fernanda Diaz. I'm a dual British Argentine citizen living in Argentina since last year. I want to extend a running invitation to you both to come and visit because Rory Welch remarked he knew very little about Latin America.\n\nSo, Fernanda, I don't know who you are. I don't know what you do, But thank you for the invitation, and it sounds very, very well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I think we'll be traveling by boat as part of your as part of Alice's new carbon retention.\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, we could swim. We could swim Has you bottled out of the black pool swim?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I I I would love to hear about your black pool swim, Elsa. How did it go?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, because you bottled out And because\n\nSpeaker 1: the tide was I didn't even speak\n\nSpeaker 0: Because the tide was so far out\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Derry me. This is desperate.\n\nSpeaker 0: Decided to leave early And get home, but I went to the line.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's the one bit I I know I never get to give you comms advice because you're a much more able comms person to me, but my small bit of comms advice is Before you accuse somebody else of bottling out of a swim, check you've done the swim yourself. Alright, guys. On that, farewell.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best.",
