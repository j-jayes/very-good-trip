Welcome to the Restless Politics Question Time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. Very good. And, Alastair, look, we've got a lot of lovely stuff to get going on. And there's a lovely question from Richie Crichton on congressman Santos from the United States, which I'd love to get on to. But the first question I'd like to hit you with is about global ownership of British Football before we get on to gritty American politics. Two questions from Andrew. Is it naive to think we can prevent our most venerable football clubs from becoming vehicles For vampiric capitalists and dubious potentates, are we forced to accept that the people's game could be chiseled away from us like our public utilities, a consequence of open market. So would you tell us a little bit about what's going on in football? Oh, well, well, I'm I'm imagining the question is driven. And we had quite a few on this. But by the the bid that is in well, 2 bids that are in to buy Manchester United, one of the biggest football brands in the world. And and who who owned them before? So tell us a little bit about Well, the Glazers. The this American, business family, the Glazers, who are There's a slogan amongst Manchester United fans, love United, hate the Glazers. Oh, dear. That's a bit unfortunate. And how long have they owned it for? They've had it for years. Basically, they took the club over. There's a lot of sort of, controversy about the the means by which they did it by Basically, buying the club with the club's own money as it were. And since then, the fans have run a sort of never ending campaign to try and get them out of the club. Including at one point, there was a point in the in this story when the the predominant color on the terrace was yellow and green, which was the color of the team that Preceded Manchester United. But but but, sorry, just for those of you who don't understand, so Ferguson was around from 86 to 2013 or something, Some incredible kind of period. Is that right? Alex Ferguson managing Manchester United. He was there for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. And somewhere in the middle of that period, the Glazers came in aboard. But Yeah. Actually, it was quite successful under them. Right? I mean, it it was a good period for the club. Yeah. But how much was that to do with what was already there and and and whether that is to do. But I think that the what the fans don't like about the club is they feel that it's been taken away from them. They don't feel the same relationship with the club that they had. The they see the Glazers as kind of almost almost like absent landlords. The the investment hasn't been there. Now I know that sounds ridiculous because of the Lots of money that they pay for players and that they salaries and so forth. But Manchester United have kind of fallen. Is the same true with Chelsea and Abramovich? I mean, is this just a general Facts whenever you get bought by a foreign owner? Well, I'll tell you what's interesting. If you go through or very, very quickly go through all the clubs in the Premier League, Arsenal, American, Aston Villa, American, Bournemouth, America, Brentford, British, Matthew Benham, a gambler, Brian and Hovalvian, Tony Bloom, Ditto, Chelsea, now American, was Russian. Crystal Palace, Steve Parish is is still a big factor there, but he own he's only now got 10%. The rest are all American. Everton Egyptian, Fulham American, Leeds Italian and American, Leicester Thailand, Liverpool American, Manchester City, Abu Dhabi, America and China. China's only 1%, mind you. Manchester United, the Glazers. Newcastle United, Saudi. Nottingham Forest, Greece. Southampton, British, and Switzerland, Tottenham, England, West Ham United, Wales, Welsh, David Sullivan, and Czech, And Wolverhampton Wanderers' China. Woah. So to answer the question, is the game be chiseled away from us like our public utilities? It's certainly come, a massive global industry. And just quick on that because you're you know a lot about Germany. My understanding is that, traditionally, in Germany, the clubs were Owned by the fans. And is that not true even for huge clubs like Barcelona that they're controlled by the fans? The fans in Barcelona do have a lot more say. They, for example, elect the president. Right. But the club ownership in Germany is driven by this thing called the 51% rule. So the fans do have A stake in the running of the club. And I'm a big fan of German football for lots of reasons, but one of them is that I think that has improved the quality of the clubs. I think it improves the relationship with the fans, and it's also helped to keep prices down as well. And it's also meant that they've concentrated much more on youth development, is that right, in Germany? Yeah. But I think look. Most of our clubs do Do pretty you know, they've got pretty good academies and and all that stuff. But I just think what we're seeing now with with football. So the 2 people are now going for Manchester United. 1st guy is Jim Ratcliffe, who is a billionaire. He he already runs the team INEOS in cycling. He's He runs he owns a nice football club, and the other guy is Sheikh Yassim bin Hamad Al Thani, son of an ex Qatari prime minister. And, of course, that's leading to because, you know, I don't think the sort of money that you're gonna be talking about to buy Manchester United is a lot of money. We're talking well into the billions. And, of course, the ICsaris already own Paris Saint Germain. Right. There's still this talk around the place, Despite Gary Neville's brilliant protestations against it of a European Super League Right. That appears to be the direction of travel that a lot of the big clubs want to go in. Okay. Tell us a little bit about that. The idea there is that you put Barcelona, Madrid into a a Super League with Manchester United. With Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint Germain, the Italian clubs, Juventus, I guess. And the other thing that really sort of upset a lot of football fans, was the idea that a bit like the American, the NFL, it would be, you know, you'd be in, and then you'd you'd be in the club. Basically, you'd buy your way in. So anyway, I think it it does underline the the the sheer I can remember way, way, way back When Rupert Murdoch tried to buy Manchester United, one of his companies tried to buy Manchester United. And, of course, at the time, he was also the owner of, You know, the main TV company covering live Premier League football. And there was an obvious sort of, you know, potential conflict there. But do you know what? I think I'm right in saying that I don't think anybody has ever been stopped from owning a football club on the fit and proper person test. Where, Andrew, the questioner is onto something. Is this thing about I think it's almost like the the football and the business of football, like a lot of businesses, has kinda become Too big to fail, and it's become such an important part of our culture, of our image abroad, and so forth. Now Tracy Crouch Yep. Who was my colleague? Yep. Enter parliament with me in 2010. Yep. Right. Well, I'm about to say something. I don't say often. She's a Tory MP and I really like her. Good. She's she's great, isn't she? And she she did this review, the fan led football review. And Gary Neville, who knows his stuff, He certainly knows a lot more about football than I do. And he said he thought it was a really, really good piece of work. And one of the things that was being proposed is this idea of a football regulator. Right. Now Johnson sort of I can't remember what he did with it. Nothing. Trust wasn't there long enough. And I don't know at this stage whether Rishi Sunak is taking and interest. But I think that there's a I think there is a sense amongst a lot of football fans that football is becoming very, very distant from them. And and part of that is ticket precedent. I mean, so why didn't you as Labour, why don't you and the future Labour government bring in a rule like this German fifty plus one rule where the commercial people can't own more than 49%, and the fans and the clubs Keep control and keep the ticket prices down, keep the attendance up? You could do that. You could do that. I think you'd face a hell of a lot of opposition from within the industry, but I think you'd have a lot of support from that within the the football the broader football community. We didn't do it because I think it I I don't think that I don't think we were there. I think it was the It was the start of this process. I mean, I'm I I I do remember when Abramovich bought Chelsea. I remember the the headline, you know, the obvious one, Chelski, that was sort of all over the papers. But it was such a big thing. But now it's kinda commonplace when I went through that list. And by the way, when you go down into the championship and below, You'll see an awful lot of non British owners are there as well, including at Burnley. We've got American owners now, and that's because British football is such a big global industry. Okay. Very good. Well, Alastair, I'm very grateful we got you on that because it is something you know an enormous amount about that I know nothing about. And Well, believe me, there will still be lots of people coming on saying, god, he was talking rubbish. All we should have said was this because it's one of those Sundays that does tend to provoke. Thank goodness I get to talk about the Highlands of Central Afghanistan I'm gonna have fewer people going I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you a tough one. If you're gonna give me a tough one, I'm gonna give you a tough one. Nick Simpson, why do you guys believe That the latest front on the conspiracy culture wars is the 15 minute city idea of having shops and services near your home. It seems odd that this is what's been targeted. Is this just random chance, or are there forces that are threatened by this concept? Well, it's amazing, isn't it? So 15 minute city was something I was trying to run on when I was running to be Yeah. An independent to be mayor of London. Something that Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, has done a great job. The idea of 15 minute city is that everything should be within 15 minutes' walk or at most cycle ride from where you are, and it's a lovely idea. I think of new urbanism, mixed use, and it's something we badly need in London. I mean, I I remember meeting Afghan friends up in North London, and, You know, I thought we'll go and have a cup of tea, which would be a normal thing to do in Afghanistan. We had to walk 25 minutes to a Sainsbury's to get a cup of tea, and I realized that there was a complete absence of the sort of dense community structures in life which make life worth living in a city in many, many parts of London. So, anyway, in Oxford, they're trying to Pushed ahead. They're also trying to put restrictions on people driving their cars into Central Oxford. And people have decided in a massive Sort of global outcry against this, including this slightly creepy figure, Jordan Peterson, who's this right wing Canadian Social media advocate that this is an attempt to lock people in their homes as part of a world government's attempt, which began with COVID, To try to take control of our lives and stop us visiting our mums. Yes. The World Economic Forum. They they've come up with this dastardly plan. I mean, how do it it does seem to be incredible these these how these conspiracy theories develop and and the things that get targeted. Farage was at it. There was a Tory MP in the comments the other day talking about it. Nick Fletcher. Richard Sterling's asked about this thing, international socialist conspiracy. So it's very interesting. So restrictions on cars in Europe are increasingly being seen as socialist. Now that that's, again, I think part of us endlessly just sort of picking up from the United States where there's a sort of strong association of Liberals being the people who are stopping you getting wanting to have some big gas guzzler. No. It's extraordinary. And the only thing that I suppose you might say, which people pointed out to me in London, which is true, is that sometimes the restrictions on car use, So restrictions on car use in Outer London can have a disproportionate impact on people on low incomes with older cars that have to pay more Because their cars don't qualify for exemptions, and they need their cars to get to work, and that it is easier for people living in sort of zone 2 in London To to be high high and mighty about not using cars. As I understand it, the Oxford thing, where some of these counselors and officials are getting all sorts of abuse and people from around the world sort of getting on at them and saying you're part of, you know, some terrible globalist international plot. We were talking on the main podcast about biodiversity and about the climate crisis. You know, for councils to try to do something to get more people to walk and cycle is not a bad thing, and to slow down in cities as you don't knock as many kids over. Above all for air pollution, so we're still in a world in which At least 26,000, but maybe 50,000 people a year in Britain are dying prematurely because of air pollution, With a lot of that coming out of the tail end of vehicles. So stopping people doing it is good particularly for our children, for the elderly. But But conspiracy theories I mean, I don't know whether you've been on the receiving end of them. My big one, I I went to I was invited to Bilderberg conference. And as soon as this came out, There was questions in the House of Commons where, you know, Ken Clark had to defend at the dispatch box Rory Stewart's attendance at Bilderberg Conference. And some of my constituents who are more on the kind of BNP UKIP end started saying that this meant that I was a a lizard king, And I couldn't quite work out whether I'd sort of been a lizard before I was invited to Build A Boat Conference or whether I'd sort of grown a tail after my attendance. I think you have to be a lizard to qualify. To qualify in the 1st place. Do you do you ever get hit by conspiracy theories? I don't know if it's a conspiracy. I don't think so. Oh, oh, I Probably. Sort of quickly sorry. I've realized people don't know what the conference is. So the conference conference is a a conference which has been going for a number of years. Small conference invites a lot of fancy people, politicians, business leaders, and has the kind of earnest conversations you have in every conference around the world. I mean, You talk about the state of the world. You scratch your head about China. You talk about Taiwan, and you get some gloomy economists talking about inflation. What do you think it says about people's relationship with the world though that they So many people seem to want these they want to own these conspiracy theories. I suppose the one I get a little bit is from the The Corbynist left sometimes accuse me of having deliberately tried to help the Tories win an election. Is that a conspiracy theory, or is that just a sort of insult? I don't know. Okay. Here we are. I'm gonna get some quicker questions going. Here's a question for you. Live tweets from the underground. What do you make of Keir Starmer banning Corbyn from standing as a Labour MP And telling people who supported him to leave the party. That's what Boris Johnson did to me. It is. And I I think it's what really soon I should do to Boris Johnson. Look. Keir Starmer did a speech last week where he set out how far he thought the Labour Party had changed since Jeremy Corbyn, the whole kind of Story of antisemitism. The Labour Party has now been sort of given a pretty clean bill of health because of the changes that have been made. And I think the sense is that Jeremy Corbyn Still doesn't really get it on that front. I've actually just been reading David Bedell's book, Jews Don't Count, which is, As you'd expect from David Badell, very funny in parts, but it's also incredibly serious. And it does make you think about this sort of he talks about his hierarchy of racism and that Antisemitism is is almost like sort of the the racism that progressives don't think is as bad as the others. And so I think Keir's basically saying, You know, Jeremy Corbyn, whatever his strengths, whatever, you know, good he's done for in the past, the You know, he he the way he handled that and the way that he allowed the anti Semitism crisis to develop within the party means that he shouldn't stand as a candidate. Well, there we are. Okay. I mean, I'm obviously depressed about it because I don't like being chucked out myself. I think these things should be big, big, tents, And they shouldn't I think it's a a mistake in British politics to make these groups too narrow, and I think it's particularly brutal to do it to someone who's been that Senior. And that's like kicking out Ken Clarke. So why don't we take a quick break and then come back and do rattle through some questions after the break, Welcome back to Restless Politics. One thing quickly, just to thank All of you who've signed up for the rest of this politics newsletter, I hope you're enjoying it.

Have a look on our Twitter, Instagram, or email restispolitics@gmail.com, and we'll sign you up from that free mailing list. Right. Ask the questions. Now we weren't getting through quickly enough, so let's try this one. What, Tyler, can Alastair admit to any upsides of being out of the EU? I'm struggling on that one. So that was very, very quick. Doubt with. Done. Here's one for you. MP's expenses, Matthew Wilcox. Yep. X MP's expenses often written about as if comparable to normal expenses that an office employee might submit. Is this a false equivalence? Can you explain why 1,000 in expenses might actually be legitimate in value? Yes. Let me explain that. So There's something actually pretty outrageous there. You often see, and I found this as an MP, so and so spent a £160,000 on their expenses. When you look through those items, you'll discover that that almost all of that will be the cost of their constituency office. So those will be the people who are working very hard and are processing in case my constituency office and other people are busy. I think you got Something like 25,000 emails and letters a year, all of which needed to be replied to, constituency events organized. It's a serious business. And, actually, MPs have much, much smaller staffs than their US equivalents would have. So these aren't, as you might imagine, people sort of Buying champagne on the company. These are people using the money to run the basic operations of their life. And it's also true that MPs who are in Northern constituencies, you know, people who are up in Scotland coming down to London, need to spend the night in London, and it's very weird for the public to say this is outrageous. Now there were definitely abuses in the past, Definite definite abuse in the past, and there may still be MPs fiddling their expenses now. But the vast majority of MPs are very, very careful, and a lot of the stuff is Just Twitter bait. Mhmm. Nicola Bully case. This is a question from Felix Trimboss, and we had quite a few about this. I wonder if you might briefly discuss the standards of reporting around the appearance of Nicola Bully, the subsequent discovery by walkers. The family particularly criticized press intrusion. However, I noticed The mail online omitted those sentences from the statement when they published the statement in full, in quotes, and focus their coverage on alleged failings by the police. Do you think the media whipped up criticism and the police to draw attention away from the way they have stoked the unwelcome social media speculation, or will news organizations always be criticized for their handling sort of story. And, of course, we should also add that 2 of the TV 2 of the broadcasters, ITV and Sky, were also named as having been overly in intrusive. So tell us a bit about this because well, firstly, tell us a bit about Nicol Bolle, and then you you were a journalist. Right? So you were right in the heart of The the bad old days, 19 eighties, when people were accused of a lot of this, weren't they? Yeah. I think, I mean, the the it was sort of pre that era was pre mobile phones and all the hacking and all that and stuff. But, certainly, I think there was a lot of journalism through time is often pushed right at the edges. But I think when you've been through The whole thing of the Leveson inquiry, Milly Dowler's death, and the which is what led to the Leveson inquiry ultimately, and the press Constantly saying that, you know, they will get their own house in order. But it does seem to be, in this case, 2 things coming together. So Niccolabulli goes missing. It becomes a sort of major media story. And the press, According to the family and according to the police who've been speaking on their behalf, overstepped them up repeatedly, both in terms of misrepresenting people, in terms intrusions from their privacy and and now on their grief and so forth. And so, you know, there was an interesting debate on the radio this morning where People were talking about whether the press will ever, agree to any kind of genuine regulation. IPSO, is the latest manifestation of the press complaints commission. They've always been, in my view, bodies of the press, for the press, by the press. And I think that's what we have. And but I think it's typical that newspapers would take out. So they're they're happy to say ITV and Sky have been criticized. They're happy to say that the police have been criticized. But criticism of themselves just sort of finds its way nicely to the spike. Very good. Okay. Now World Bank present replacement, The Dogfather. I like that name, The Dogfather. Who'd be the best place to replace the head of the World Bank, David Malpass? Oh, it's gotta be The Dogfather. It's gotta be the dog father himself. Very good. Kindly can the dog father not do it? Dog father, please. And what about what about what about Gordon? What about Gordon? Could be Gordon. Could be Gordon. That's very good. I'm afraid it's gonna be an American. Could be Larry Summers. Larry Summers putting his glasses up the job. Does it have to be an American? The the the Americans But but it's an American appointment. It would be very odd for them not to appoint an American. They never done Never not had an American The Americans like Gordon? They like Gordon. Now here's one, Rory. Brian Keating. Yep. Please, he says, please can you discuss the new voter ID rules? And I think we should because I'm very worried about these. I I think that this You you've you've done a bit of it, haven't you? So just just I'll do a little explainer, and then you'll give your Yeah. Comments. So The government's introducing new voter ID rules, and there's not much evidence really of voter fraud at all in Britain. I'm I'm sorry. Not not evidence of that kind of fraud of People turning up and voting when they're not supposed to vote. There's been other types of voter fraud. In fact, there's been a terrible case with an ex Labour mayor in Tower Hamlets who got up to all kinds of horrible business during elections, but Not that kind of effort. The government's now pushing for much, much tighter ID, and the criticism of it is that this is ID that older people tend to have. And Unless you're a younger person with a driving license or a passport, it's gonna become more difficult for you to vote. So I think you asked to see this as a kind of suppression of younger voters. Well, I think it could be because, look, this is this is a a new law that's being brought in without a problem to address. I mean, the The problem, as you say, is is is next to non existent. And now you've got the electoral administrators saying that they're really worried That they will not be able to bring this in time for the May 2023 elections, which is when it's due to begin with us. We're we're talking a few weeks' time. And most people don't know this is happening. Most people will just turn up as they normally have. Doubtless the government will pay for a few adverts to go on the television, but, You know, in the end, so what? I just I can't see the reason why they're doing this, why they're devoting so much parliamentary time to it, So much political capital being used on it unless it's sort of to get the right people to vote and the wrong people not to vote. Yeah. It's odd, isn't it? Or some strange culture war that I can't quite get my head around. Thoughts on national service. So this relates to the interview with David Lammy, John Arthross, what are your opinions on national service or progressive national service focused on neglected jobs such as fruit picking, social care, rewilding, run the military? I was very much in favor of this. When I was running to be leader of the conservative party, I tried to push for a citizens national service. The idea was very, very much not A military type of service, but to go for a commitment people doing this form of social service. Mhmm. What what do you think about it? No. I'd be in favor of that. I think military service less so. Although I do think, by the way, we're gonna have to there's gonna have to be a major sort of strategic review right across the NATO countries given what's going on in in Ukraine. But I wouldn't be in favor of military service. But I I also think there's a very interesting paradox, Which I came across when I was doing the research for this book I've written, which is that young people in general are very, very socially conscious. Okay? And yet, they are less civically engaged than when you and I were growing up. And that's, you know, research that shows that fewer than a third of people now aged aged to 18 to 24 Say that they would be willing to work together with others on something to improve my neighborhood. And that is well, well, well down on this on the the the same question. It's almost halved. Well, there's also this terrifying statistics, I think. You you would have seen that a very large number of young people say that a good military government would be better than the current democracy in Britain. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe maybe they want they want the military kind of national service, and we want the The volunteering and doing good things kind of national service. Congressman Santos, Richie Crichton, would you like to discuss the current with George Santos in the US. Any comparison to politicians telling fibs about their backgrounds in the UK? So, I mean, people who haven't been following this, which I guess many, many people will have done, but It is the most staggering story. Congressman Santos is a Republican congressman who claimed to work for Goldman Sachs, didn't, claimed to be Jewish and descended from holocaust survivors, wasn't. Claimed to go on to an elite college, which he didn't do. Claimed to run a charity, which didn't exist. Claimed to know victims of a nightclub shooting, which he didn't. His mother, he claims, died twice, once in 911, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So, and yet, somehow, the Republicans are still gathering around him, although there was a great standoff with Mitch Romney Yeah. Trying to get him to move to back. Any thoughts on Santos? Any thoughts on US, UK equivalents? Well, look, I know it's of a different order when you go through them like that, But I think if you were to look at the life story and the life and times of Alexander Boris D'Pfeffer Johnson, there's a guy who doesn't mind telling big fat lies, and he thinks he can be prime minister again. That's that's true. Different type of lie though, isn't it? Yeah. Do you know the one that I've spotted a lot in recent years in politics. It's this this thing about people exaggerating their their academic qualifications and and plagiarizing theses. Quite a lot of politicians seem to get dull on And Germans, particularly. It's a big deal in Germany, isn't it? I think there've been 3 or 4 German politicians That's a good one. AI AI is going to obviously make that even more prevalent. Look, George Santos is a ridiculous character. He's truly ridiculous, and and there's been some wonderful protests in his, in his district to people basically saying, like, you know, you're just so embarrassing, you books. I you cannot be our representative. But he just sort of He just smiles benignly and carries on and goes and makes up more stories. But I guess it's a logical extension of Trump's alternative facts, isn't it? Invent your own story. Make your own story. It's just so extraordinary. I love the mother died twice, once in 911. Poor mom. How does she feel? Here's what we read. George Capell, what did Rory and Alastair think about the treatment of the BBC in India after the documentary on Modi? Have they seen the documentary? No, not in my case. What do they think about religious division and Hindu nationalism in India India more generally? How should the UK respond to this? And this is I I don't know if you've seen this, but the the BBC headquarters were raided. Audience were raided. Yeah. On trumped up tax charges. Yeah. Which relates I mean, we were talking about Modi and populism. I mean, it's a very, very difficult issue. It is definitely a populist government. Modi has been associated with anti Muslim rhetoric since these horrifying riots when he was Running Gujarat, we talked about that too. There are Hindu nationalist militia who do these very, very sinister proto fascist parades in the street, And it's something that I think we need to call out much more. Mhmm. But it's also something which is very tense In British politics, I mean, Modi, when he comes over to Europe, does these huge rallies, France, Britain, where enormous numbers of people turn up. Many friends of mine who are Indians are cautious about my openly criticizing and calling out Modi for what he does, And I think it's horrifying, and I think the BBC documentary was careful and justified, and this is very unfair. I did did I didn't see if anybody from the government Spoke up to the BBC. I didn't I didn't notice if they did or they didn't. No. I didn't see that either. I think the fact that neither of us noticed it suggested they Maybe not being as well, they I think But there is a real issue around this because, there's a big competition amongst both political parties of courting British Asian votes Much of the British Asian community remains very committed towards Modi, and I think that may be why we haven't heard much criticism. And you've got the government Still hopeful of trying to get some sort of trade deal at some point. Now here's one Rory, very personal to all of us, but I think it's a very nice question. James Counter, How have you learned to deal with the loss of someone close to you? I know this is mental health, not politics question, but you bridge that gap occasionally. Okay. I'll start 1st. And then, Hanover, gee, so my my father died, who I was very, very close to. He died at the age of 92. I was with him when he died, And, actually, I tried to resuscitate him and and didn't didn't succeed. So I was with him when he was alive, and I Was the with him for his last words and then with him as as he died. I I don't know whether there's any Strong answer to that. I mean, I felt with my father that I was very, very lucky that I had a very good relationship with him and that we'd spent a lot of time together talking. And, therefore, In a way, I didn't feel so much that there was anything that we were we were missing that had been undone. But but, Alistair, over over to you, it's something you thought about much more than me. Well, I'm a great believer in crime. I think, actually, letting it all out when you feel like letting it out, and sometimes in the strangest of circumstances. My sister was Telling me the other day that we both we've lost both of our brothers. And, she bumped into the the doctor that was looking after 1 of our brothers when he was When he was ill and she just bumped into him outside the cafe and she just saw him and just burst into tears, and it was obviously that's A form of grief, and I'm a great believer in that. I think if you feel like crying, you should cry. I think the second thing I would say is I'd honestly, Rory, I think listening to music When you're feeling sad is, is a great thing to do, even if, again, that makes you you cry. I think writing is very good for grief. I think sometimes writing letters to the person that you miss, is a good thing to do, even though you know it's not going to go anywhere. And I think the other thing, when my when my mom died, she and as you know, I was in Jordan where you live, and she died, and while she was dead by the time I got And we found in in her papers this poem that she wanted us to read at the funeral. And I now Send this to anybody I hear of in in including this week. I had an extraordinary situation this year. I think I told you before about a musician called Stacy Kent, Who I came across about a year ago in France. I just heard her in the background in a restaurant, and I tweeted about this incredible voice I've just come across. Oh, she's become quite friendly, and I'm going to see her in, when she's in Ronnie Scott's in April. And, Anyway, I sent her a message randomly about Next to Nothing, when I was in Switzerland. Oh, that's right. I'd heard her music in a lift in a hotel. You won't believe I've just heard in a lift. And she sent me a version which she has just recorded of Namakita Pa by Jack Brell, who is my favorite musician of all time. And she said it was nice to get your message out the blue. I've been thinking a lot about Parent and child relationships, father daughter in particular. And I know you've got a very good relationship with your daughter, Grace, and because My dad's died recently, very, very suddenly and this is the last song that I ever sent to him and it was Namakita Pat, it's her version of it, it's out on a new album later this year, it is the most, honestly, it's almost as good as Jack Braille And Stacey will know for me to say that it's quite a thing. But anyway, so I sent her the I sent her this poem that my mum had left for us. And I I can recite it to you now. It's very, very short. It just said, farewell my family. My life has passed. I loved you all to the very last. Weep not for me, but courage take. Love each other for my sake. For those you love, don't go away, they walk beside you every day. And I whenever I feel Sort of I I I feel that quite often. I I feel my people I've missed, not just my parents and my brothers, but other people that I've lost. If I'm in a political situation, I will sometimes I literally will talk to Philip Gould, and I will go for a walk, and I will talk to him. So I think these are all ways of dealing with, The with grief. Because I don't think grief is a thing that just goes within days or weeks. I think it stays with you. Oh, thank you. Well, to cheer us up on a slightly On a different different note, but I thought that was wonderful, Esther. Catherine Adams, always have good book recommendations. I'm off to Israel soon. So and, Alastair, book recommendations on Palestine? Right. If I would recommend 1 book going to Israel, I'd say My Promised Land by Avi Shritt. Very good. Okay. I'm gonna go with Raja Shehadeh's Palestinian walks. Mhmm. And also encourage somebody going to that region to Think beyond just the current situation of Israel Palestine into the older history. So there's an amazing book by Peter Brown called The Body in Society, which is about sexual renunciation and early Christianity a lot in that region of the world. Maybe read a bit about the Ottomans. If you want a fun Ottoman book, there's a great murder mystery by Orhan Pamuk With a 16th century detective, which gets you into the world of the Ottoman Empire, and, of course, Palestine is part of the Ottoman Empire. And then I'd maybe encourage you to read Writers who aren't necessarily writing about Israel Palestine Mhmm. But are writers based in Israel and Palestine. So, You know, obviously, on the Palestinian side, you may want to read Edward Said's Orientalism. But on the Israeli side, you know, we've talked a lot about Yuval Noah Harari who lives In Israel, teach the university there, and his books are definitely worth reading, Homo Deus, etcetera. Very good, very good. I am currently reading, the proofs of a book by Sadiq Khan called Breathe, Tackling the Climate Emergency, and that's actually for a political politician book, it's actually rather well written and and interesting. He's sort of taken his own experience of developing, asthma as an adult into what he's now trying to do to change politics and policies on the climate. And you talked about your dad there, Aure. Yep. The other book I really I'm gonna hold it up for you. You can see it even if the If the listeners can't Yeah. This is the French translation of a book, a copy of which I have got for you. Oh my goodness. Because it's called Hanoi after the war. Uh-huh. And it's a book of pictures by a guy called John Ramsden, Who is one of our neighbors out in France. And John Ramsden followed in your father's footsteps in Vietnam. Oh. And he was he was deputy head of mission, probably about 20 years after your dad. And when we posted The obituary to your dad when you talked about him in a previous episode, he said that it brought back So many Webberies of his time doing the same job Oh. In Vietnam, basically going and telling the Americans that this wasn't going very well and they needed to think about A new strategy. So he's given he's he's he's got one for me and one for you. Good. Oh, well That's, that's lovely. Fabulous pictures. And I wanna finish with a thanks to you because Myself, Shashana, my wife, and my mother, who you know, Sally, have been watching Only Murders in the Building, the Steve Martin comedy that you recommended. What do you think? I think it's brilliant. It's absolutely brilliant. They're much better podcasters than us. We should start recording in closets. I like the fact that Steve Martin's made to record in a really hot closet. Do you see do you see they are better podcast than us? They probably spent I think they spend more time talking to each other about their podcast. As that's for sure. Like, 7 days a week. It is quite funny, though, isn't it? That's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Alright. Thank you, Alastair. All the best.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to the Restless Politics Question Time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. And, Alastair, look, we've got a lot of lovely stuff to get going on. And there's a lovely question from Richie Crichton on congressman Santos from the United States, which I'd love to get on to. But the first question I'd like to hit you with is about global ownership of British Football before we get on to gritty American politics. Two questions from Andrew.\n\nIs it naive to think we can prevent our most venerable football clubs from becoming vehicles For vampiric capitalists and dubious potentates, are we forced to accept that the people's game could be chiseled away from us like our public utilities, a consequence of open market. So would you tell us a little bit about what's going on in football?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, well, well, I'm I'm imagining the question is driven. And we had quite a few on this. But by the the bid that is in well, 2 bids that are in to buy Manchester United, one of the biggest football brands in the world. And\n\nSpeaker 1: and who who owned them before? So tell us a little bit about\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, the Glazers. The this American, business family, the Glazers, who are There's a slogan amongst Manchester United fans, love United, hate the Glazers.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, dear. That's a bit unfortunate. And how long have they owned it for? They've had it for years.\n\nSpeaker 0: Basically, they took the club over. There's a lot of sort of, controversy about the the means by which they did it by Basically, buying the club with the club's own money as it were. And since then, the fans have run a sort of never ending campaign to try and get them out of the club. Including at one point, there was a point in the in this story when the the predominant color on the terrace was yellow and green, which was the color of the team that Preceded Manchester United.\n\nSpeaker 1: But but but, sorry, just for those of you who don't understand, so Ferguson was around from 86 to 2013 or something, Some incredible kind of period. Is that right? Alex Ferguson managing Manchester United.\n\nSpeaker 0: He was there for a long time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. And somewhere in the middle of that period, the Glazers came in aboard. But Yeah. Actually, it was quite successful under them.\n\nRight? I mean, it it was a good period for the club.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But how much was that to do with what was already there and and and whether that is to do. But I think that the what the fans don't like about the club is they feel that it's been taken away from them. They don't feel the same relationship with the club that they had. The they see the Glazers as kind of almost almost like absent landlords.\n\nThe the investment hasn't been there. Now I know that sounds ridiculous because of the Lots of money that they pay for players and that they salaries and so forth. But Manchester United have kind of fallen.\n\nSpeaker 1: Is the same true with Chelsea and Abramovich? I mean, is this just a general Facts whenever you get bought by a foreign owner?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'll tell you what's interesting. If you go through or very, very quickly go through all the clubs in the Premier League, Arsenal, American, Aston Villa, American, Bournemouth, America, Brentford, British, Matthew Benham, a gambler, Brian and Hovalvian, Tony Bloom, Ditto, Chelsea, now American, was Russian. Crystal Palace, Steve Parish is is still a big factor there, but he own he's only now got 10%. The rest are all American. Everton Egyptian, Fulham American, Leeds Italian and American, Leicester Thailand, Liverpool American, Manchester City, Abu Dhabi, America and China.\n\nChina's only 1%, mind you. Manchester United, the Glazers. Newcastle United, Saudi. Nottingham Forest, Greece. Southampton, British, and Switzerland, Tottenham, England, West Ham United, Wales, Welsh, David Sullivan, and Czech, And Wolverhampton Wanderers' China.\n\nWoah. So to answer the question, is the game be chiseled away from us like our public utilities? It's certainly come, a massive global industry.\n\nSpeaker 1: And just quick on that because you're you know a lot about Germany. My understanding is that, traditionally, in Germany, the clubs were Owned by the fans. And is that not true even for huge clubs like Barcelona that they're controlled by the fans?\n\nSpeaker 0: The fans in Barcelona do have a lot more say. They, for example, elect the president.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: But the club ownership in Germany is driven by this thing called the 51% rule. So the fans do have A stake in the running of the club. And I'm a big fan of German football for lots of reasons, but one of them is that I think that has improved the quality of the clubs. I think it improves the relationship with the fans, and it's also helped to keep prices down as well.\n\nSpeaker 1: And it's also meant that they've concentrated much more on youth development, is that right, in Germany?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But I think look. Most of our clubs do Do pretty you know, they've got pretty good academies and and all that stuff. But I just think what we're seeing now with with football. So the 2 people are now going for Manchester United.\n\n1st guy is Jim Ratcliffe, who is a billionaire. He he already runs the team INEOS in cycling. He's He runs he owns a nice football club, and the other guy is Sheikh Yassim bin Hamad Al Thani, son of an ex Qatari prime minister. And, of course, that's leading to because, you know, I don't think the sort of money that you're gonna be talking about to buy Manchester United is a lot of money. We're talking well into the billions.\n\nAnd, of course, the ICsaris already own Paris Saint Germain.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: There's still this talk around the place, Despite Gary Neville's brilliant protestations against it of a European Super League\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: That appears to be the direction of travel that a lot of the big clubs want to go in.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Tell us a little bit about that. The idea there is that you put Barcelona, Madrid into a a Super League with Manchester United.\n\nSpeaker 0: With Manchester United, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint Germain, the Italian clubs, Juventus, I guess. And the other thing that really sort of upset a lot of football fans, was the idea that a bit like the American, the NFL, it would be, you know, you'd be in, and then you'd you'd be in the club. Basically, you'd buy your way in. So anyway, I think it it does underline the the the sheer I can remember way, way, way back When Rupert Murdoch tried to buy Manchester United, one of his companies tried to buy Manchester United. And, of course, at the time, he was also the owner of, You know, the main TV company covering live Premier League football.\n\nAnd there was an obvious sort of, you know, potential conflict there. But do you know what? I think I'm right in saying that I don't think anybody has ever been stopped from owning a football club on the fit and proper person test. Where, Andrew, the questioner is onto something. Is this thing about I think it's almost like the the football and the business of football, like a lot of businesses, has kinda become Too big to fail, and it's become such an important part of our culture, of our image abroad, and so forth.\n\nNow Tracy Crouch\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Who was my colleague? Yep. Enter parliament with me in 2010. Yep.\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. Well, I'm about to say something. I don't say often. She's a Tory MP and I really like her.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. She's she's great, isn't she?\n\nSpeaker 0: And she she did this review, the fan led football review. And Gary Neville, who knows his stuff, He certainly knows a lot more about football than I do. And he said he thought it was a really, really good piece of work. And one of the things that was being proposed is this idea of a football regulator.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now Johnson sort of I can't remember what he did with it. Nothing. Trust wasn't there long enough. And I don't know at this stage whether Rishi Sunak is taking and interest. But I think that there's a I think there is a sense amongst a lot of football fans that football is becoming very, very distant from them.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and part of that is ticket precedent. I mean, so why didn't you as Labour, why don't you and the future Labour government bring in a rule like this German fifty plus one rule where the commercial people can't own more than 49%, and the fans and the clubs Keep control and keep the ticket prices down, keep the attendance up?\n\nSpeaker 0: You could do that. You could do that. I think you'd face a hell of a lot of opposition from within the industry, but I think you'd have a lot of support from that within the the football the broader football community. We didn't do it because I think it I I don't think that I don't think we were there. I think it was the It was the start of this process.\n\nI mean, I'm I I I do remember when Abramovich bought Chelsea. I remember the the headline, you know, the obvious one, Chelski, that was sort of all over the papers. But it was such a big thing. But now it's kinda commonplace when I went through that list. And by the way, when you go down into the championship and below, You'll see an awful lot of non British owners are there as well, including at Burnley.\n\nWe've got American owners now, and that's because British football is such a big global industry.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Very good. Well, Alastair, I'm very grateful we got you on that because it is something you know an enormous amount about that I know nothing about. And\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, believe me, there will still be lots of people coming on saying, god, he was talking rubbish. All we should have said was this because it's one of those Sundays that does tend to provoke.\n\nSpeaker 1: Thank goodness I get to talk about the Highlands of Central Afghanistan I'm gonna have fewer people going\n\nSpeaker 0: I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you a tough one. If you're gonna give me a tough one, I'm gonna give you a tough one. Nick Simpson, why do you guys believe That the latest front on the conspiracy culture wars is the 15 minute city idea of having shops and services near your home. It seems odd that this is what's been targeted. Is this just random chance, or are there forces that are threatened by this concept?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's amazing, isn't it? So 15 minute city was something I was trying to run on when I was running to be Yeah. An independent to be mayor of London. Something that Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, has done a great job. The idea of 15 minute city is that everything should be within 15 minutes' walk or at most cycle ride from where you are, and it's a lovely idea.\n\nI think of new urbanism, mixed use, and it's something we badly need in London. I mean, I I remember meeting Afghan friends up in North London, and, You know, I thought we'll go and have a cup of tea, which would be a normal thing to do in Afghanistan. We had to walk 25 minutes to a Sainsbury's to get a cup of tea, and I realized that there was a complete absence of the sort of dense community structures in life which make life worth living in a city in many, many parts of London. So, anyway, in Oxford, they're trying to Pushed ahead. They're also trying to put restrictions on people driving their cars into Central Oxford.\n\nAnd people have decided in a massive Sort of global outcry against this, including this slightly creepy figure, Jordan Peterson, who's this right wing Canadian Social media advocate that this is an attempt to lock people in their homes as part of a world government's attempt, which began with COVID, To try to take control of our lives and stop us visiting our mums.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yes. The World Economic Forum. They they've come up with this dastardly plan. I mean, how do it it does seem to be incredible these these how these conspiracy theories develop and and the things that get targeted. Farage was at it.\n\nThere was a Tory MP in the comments the other day talking about it.\n\nSpeaker 1: Nick Fletcher. Richard Sterling's asked about this thing, international socialist conspiracy. So it's very interesting. So restrictions on cars in Europe are increasingly being seen as socialist. Now that that's, again, I think part of us endlessly just sort of picking up from the United States where there's a sort of strong association of Liberals being the people who are stopping you getting wanting to have some big gas guzzler.\n\nNo. It's extraordinary. And the only thing that I suppose you might say, which people pointed out to me in London, which is true, is that sometimes the restrictions on car use, So restrictions on car use in Outer London can have a disproportionate impact on people on low incomes with older cars that have to pay more Because their cars don't qualify for exemptions, and they need their cars to get to work, and that it is easier for people living in sort of zone 2 in London To to be high high and mighty about not using cars.\n\nSpeaker 0: As I understand it, the Oxford thing, where some of these counselors and officials are getting all sorts of abuse and people from around the world sort of getting on at them and saying you're part of, you know, some terrible globalist international plot. We were talking on the main podcast about biodiversity and about the climate crisis. You know, for councils to try to do something to get more people to walk and cycle is not a bad thing, and to slow down in cities as you don't knock as many kids over.\n\nSpeaker 1: Above all for air pollution, so we're still in a world in which At least 26,000, but maybe 50,000 people a year in Britain are dying prematurely because of air pollution, With a lot of that coming out of the tail end of vehicles. So stopping people doing it is good particularly for our children, for the elderly. But But conspiracy theories I mean, I don't know whether you've been on the receiving end of them. My big one, I I went to I was invited to Bilderberg conference. And as soon as this came out, There was questions in the House of Commons where, you know, Ken Clark had to defend at the dispatch box Rory Stewart's attendance at Bilderberg Conference.\n\nAnd some of my constituents who are more on the kind of BNP UKIP end started saying that this meant that I was a a lizard king, And I couldn't quite work out whether I'd sort of been a lizard before I was invited to Build A Boat Conference or whether I'd sort of grown a tail after my attendance.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think you have to be a lizard to qualify.\n\nSpeaker 1: To qualify in the 1st place. Do you do you ever get hit by conspiracy theories?\n\nSpeaker 0: I don't know if it's a conspiracy. I don't think so.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, oh, I Probably. Sort of quickly sorry. I've realized people don't know what the conference is. So the conference conference is a a conference which has been going for a number of years. Small conference invites a lot of fancy people, politicians, business leaders, and has the kind of earnest conversations you have in every conference around the world.\n\nI mean, You talk about the state of the world. You scratch your head about China. You talk about Taiwan, and you get some gloomy economists talking about inflation.\n\nSpeaker 0: What do you think it says about people's relationship with the world though that they So many people seem to want these they want to own these conspiracy theories. I suppose the one I get a little bit is from the The Corbynist left sometimes accuse me of having deliberately tried to help the Tories win an election. Is that a conspiracy theory, or is that just a sort of insult? I don't know.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Here we are. I'm gonna get some quicker questions going. Here's a question for you. Live tweets from the underground.\n\nWhat do you make of Keir Starmer banning Corbyn from standing as a Labour MP And telling people who supported him to leave the party. That's what Boris Johnson did to me.\n\nSpeaker 0: It is. And I I think it's what really soon I should do to Boris Johnson. Look. Keir Starmer did a speech last week where he set out how far he thought the Labour Party had changed since Jeremy Corbyn, the whole kind of Story of antisemitism. The Labour Party has now been sort of given a pretty clean bill of health because of the changes that have been made.\n\nAnd I think the sense is that Jeremy Corbyn Still doesn't really get it on that front. I've actually just been reading David Bedell's book, Jews Don't Count, which is, As you'd expect from David Badell, very funny in parts, but it's also incredibly serious. And it does make you think about this sort of he talks about his hierarchy of racism and that Antisemitism is is almost like sort of the the racism that progressives don't think is as bad as the others. And so I think Keir's basically saying, You know, Jeremy Corbyn, whatever his strengths, whatever, you know, good he's done for in the past, the You know, he he the way he handled that and the way that he allowed the anti Semitism crisis to develop within the party means that he shouldn't stand as a candidate.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there we are. Okay. I mean, I'm obviously depressed about it because I don't like being chucked out myself. I think these things should be big, big, tents, And they shouldn't I think it's a a mistake in British politics to make these groups too narrow, and I think it's particularly brutal to do it to someone who's been that Senior. And that's like kicking out Ken Clarke.\n\nSo why don't we take a quick break and then come back and do rattle through some questions after the break, Welcome back to Restless Politics. One thing quickly, just to thank All of you who've signed up for the rest of this politics newsletter, I hope you're enjoying it.

Ask the questions.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now we weren't getting through quickly enough, so let's try this one. What, Tyler, can Alastair admit to any upsides of being out of the EU? I'm struggling on that one. So that was very, very quick. Doubt with.\n\nDone. Here's one for you. MP's expenses, Matthew Wilcox. Yep. X MP's expenses often written about as if comparable to normal expenses that an office employee might submit.\n\nIs this a false equivalence? Can you explain why 1,000 in expenses might actually be legitimate in value?\n\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Let me explain that. So There's something actually pretty outrageous there. You often see, and I found this as an MP, so and so spent a £160,000 on their expenses. When you look through those items, you'll discover that that almost all of that will be the cost of their constituency office.\n\nSo those will be the people who are working very hard and are processing in case my constituency office and other people are busy. I think you got Something like 25,000 emails and letters a year, all of which needed to be replied to, constituency events organized. It's a serious business. And, actually, MPs have much, much smaller staffs than their US equivalents would have. So these aren't, as you might imagine, people sort of Buying champagne on the company.\n\nThese are people using the money to run the basic operations of their life. And it's also true that MPs who are in Northern constituencies, you know, people who are up in Scotland coming down to London, need to spend the night in London, and it's very weird for the public to say this is outrageous. Now there were definitely abuses in the past, Definite definite abuse in the past, and there may still be MPs fiddling their expenses now. But the vast majority of MPs are very, very careful, and a lot of the stuff is Just Twitter\n\nSpeaker 0: bait. Mhmm. Nicola Bully case. This is a question from Felix Trimboss, and we had quite a few about this. I wonder if you might briefly discuss the standards of reporting around the appearance of Nicola Bully, the subsequent discovery by walkers.\n\nThe family particularly criticized press intrusion. However, I noticed The mail online omitted those sentences from the statement when they published the statement in full, in quotes, and focus their coverage on alleged failings by the police. Do you think the media whipped up criticism and the police to draw attention away from the way they have stoked the unwelcome social media speculation, or will news organizations always be criticized for their handling sort of story. And, of course, we should also add that 2 of the TV 2 of the broadcasters, ITV and Sky, were also named as having been overly in intrusive.\n\nSpeaker 1: So tell us a bit about this because well, firstly, tell us a bit about Nicol Bolle, and then you you were a journalist. Right? So you were right in the heart of The the bad old days, 19 eighties, when people were accused of a lot of this, weren't they?\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think, I mean, the the it was sort of pre that era was pre mobile phones and all the hacking and all that and stuff. But, certainly, I think there was a lot of journalism through time is often pushed right at the edges. But I think when you've been through The whole thing of the Leveson inquiry, Milly Dowler's death, and the which is what led to the Leveson inquiry ultimately, and the press Constantly saying that, you know, they will get their own house in order. But it does seem to be, in this case, 2 things coming together.\n\nSo Niccolabulli goes missing. It becomes a sort of major media story. And the press, According to the family and according to the police who've been speaking on their behalf, overstepped them up repeatedly, both in terms of misrepresenting people, in terms intrusions from their privacy and and now on their grief and so forth. And so, you know, there was an interesting debate on the radio this morning where People were talking about whether the press will ever, agree to any kind of genuine regulation. IPSO, is the latest manifestation of the press complaints commission.\n\nThey've always been, in my view, bodies of the press, for the press, by the press. And I think that's what we have. And but I think it's typical that newspapers would take out. So they're they're happy to say ITV and Sky have been criticized. They're happy to say that the police have been criticized.\n\nBut criticism of themselves just sort of finds its way nicely to the spike.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Now World Bank present replacement, The Dogfather. I like that name, The Dogfather. Who'd be the best place to replace the head of the World Bank, David Malpass?\n\nSpeaker 0: Oh, it's gotta be The Dogfather. It's gotta\n\nSpeaker 1: be the dog father himself. Very good.\n\nSpeaker 0: Kindly can the dog father not do it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Dog father, please.\n\nSpeaker 0: And what about what about what about Gordon? What about Gordon?\n\nSpeaker 1: Could be Gordon. Could be Gordon. That's very good. I'm afraid it's gonna be an American. Could be Larry Summers.\n\nLarry Summers putting his glasses up the job.\n\nSpeaker 0: Does it have to be an American? The the the Americans\n\nSpeaker 1: But but it's an American appointment. It would be very odd for them not to appoint an American. They never done Never not had an American\n\nSpeaker 0: The Americans like Gordon?\n\nSpeaker 1: They like Gordon.\n\nSpeaker 0: Now here's one, Rory. Brian Keating. Yep. Please, he says, please can you discuss the new voter ID rules? And I think we should because I'm very worried about these.\n\nI I think that this\n\nSpeaker 1: You you've you've done a bit of it, haven't you? So just just I'll do a little explainer, and then you'll give your Yeah. Comments. So The government's introducing new voter ID rules, and there's not much evidence really of voter fraud at all in Britain. I'm I'm sorry.\n\nNot not evidence of that kind of fraud of People turning up and voting when they're not supposed to vote. There's been other types of voter fraud. In fact, there's been a terrible case with an ex Labour mayor in Tower Hamlets who got up to all kinds of horrible business during elections, but Not that kind of effort. The government's now pushing for much, much tighter ID, and the criticism of it is that this is ID that older people tend to have. And Unless you're a younger person with a driving license or a passport, it's gonna become more difficult for you to vote.\n\nSo I think you asked to see this as a kind of suppression of younger voters.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think it could be because, look, this is this is a a new law that's being brought in without a problem to address. I mean, the The problem, as you say, is is is next to non existent. And now you've got the electoral administrators saying that they're really worried That they will not be able to bring this in time for the May 2023 elections, which is when it's due to begin with us. We're we're talking a few weeks' time. And most people don't know this is happening.\n\nMost people will just turn up as they normally have. Doubtless the government will pay for a few adverts to go on the television, but, You know, in the end, so what? I just I can't see the reason why they're doing this, why they're devoting so much parliamentary time to it, So much political capital being used on it unless it's sort of to get the right people to vote and the wrong people not to vote.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's odd, isn't it? Or some strange culture war that I can't quite get my head around. Thoughts on national service. So this relates to the interview with David Lammy, John Arthross, what are your opinions on national service or progressive national service focused on neglected jobs such as fruit picking, social care, rewilding, run the military?\n\nI was very much in favor of this. When I was running to be leader of the conservative party, I tried to push for a citizens national service. The idea was very, very much not A military type of service, but to go for a commitment people doing this form of social service. Mhmm. What what do you think about it?\n\nSpeaker 0: No. I'd be in favor of that. I think military service less so. Although I do think, by the way, we're gonna have to there's gonna have to be a major sort of strategic review right across the NATO countries given what's going on in in Ukraine. But I wouldn't be in favor of military service.\n\nBut I I also think there's a very interesting paradox, Which I came across when I was doing the research for this book I've written, which is that young people in general are very, very socially conscious. Okay? And yet, they are less civically engaged than when you and I were growing up. And that's, you know, research that shows that fewer than a third of people now aged aged to 18 to 24 Say that they would be willing to work together with others on something to improve my neighborhood. And that is well, well, well down on this on the the the same question.\n\nIt's almost halved.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there's also this terrifying statistics, I think. You you would have seen that a very large number of young people say that a good military government would be better than the current democracy in Britain.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. So maybe maybe they want they want the military kind of national service, and we want the The volunteering and doing good things kind of national service.\n\nSpeaker 1: Congressman Santos, Richie Crichton, would you like to discuss the current with George Santos in the US. Any comparison to politicians telling fibs about their backgrounds in the UK? So, I mean, people who haven't been following this, which I guess many, many people will have done, but It is the most staggering story. Congressman Santos is a Republican congressman who claimed to work for Goldman Sachs, didn't, claimed to be Jewish and descended from holocaust survivors, wasn't. Claimed to go on to an elite college, which he didn't do.\n\nClaimed to run a charity, which didn't exist. Claimed to know victims of a nightclub shooting, which he didn't. His mother, he claims, died twice, once in 911, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So, and yet, somehow, the Republicans are still gathering around him, although there was a great standoff with Mitch Romney Yeah. Trying to get him to move to back.\n\nAny thoughts on Santos? Any thoughts on US, UK equivalents?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, look, I know it's of a different order when you go through them like that, But I think if you were to look at the life story and the life and times of Alexander Boris D'Pfeffer Johnson, there's a guy who doesn't mind telling big fat lies, and he thinks he can be prime minister again.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's that's true. Different type of lie though, isn't it? Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you know the one that I've spotted a lot in recent years in politics. It's this this thing about people exaggerating their their academic qualifications and and plagiarizing theses. Quite a lot of politicians seem to get dull on\n\nSpeaker 1: And Germans, particularly. It's a big deal in Germany, isn't it? I think there've been 3 or 4 German politicians That's a good one.\n\nSpeaker 0: AI AI is going to obviously make that even more prevalent. Look, George Santos is a ridiculous character. He's truly ridiculous, and and there's been some wonderful protests in his, in his district to people basically saying, like, you know, you're just so embarrassing, you books. I you cannot be our representative. But he just sort of He just smiles benignly and carries on and goes and makes up more stories.\n\nBut I guess it's a logical extension of Trump's alternative facts, isn't it? Invent your own story. Make your own story.\n\nSpeaker 1: It's just so extraordinary. I love the mother died twice, once in 911.\n\nSpeaker 0: Poor mom. How does she feel? Here's what we read. George Capell, what did Rory and Alastair think about the treatment of the BBC in India after the documentary on Modi? Have they seen the documentary?\n\nNo, not in my case. What do they think about religious division and Hindu nationalism in India India more generally? How should the UK respond to this? And this is I I don't know if you've seen this, but the the BBC headquarters were raided. Audience were raided.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. On trumped up tax charges. Yeah. Which relates I mean, we were talking about Modi and populism. I mean, it's a very, very difficult issue.\n\nIt is definitely a populist government. Modi has been associated with anti Muslim rhetoric since these horrifying riots when he was Running Gujarat, we talked about that too. There are Hindu nationalist militia who do these very, very sinister proto fascist parades in the street, And it's something that I think we need to call out much more. Mhmm. But it's also something which is very tense In British politics, I mean, Modi, when he comes over to Europe, does these huge rallies, France, Britain, where enormous numbers of people turn up.\n\nMany friends of mine who are Indians are cautious about my openly criticizing and calling out Modi for what he does, And I think it's horrifying, and I think the BBC documentary was careful and justified, and this is very unfair.\n\nSpeaker 0: I did did I didn't see if anybody from the government Spoke up to the BBC. I didn't I didn't notice if they did or they didn't.\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I didn't see that either.\n\nSpeaker 0: I think the fact that neither of us noticed it suggested they\n\nSpeaker 1: Maybe not being as well, they I think But there is a real issue around this because, there's a big competition amongst both political parties of courting British Asian votes Much of the British Asian community remains very committed towards Modi, and I think that may be why we haven't heard much criticism.\n\nSpeaker 0: And you've got the government Still hopeful of trying to get some sort of trade deal at some point. Now here's one Rory, very personal to all of us, but I think it's a very nice question. James Counter, How have you learned to deal with the loss of someone close to you? I know this is mental health, not politics question, but you bridge that gap occasionally.\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'll start 1st. And then, Hanover, gee, so my my father died, who I was very, very close to. He died at the age of 92. I was with him when he died, And, actually, I tried to resuscitate him and and didn't didn't succeed.\n\nSo I was with him when he was alive, and I Was the with him for his last words and then with him as as he died. I I don't know whether there's any Strong answer to that. I mean, I felt with my father that I was very, very lucky that I had a very good relationship with him and that we'd spent a lot of time together talking. And, therefore, In a way, I didn't feel so much that there was anything that we were we were missing that had been undone. But but, Alistair, over over to you, it's something you thought about much more than me.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I'm a great believer in crime. I think, actually, letting it all out when you feel like letting it out, and sometimes in the strangest of circumstances. My sister was Telling me the other day that we both we've lost both of our brothers. And, she bumped into the the doctor that was looking after 1 of our brothers when he was When he was ill and she just bumped into him outside the cafe and she just saw him and just burst into tears, and it was obviously that's A form of grief, and I'm a great believer in that. I think if you feel like crying, you should cry.\n\nI think the second thing I would say is I'd honestly, Rory, I think listening to music When you're feeling sad is, is a great thing to do, even if, again, that makes you you cry. I think writing is very good for grief. I think sometimes writing letters to the person that you miss, is a good thing to do, even though you know it's not going to go anywhere. And I think the other thing, when my when my mom died, she and as you know, I was in Jordan where you live, and she died, and while she was dead by the time I got And we found in in her papers this poem that she wanted us to read at the funeral. And I now Send this to anybody I hear of in in including this week.\n\nI had an extraordinary situation this year. I think I told you before about a musician called Stacy Kent, Who I came across about a year ago in France. I just heard her in the background in a restaurant, and I tweeted about this incredible voice I've just come across. Oh, she's become quite friendly, and I'm going to see her in, when she's in Ronnie Scott's in April. And, Anyway, I sent her a message randomly about Next to Nothing, when I was in Switzerland.\n\nOh, that's right. I'd heard her music in a lift in a hotel. You won't believe I've just heard in a lift. And she sent me a version which she has just recorded of Namakita Pa by Jack Brell, who is my favorite musician of all time. And she said it was nice to get your message out the blue.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about Parent and child relationships, father daughter in particular. And I know you've got a very good relationship with your daughter, Grace, and because My dad's died recently, very, very suddenly and this is the last song that I ever sent to him and it was Namakita Pat, it's her version of it, it's out on a new album later this year, it is the most, honestly, it's almost as good as Jack Braille And Stacey will know for me to say that it's quite a thing. But anyway, so I sent her the I sent her this poem that my mum had left for us. And I I can recite it to you now. It's very, very short.\n\nIt just said, farewell my family. My life has passed. I loved you all to the very last. Weep not for me, but courage take. Love each other for my sake.\n\nFor those you love, don't go away, they walk beside you every day. And I whenever I feel Sort of I I I feel that quite often. I I feel my people I've missed, not just my parents and my brothers, but other people that I've lost. If I'm in a political situation, I will sometimes I literally will talk to Philip Gould, and I will go for a walk, and I will talk to him. So I think these are all ways of dealing with, The with grief.\n\nBecause I don't think grief is a thing that just goes within days or weeks. I think it stays with you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh, thank you. Well, to cheer us up on a slightly On a different different note, but I thought that was wonderful, Esther. Catherine Adams, always have good book recommendations. I'm off to Israel soon. So and, Alastair, book recommendations on Palestine?\n\nSpeaker 0: Right. If I would recommend 1 book going to Israel, I'd say My Promised Land by Avi Shritt.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. I'm gonna go with Raja Shehadeh's Palestinian walks.\n\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\n\nSpeaker 1: And also encourage somebody going to that region to Think beyond just the current situation of Israel Palestine into the older history. So there's an amazing book by Peter Brown called The Body in Society, which is about sexual renunciation and early Christianity a lot in that region of the world. Maybe read a bit about the Ottomans. If you want a fun Ottoman book, there's a great murder mystery by Orhan Pamuk With a 16th century detective, which gets you into the world of the Ottoman Empire, and, of course, Palestine is part of the Ottoman Empire. And then I'd maybe encourage you to read Writers who aren't necessarily writing about Israel Palestine Mhmm.\n\nBut are writers based in Israel and Palestine. So, You know, obviously, on the Palestinian side, you may want to read Edward Said's Orientalism. But on the Israeli side, you know, we've talked a lot about Yuval Noah Harari who lives In Israel, teach the university there, and his books are definitely worth reading, Homo Deus, etcetera.\n\nSpeaker 0: Very good, very good. I am currently reading, the proofs of a book by Sadiq Khan called Breathe, Tackling the Climate Emergency, and that's actually for a political politician book, it's actually rather well written and and interesting. He's sort of taken his own experience of developing, asthma as an adult into what he's now trying to do to change politics and policies on the climate. And you talked about your dad there, Aure.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yep. The other book\n\nSpeaker 0: I really I'm gonna hold it up for you. You can see it even if the If the listeners can't\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 0: This is the French translation of a book, a copy of which I have got for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh my goodness.\n\nSpeaker 0: Because it's called Hanoi after the war. Uh-huh. And it's a book of pictures by a guy called John Ramsden, Who is one of our neighbors out in France. And John Ramsden followed in your father's footsteps in Vietnam. Oh.\n\nAnd he was he was deputy head of mission, probably about 20 years after your dad. And when we posted The obituary to your dad when you talked about him in a previous episode, he said that it brought back So many Webberies of his time doing the same job\n\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\n\nSpeaker 0: In Vietnam, basically going and telling the Americans that this wasn't going very well and they needed to think about A new strategy. So he's given he's he's he's got one for me and one for you.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. Oh, well That's, that's lovely.\n\nSpeaker 0: Fabulous pictures.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I wanna finish with a thanks to you because Myself, Shashana, my wife, and my mother, who you know, Sally, have been watching Only Murders in the Building, the Steve Martin comedy that you recommended.\n\nSpeaker 0: What do you think?\n\nSpeaker 1: I think it's brilliant. It's absolutely brilliant. They're much better podcasters than us. We should start recording in closets. I like the fact that Steve Martin's made to record in a really hot closet.\n\nSpeaker 0: Do you see do you see they are better podcast than us? They probably spent I think they spend more time talking to each other about their podcast. As that's for sure. Like, 7 days a week. It is quite funny, though, isn't it?\n\nSpeaker 1: That's beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Alright. Thank you, Alastair.\n\nSpeaker 0: All the best.",
