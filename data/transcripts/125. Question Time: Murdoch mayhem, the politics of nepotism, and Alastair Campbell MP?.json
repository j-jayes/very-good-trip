Welcome to the Restless Politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alastair Campbell. And, Rory, we should reward somebody by the name of Simon Beale, because he has been putting this question in week after week after week after week. And he hasn't given up. And in my new book, which I can now show you, Roy, there is my new book. And I've invented a word, which is perseverance. Perseverance is the combination of perseverance and resilience. So this guy, Simon, has had the setback of not having his question answered. But he's persevered, and, therefore, he's a very persevering character. And his question is quite a tough one. What role does nepotism play in public life? Have you ever been the beneficiary of it and or provided it? Well, I think in certainly in political life, there's there's much less, I think, than people outside think. There are I mean, nepotism, of course, As everyone knows, is about, favouring your own family, generally your own kids. Mhmm. And What actually has changed in British politics is that it was a very, very strong factor, obviously, in the 19th century. People like Winston Churchill, you know, his father had been chancellor, His grandfather had been in parliament, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Nowadays, there are MPs who have parents in parliament on both sides of the house, the Labour MPs who have, And in fact, the Labour MP who's both whose parents were in the house and who I think is is married to a member of parliament. Ah, John Cryer. Son of Anne Cryer and Bob Cryer, both former Labour MPs, and, of course, he's married to Ellie Reeves, who's the Labour MP for Lewisham West and whose sister is Rachel Reeves, the current shadow chancer of the Checkout. How about that? Anyway, in on the conservative side, the people who had parents who were, in the house commons were people like Nicholas Soames, Who, of course, was was Churchill's grandson, Dominic Grieve? Andrew Mitchell? Richard Bennion, Andrew Mitchell. Yep. And many of these people Actually, we're more on the left of the party. They were in something called the 1 nation dining club with me. And in a sense, it seemed that the fact that they were children of MPs gave them a sort of, I think a sort of slightly more left of center type of conservatism, less strident. I mean, Dominic Raab, who we've been talking about a great deal, his dad, Peter, Came from Czech Republic at the age of 6 on a Kindertransport, became a food manager at M&S, died when Dom was 12, So definitely, you know, an example of a very different route, which is is true of many many MPs. I get I guess I guess what Simon means by the question in relation And where maybe it is more apparent is is the you do see an awful lot of MPs who employ members of their family. Now I've I've spoken to MPs whose wives run their constituency office, and they say, actually, because they it means that they don't have to pay them, and they just kinda run it, and it's almost like it's part of the marriage. But And then and, you know, one of my one of my sons, Calum, he he worked for the Labour Party, for a while. And I actually think in a in a weird sort of way, it it can be worse for the for the for the child of the person who's well known. I I think Economies to get really fed up of people saying, well, that's Hamster Campbell's son. I think sometimes it can be harder if you're coming from what is perceived as nepotism. My daughter, Grace, who is, you know, is a comedian, she does a whole story about how which is a true story, by the way. She says that Once before a Manchester United man match, she was she was in the tunnel as the players were coming out, just because that's how nepotism works. So you You can I think I think that's the only place where I have it's actually been the fact that I can get invited to stuff? And because I'm feeling guilty about not being there when I should be, I I will phone the kids and say if I get you, you know, I can get you tickets for this, I can get you tickets for that. What do you think? I guess that's the sort of nepotism maybe I indulged in from time to time. Good. John, Having recently read Prelude to Power and enjoyed it very much, by the way, I was struck by Alice's wavering of whether to leave mainstream journalism and take the job of the Labour Party. It made me wonder if either Rory or Alastair have ever regretted a career move. Well, I regretted although I regretted the move when when I was a journalist, when I left the Daily Mirror to go and work for Eddie Shah's Today newspaper because I ended up having a nervous breakdown. Now I don't actually regret the overall experience, but I I I made I definitely made the wrong decision in doing that. And I do re I I do regret I regret not having stood as an MP myself. I do regret that. And I can explain why at every stage of the last 20 odd years or 30 odd years, whatever it is. I've not done it, and I can explain why I don't want to do it now. But I'd but that that is something that sort of nags away at me. What about you? Elsa, I want to strongly encourage you to run to be an MP in the next election. It's not far away. It's a good option. Anyway, Me, my biggest regret is I was running a charity in Afghanistan called Turquoise Mountain. We were restoring the center of the old city Kabul, which is Back in 2008, and I was absolutely loving it, working with a few 100 people, bringing water supplies, sanitation. We built a clinic, and I'd I'd built the whole thing from scratch. I'd started with 1 employee who was my driver, who I called my logistics manager, and we were really making a daily difference out on the Granaca Bowl, living there for 2, 3 years. And I then was approached by Harvard University to take a chair, professorial chair at Harvard University and be the director of a center, And I was flattered into doing it. I was just it just appealed to my ego. I was, like, yes, my That's what happened with me, but that's exactly what happened with me. I was flattered into believing that I had it in me to be the youngest news editor in Fleet Street. I was gonna be a news editor at 28, and it was a stupid decision. That's exactly right, me. So I thought this is amazing. I'm and Mike says old in that. I guess I was in my mid thirties, but full Harvard professor in my mid thirties. And, Actually, it didn't suit me at all. I would have been I much, much more enjoyed managing 2, 300 people on the ground in Afghanistan than I did trying to run an academic center. Jean Guy Cote, and he is, I'm guessing from that name, French Canadian, because his question is it and he posted an opinion poll suggesting that the Canadians seem reluctant to have Charles as king. And he says, do you think we could see a surge of republicanism in the Commonwealth in the next few years? So we posted a poll which showed a a a minority in favor of continuing the monarchy. I I think it's always a live issue. I think Republicanism of all sorts has been a live political issue for many, many years, and in some ways Britain is unusual still having a monarchy when most countries around the world Lawson, there was that famous joke of the the king of Egypt that in the end, there were gonna be only 5 kings left, The king of hearts, the king of clubs, the king of diamonds, the king of spades, and the king of England. But I think, And I I would say this, but I do think that King Charles has approached the job very well. I think, Prince William has a good reputation, and I think it's the the British monarchy is in quite a strong position. I I don't think there's anything at the moment which is, makes me think that people are able to push, but there are Commonwealth countries, of course. I mean, King Charles, when he was Prince Wales, one of the things he had to do last year, I think, was to go out to the Caribbean to visit a country that had decided they didn't want, the royal family anymore. I think he dealt with it very very well. You know, I don't think there's any sort of resentment there. I think he gave a good speech and engaged well and and left with very warm feelings, but One thing that's changed. I mean, the queen, remember, when she took over, went on a, I think, 7 months tour Yeah. Around all these different places. And I think Increasingly, the the Royal Family are maybe spend less time or have have maybe spent less time in other places, and I think that the pressures at distance are significant. I've just I've just found the poll while you were talking, and it's, 60% say they don't want Charles King. Right. It's quite high. Quite high. Yeah. Well but we've but, interestingly, these things go up and down, don't they? There was there was a moment in Australia where 20, 30 years ago where people really thought that that was gonna be the case, and then That seems to have turned around again. And I do think I've even Fiona, who's, you know, not exactly she's she's not on exactly the same page as you when it comes to Monica Horry. But she did say the other day. She's, god, could you imagine if somebody like Boris Johnson became an elected president. That's I think that's a good good line. I think it's it's I think that's right. I think you would hope that Tony Blair would become the elected president, but it could be Boris Johnson at which point you do worry about. Right. Next question from Discord. So to encourage people to go on Discord. Discord is our stream where debate's happening, and it's from somebody who calls themselves not a PhD. Honestly, I can't believe how many times the question of what happened, why isn't the US the harbinger of democracy anymore, can be asked on this podcast, and at no point do people wonder, oh, wait, maybe it never was. Maybe the country didn't magically go from sponsoring coup after coup in the sixties, seventies, and eighties to magically being the world force for democracy in the nineties. What do you make of that? I think that is a PhD. Calls himself not a p not a PhD. I think there's a great PhD question there. Now there's a very, very fair point in that partly because American, less so under Trump, but most American presidents, they talk so much about America as the leader of the free world, as the great democratic force. But, actually, there is there is something in that about their about their you know, we've talked about this a lot. We talked about it with Hillary Clinton. The the there's a mixed picture about America's America's role in the world. Good. And, also, this is another chance to plug my favorite book, Norman Mailer's Harlot's Ghost which is all about the CIA sponsoring these coups at exactly that period, and actually it's a very essentially making this point which not a PhD is making which Is, in a sense, the dark, troubling heart of American democracy is the weird connection between these these authoritarian special operations and its claim to be democracy. Here's a question for you. Veron, is Rupert Murdoch losing it, paying out 787,500,000 And firing Tucker Carlson, the jewel, and the Fox News crown. Is he losing it? Well, he's into his nineties. He's getting on, for sure. The Fox News settlement was must have been a very, very, very difficult or moment for him, but thoroughly deserved because Fox News' entire business model is founded on the exploitation of the 3 things that we talk about the whole time, terrorism, polarization, and post truth. Tucker Carlson is, you know, the questioner calls him the jewel in the Fox Fox News crown. Tucker Carlson is the is an absolute, populist, polarizing, post truth. And the reason why this became such a the the settlement with the the people who'd done the, Dominion Voting Machines. Dominion Voting Machines. Yeah. The reason that's been so damaging is because the the the reality was exposed between what they were saying on air, presenting themselves as arbiters of, you know, as they call it, fair and balanced news, bullshit, and at the same time, what they were privately thinking, which is, you know, this is absolute nonsense. Now Tucker Carlson became the The guy who was kind of leading that, on air as it were, but he wasn't the only one. And the truth is within that organization, they all knew that that's the game. By the way, it was the game from the word go. And it's why I think, although GB News is is seen as a bit of a joke by a lot of people, it's why we have to be very, very careful. Once you establish that it's normal for a country's main television channel, Fox News, which is watched more now than CNN, When it's accepted that lying and to feed your base, to to be to be to be nice to your viewers, to make them hear what they want to hear. That is very, very dangerous, and I think we've gotta be very, very careful we don't get the same thing here. You've interviewed Brian Cox on our leading podcast, and I believe, that in the settlement case with Jerry Hall, There was a clause put in saying that she couldn't give any information to the producers of succession. One of the interesting things, Also, I thought we're talking about earlier about, speaking truths to power, and I thought an interesting revelation on Murdoch came out of the end of the trial. So the end of the trial, the general counsel of FOX, which, you know, the senior lawyer, said to Murdoch that he'd done well. He said, I'm just gonna say it. They didn't lay a finger on you. And Murdoch has the self knowledge to disagree, And he pointed a finger at the lawyer who'd questioned him for dominion, and he said, I think he would strongly disagree with that. And Nelson, who was the man that Was doing the question, he said, indeed I do, and I thought that was interesting. With all his weaknesses in his nineties, he's not Totally blown up with his own legend. If if one of his staff is flattering him when he knows he's screwed up, he can still call it out in public. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I look. I I did, I don't I don't like doing those interviews. You know, you do I'm sure you get asked to do lots while we do interviews for broadcasters who are preparing obituaries. I I don't like doing them, but I did do one the other day for for Murdoch, and they're asking everybody at the end, Murdoch force for good or force for bad over his lifetime, and I'm afraid I was very much forced for bad. I think, ultimately, with Murdoch's, impact upon politics and media around the world. There were there were being amazing things that he's done. There's no doubt about that. But I think particularly the the the impact of Fox News on America and some of his journalistic habits here ultimately have been a force for bad. Yeah. We got a very nice message from a guy called Theo Davis Lewis, who, amongst other things, he's he's politically active down in Wales, but he he also writes for the The Spectator. And he has he wants us to talk about something which has also been raised by, I'm gonna have to say this in Welsh because the name of the person is clearly something in Welsh, but I don't know what it means. It's Fauch Sines. I hope that is sort of vaguely anyway, the question is this. There is so much huffing and puffing about the official adoption of the native Banau Banau Brycheiniog. Do you know about this one, Roy? You can still call them the Brecon Beacons. It's okay. Very little coverage of the main project for dramatic change in policy combat climate change and tourist pollution damage. That should be the story. And Theo Davis Lewis has written a piece in The Spectator about this. So, basically, The the Brecon Beacons have been renamed in Welsh. Okay? So the official name is now the truth is according to Theo Davis Lewis, it always was, And yet it's become the latest sort of woke thing. Nigel Farage is saying, this is absolutely awful, and what on earth do we do? And we can't call them the Brecon Beacons anymore. You can call them the Brecon Beacons, but it is actually part of Wales. And they are they are calling it this because then they're making it part of a bigger A bigger thing about, tourist pollution damage, and I think it's a very, very sensible thing to do. And what I think this is actually is a bit of a kind of anti Welshness and and and also anti Welsh language. We talked about the language recently. Welsh is one of the top 50 most influential languages in the world according to the latest edition the world language barometer. So let's hear it for the Welsh language, Rory. Very good. Very good. That that that that maybe was not your best question ever given that you began from the moment she got to the end of it having introduced it as a question to me, but we'll move on move on to a a next question. You can you can still answer. You can still answer. Right? I think I think you did a good job. You did a good job there. Reaction to Biden visit. Brian Walsh, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts as to the coverage afforded by the British press with respect to the presidential visit to Ireland, north and south. Some has been borderline racist, perpetuating 19th century tropes and possibly revealing more about the individual author's worldview as much providing any insightful commentary. Is this representative of the state of Anglo Irish and Anglo American relations? Well, I we we we touched on this when we were in in Belfast. I think there is an element of, I think it's more about actually us feeling very unsure in our own identity at a time when the Irish actually feel pretty confident, not least because they're projecting 6% growth, and we're sort of limping on along with Russia. So I thought the coverage some of the coverage in the UK media of Biden's visit was utterly ridiculous. I really do. I know you think he was a bit rude, to the UK, but I I just think he's he he was show wearing his Irish shoes on his sleeve. He was welcomed there perhaps more than he had been in in Belfast. And and I just think the sort of, you know, the Andrew Neals and the GBBs people just threw their toys out of the pram. I was talking to somebody in Belfast while we were there just when I was out on the streets, And he felt, for what it's worth, a real sense of hurt that Biden hadn't engaged more. He very much Felt that the US had been absolutely vital to the Good Friday Agreement as as you very much say, very much acknowledge, And he was very sad that he felt that Biden wasn't leaning in harder, spending more time in Northern Ireland getting directly involved. And I think that that was striking, that he seems to have sort of, instead of doing what I think Would have been more Clinton style, which is to roll his sleeves up and say, okay. I'll get involved. He seemed to be more saying, sort yourselves out, or if you don't, I'm not gonna make a proper visit. Well, I think he'd I think he'd done he would argue, I think, that he'd done the sleeves rolling in Washington when he met the parties and tried, at number 10's behest to try and get them over the line because he's told that was that that's what what it required. And then when that did happen a day or two using his immense Political capital and influence on the ground in Belfast at that critical time. The the the I don't know the answer to that. But there was all this talk about there was gonna be They ate dinner, and king Charles was going to go, and all that kind of stuff. I don't know is the answer, but he was always going to do that trip to Ireland. And I think that, you know, I'd I he look. The truth is he's the president of America. He probably gets asked to go to every country in the world every day of the week. He has to make judgments about how he uses time. The other thing, the optics, I think they may have thought that the optics of him being around around the Good Friday Agreement at a time when Bill Bill Clinton was there. Hillary Clinton was there. George Mitchell was there. He there is an argument that it would look like he was trying to insert himself into something that was actually about something else. I don't know. Here's a good one, Troy, for you. You can definitely answer this one. I I I will just be quiet. Gibson Fender, is Tony Blair still the best politician in the UK? Unpopular opinion for sure, But who, since he left, has been better? Come on. I I remain extremely grumpy, like many of us, about the Iraq war and think that revealed something troubling about him. At the same time, obviously, spending more time with you and seeing a bit of him, I have been very, very struck by his energy, his intelligence, his skill at communication, his commitment. So I think you you mount a very, very, powerful defense. Is is the question who's the best politician or the best ex prime minister? Well, Well, the question is, who since he left has been better? Well, it's very difficult to to compare people who've not been prime ministers to people who've been prime ministers, haven't Have they? Or would you say any of the prime ministers have been better? No. I'm probably not as an effective prime minister. Although I would say that I I have a much profound, affection for Theresa May. I I I I I know you do. I I like her very much as a person. I think she's a wonderful kind of I love her values. I will say as well for Theresa May, when you couldn't stay to do Mary McAleese, but Mary McAleese was very, very nice about Theresa May. Alison, lots of questions asked, including some quite serious ones we're gonna get to hop into, so let's just take a quick break. Welcome back to the Restless Politics question time with me, Rory Stewart. And me, Alice Campbell. Charlie O'Neil. Yep. As you've both done many, many TV and radio interviews over your careers, what would you say are your favorite and least favorite TV or radio shows to go on and why. Well, I don't particularly like the comedy shows. So I did things like Have I Got News For You, but I I feel a bit weird as a politician going on to what's fundamentally a comedy show. Yeah. I played my bagpipes on that one. Well, there we go. I see it's a good good decision good decision. Always good decision. Funny I'd stuck to the piping a bit more and been a bit more serious, I would have been Much more successful. I think I always enjoy the today programme. Love doing the today programme. Happy doing news tonight. Love hard talk. Question time I quite enjoy. How about you? I I like the ones that I really, really like The Late Late Show in Dublin. Always enjoy doing that. I I like I do like the longer form ones. I know what you mean about the comedy of things, but I like the ones where you can kind of not be the the the job with Newsnight and the Today Programme, those programmes, I think people just go into a mode. The interviewers are in a mode. The interviewees are in a mode. I do remember when my first book came out, and, of course, I'd had a lot of trouble with the stay program over the whole Andrew Gilligan that led to the Hutton inquiry, David Kelly's death, etcetera. So When my 1st volume of diaries came out, I was, like, the 8:10 interviewee on the Today program with John Humphries. And I think I'm right in saying it's the only time they ever went through the news and the sport. They just kept going. I think John Humphries was determined just to keep going until I either lamp at him or I'd lost my rag or or whatever. So I I like it when you do have a bit of that's why I enjoy this podcast. I like it when you've got a little bit of time to explain, to explore. I think The Late Late Show is is I I would put down as, one of my favorites. Talking of bagpipes, talking of bagpipes, Rory, Aileen Pierce, Where have you most enjoyed playing the pipes? Either because of the location, the audience, or the occasion. And Aileen says You'll find that the correct answer is Hillsborough Castle throne room. This was where I played the lament that I wrote for the the departed For Mo Mulam and other peacemakers, for Mo Mullam and David Trimble, etcetera. I played it to there was a the after you left on the Thursday, there was a really nice event at Hillsborough Castle, which is the official residence of the King, I guess, in Northern Ireland. And it was for schoolchildren from across the divide, as it were, from all over Northern Ireland, and I and I played it there. And it actually for me, it is often about the acoustics. The acoustics in the hall in Belfast were great. The acoustics in Hillsborough Castle We're great. I go every year to play the bagpipes at Charles Kennedy's grave, and I do that partly out of friendship, but also to be honest because it's one of the beautiful burial grounds in the world. And, I maybe this is my depressive character, but I do have a bit of a I do love a lament. I love a good lament. Where have you most enjoyed playing the pipes? Well, I think the worst the worst place I played the pipes was in Hong Kong because I found someone the humidity was really Screwing around with my my reeds and my drones. Yeah. They have. Trying to think what the best place home in Scotland's probably the best place. But Unlike you, I'm really, really bad. I've only played in big pipe bands where my lamentable performance can be disguised by the noise of the other people around me. Betting markets are giving Kamal Kilijdaroglu a 60% chance of winning the next Turkish Presidential election. So that's the leader of the main opposition party. Do you think this is a reasonable estimate of his chances? What happens if he wins? So Very, very interesting turnaround. Partly sparked, I think, we when I was in southern Turkey in the earthquake zone, we talked a little bit about the earthquake. Yeah. The ways in which the response to the earthquake might have affected Erdogan's Erdogan's position and popularity thoughts on Turkey? Well, first of all, I think it I'm right in saying this is my my son Rory speaking to me now, The Real Rory, because he knows a lot about betting markets. And I think, in general, Betting markets tend historically this is certainly the case in America and Britain. They tend historically to be more accurate in their predictions of elections than the polls. That's the first thing I'd say. Now I think Turkey's probably a bit different. I think if that is how the betting markets are looking at it, Then and the polls are kind of in roughly the same place. Then what that says to me is Erdogan will do absolutely everything he has to do to try to turn that around. And I suspect that I wouldn't I I think a 60% chance of winning sounds great. But I think to oust him, You're gonna need more than that at the start of the campaign. If he wins, that's a massive, massive, massive change. I mean, to the in a way, I think that the in a way, the Turkish election may be the most important in the world this year. Well, just to just to remind people a little bit about about what's going on here. So he's the leader of the CHP, which was the traditional ruling party, sees itself back to Kamal Ataturk, was close to the military, and was the ruling party that was basically displaced by Erdogan's party, which was more of an Islamist party and more of a party that applied, appealed to people who the poorer, The more religious elements in society. So and the CHP was destroyed, really, by Erdogan and has been rebuilt, by Kili Tscharoglu, who is a man who very, very, you know, intellectually strong, was a senior civil servant, Has had an extraordinary life as a politician. He's he's sort of we we were staying in the Europa Hotel, which has the record for being the when we were in Belfast, you and I, the most Attacked hotel in the world, but he has to be one of the most attacked politicians in the world. He's been, you know, punched in parliament. His Convoys been hit by missiles from the PKK. He was then bombed by the Islamic state. Somebody tried to lynch him at a soldier's funeral. So I think he's somebody who has managed to, with a very quiet manner, unite the 6 opposition parties behind him Mhmm. And has made a brand of Technocratic calm, and and it will be fascinating to see him come through. He's a deeply reassuring figure. Okay. Math Matthew Hisband, How do you and Rory feel about government ministers dressing like this, I'll explain in a minute, and using this type of rhetoric on social media against disabled and vulnerable people, while the likes of Michel Mone laughs at the gullibility of the country while stealing millions. And this is something I commented out at the time. This is a guy called Tom Purse Glove, There is a minister in the DWP. And when he she when he talk when the the Matthew talks about ministers dressing like this, he's wearing, like, a police flak jacket. It's got DWP on it, and he's basically saying, we're gonna get you. If you're cheating your benefits, we're gonna get you. And as somebody said on in the media. He he he looks like he's trying to look like Liam Neeson in Taken. He looks like a kind of, you know, robot cop out to get people. And there were 2 thing. Well, I did think it was, it was attention seeking, unnecessary, and and and and there there is, as Matthew points out, The massive contract contrasts with the lack of action going against people who've actually ripped off massive sums of the public purse, not just a few quids here and there in benefits. But the other thing that really troubled me was that his his Twitter handle is at vote purse glove. And this video was posted on a DWP government site. Now we're in a local election period. To have your Twitter handle as at vote and then your name, even though you're not standing as a candidate, I'm afraid that that, to me, Simon we saw Simon and Casey in Belfast. Somebody in the civil service needs to get a grip of the relentless, in small ways and large ways, politicization of the resources of the state. You cannot have a handle of vote purse glove and have that promoted by your government department, in my humble opinion. That seems good. Okay. Final question for me because I think we're coming to the end here. Grace, I'm expecting my 1st child, and I found that since being pregnant, I've become utterly obsessed with the news. I can't stop reading, scrolling, listening to all things news, which inevitably is more bad than good. I feel it's the important and responsible thing to do to be up to date on what's going on in the world. But I'm having dreams about war and the future of the planet, all that fun stuff. Do you have any tips on avoiding news anxiety? Did you find becoming parents altered your news consumption or your reactions to world events? My advice, Grace, is read books, not newspapers, and listen to music, not the news. And and our podcast. You you don't think our podcast is contributing to her anxiety? I hope not. I think we try I think we've got quite calming voices. No. I I I can see that, but I I I honestly I know because we you and I try to stay reasonably well informed. Okay? But I don't read newspapers. We We don't have a single newspaper delivered to our house. I feel terrible saying that having been journalists, but we don't. I don't I very rarely watch the news. I don't feel that there's much going on that I don't know about because big stuff you get to hear about. And I think it's actually deciding what you're interested in and then kind of trying to explore that in greater detail. And I'm serious about reading books, not newspapers. I got more. You've mentioned a couple of books that you read ahead of going to Belfast, for example, David Atrik's book on The Troubles and the one you talked talked about earlier. And, likewise, that book, if I were to say to somebody, right, you wanna try and get inside what's happening in Northern Ireland, or you wanna get inside Europe. There's some amazing sort of books on the history of Europe. You're gonna learn more than you are by reading some nonsense in the newspaper. So, Grace, books, not newspapers. Music, not the news. And I'll I'll finish with just answering question from Harrison. Where do you find the best place to get your news from? I've been promoting a lot, and I like to keep promoting The New York Times on international news and always look at Al Jazeera. Always worth looking at Algecirib. They do surprising amount of serious reporting on places that other people are not reporting. My final question is from Sarah Kate, And this allows me to do something which I don't normally do. You normally do it for me, which is to plug my book, which I finally got in my hands, the real thing. And very beautiful, beautiful book. Yeah. But the thing is, Sarah's questions suggest, Roy, that despite you plugging my book relentlessly on this podcast, as I promised to return the compliment when yours comes out in September, I think she slightly misunderstood the book. She says, you keep talking about engaging young people, which is really important, but we all need to be engaged in politics, And probably loads of people from a mixed range of ages ages aren't engaged. Is it still worth them reading, but what can I do? How do we engage everyone? Of course, it is. What can I do is all of us? What can all of us do? And the answer is we have to do whatever we can do. Everybody read that book carefully, and we'll take some questions on the book. In fact, we'll question you to make sure you've read it carefully enough. In the newsletter, we're but but both you and I, Rory, are going to do a thing through the The rest is politics where people can get signed copies. We we we will explain in the newsletter how that gets done. Very good. Okay. Thank you all so much. Bye bye. See you soon.",

That's the rest is politics.com.\n\nSpeaker 1: Welcome to the Restless Politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alastair Campbell. And, Rory, we should reward somebody by the name of Simon Beale, because he has been putting this question in week after week after week after week. And he hasn't given up. And in my new book, which I can now show you, Roy, there is my new book. And I've invented a word, which is perseverance.\n\nPerseverance is the combination of perseverance and resilience. So this guy, Simon, has had the setback of not having his question answered. But he's persevered, and, therefore, he's a very persevering character. And his question is quite a tough one. What role does nepotism play in public life?\n\nHave you ever been the beneficiary of it and or provided it?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think in certainly in political life, there's there's much less, I think, than people outside think. There are I mean, nepotism, of course, As everyone knows, is about, favouring your own family, generally your own kids. Mhmm. And What actually has changed in British politics is that it was a very, very strong factor, obviously, in the 19th century. People like Winston Churchill, you know, his father had been chancellor, His grandfather had been in parliament, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nNowadays, there are MPs who have parents in parliament on both sides of the house, the Labour MPs who have, And in fact, the Labour MP who's both whose parents were in the house and who I think is is married to a member of parliament.\n\nSpeaker 0: Ah, John Cryer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Son of Anne Cryer and Bob Cryer, both former Labour MPs, and, of course, he's married to Ellie Reeves, who's the Labour MP for Lewisham West and whose sister is Rachel Reeves, the current shadow chancer of the Checkout. How about that? Anyway, in on the conservative side, the people who had parents who were, in the house commons were people like Nicholas Soames, Who, of course, was was Churchill's grandson, Dominic Grieve?\n\nSpeaker 0: Andrew Mitchell? Richard Bennion,\n\nSpeaker 1: Andrew Mitchell. Yep. And many of these people Actually, we're more on the left of the party. They were in something called the 1 nation dining club with me. And in a sense, it seemed that the fact that they were children of MPs gave them a sort of, I think a sort of slightly more left of center type of conservatism, less strident.\n\nI mean, Dominic Raab, who we've been talking about a great deal, his dad, Peter, Came from Czech Republic at the age of 6 on a Kindertransport, became a food manager at M&S, died when Dom was 12, So definitely, you know, an example of a very different route, which is is true of many many MPs.\n\nSpeaker 0: I get I guess I guess what Simon means by the question in relation And where maybe it is more apparent is is the you do see an awful lot of MPs who employ members of their family. Now I've I've spoken to MPs whose wives run their constituency office, and they say, actually, because they it means that they don't have to pay them, and they just kinda run it, and it's almost like it's part of the marriage. But And then and, you know, one of my one of my sons, Calum, he he worked for the Labour Party, for a while. And I actually think in a in a weird sort of way, it it can be worse for the for the for the child of the person who's well known. I I think Economies to get really fed up of people saying, well, that's Hamster Campbell's son.\n\nI think sometimes it can be harder if you're coming from what is perceived as nepotism. My daughter, Grace, who is, you know, is a comedian, she does a whole story about how which is a true story, by the way. She says that Once before a Manchester United man match, she was she was in the tunnel as the players were coming out, just because that's how nepotism works. So you You can I think I think that's the only place where I have it's actually been the fact that I can get invited to stuff? And because I'm feeling guilty about not being there when I should be, I I will phone the kids and say if I get you, you know, I can get you tickets for this, I can get you tickets for that.\n\nWhat do you think? I guess that's the sort of nepotism maybe I indulged in from time to time.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. John, Having recently read Prelude to Power and enjoyed it very much, by the way, I was struck by Alice's wavering of whether to leave mainstream journalism and take the job of the Labour Party. It made me wonder if either Rory or Alastair have ever regretted a career move.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I regretted although I regretted the move when when I was a journalist, when I left the Daily Mirror to go and work for Eddie Shah's Today newspaper because I ended up having a nervous breakdown. Now I don't actually regret the overall experience, but I I I made I definitely made the wrong decision in doing that. And I do re I I do regret I regret not having stood as an MP myself. I do regret that. And I can explain why at every stage of the last 20 odd years or 30 odd years, whatever it is.\n\nI've not done it, and I can explain why I don't want to do it now. But I'd but that that is something that sort of nags away at me. What about you?\n\nSpeaker 1: Elsa, I want to strongly encourage you to run to be an MP in the next election. It's not far away. It's a good option. Anyway, Me, my biggest regret is I was running a charity in Afghanistan called Turquoise Mountain. We were restoring the center of the old city Kabul, which is Back in 2008, and I was absolutely loving it, working with a few 100 people, bringing water supplies, sanitation.\n\nWe built a clinic, and I'd I'd built the whole thing from scratch. I'd started with 1 employee who was my driver, who I called my logistics manager, and we were really making a daily difference out on the Granaca Bowl, living there for 2, 3 years. And I then was approached by Harvard University to take a chair, professorial chair at Harvard University and be the director of a center, And I was flattered into doing it. I was just it just appealed to my ego. I was, like, yes, my\n\nSpeaker 0: That's what happened with me, but that's exactly what happened with me. I was flattered into believing that I had it in me to be the youngest news editor in Fleet Street. I was gonna be a news editor at 28, and it was a stupid decision.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's exactly right, me. So I thought this is amazing. I'm and Mike says old in that. I guess I was in my mid thirties, but full Harvard professor in my mid thirties. And, Actually, it didn't suit me at all.\n\nI would have been I much, much more enjoyed managing 2, 300 people on the ground in Afghanistan than I did trying to run an academic center. Jean\n\nSpeaker 0: Guy Cote, and he is, I'm guessing from that name, French Canadian, because his question is it and he posted an opinion poll suggesting that the Canadians seem reluctant to have Charles as king. And he says, do you think we could see a surge of republicanism in the Commonwealth in the next few years? So we posted a poll which showed a a a minority in favor of continuing the monarchy.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I think it's always a live issue. I think Republicanism of all sorts has been a live political issue for many, many years, and in some ways Britain is unusual still having a monarchy when most countries around the world Lawson, there was that famous joke of the the king of Egypt that in the end, there were gonna be only 5 kings left, The king of hearts, the king of clubs, the king of diamonds, the king of spades, and the king of England. But I think, And I I would say this, but I do think that King Charles has approached the job very well. I think, Prince William has a good reputation, and I think it's the the British monarchy is in quite a strong position. I I don't think there's anything at the moment which is, makes me think that people are able to push, but there are Commonwealth countries, of course.\n\nI mean, King Charles, when he was Prince Wales, one of the things he had to do last year, I think, was to go out to the Caribbean to visit a country that had decided they didn't want, the royal family anymore. I think he dealt with it very very well. You know, I don't think there's any sort of resentment there. I think he gave a good speech and engaged well and and left with very warm feelings, but One thing that's changed. I mean, the queen, remember, when she took over, went on a, I think, 7 months tour Yeah.\n\nAround all these different places. And I think Increasingly, the the Royal Family are maybe spend less time or have have maybe spent less time in other places, and I think that the pressures at distance are significant.\n\nSpeaker 0: I've just I've just found the poll while you were talking, and it's, 60% say they don't want Charles\n\nSpeaker 1: King. Right.\n\nSpeaker 0: It's quite high. Quite high.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Well but we've but, interestingly, these things go up and down, don't they? There was there was a moment in Australia where 20, 30 years ago where people really thought that that was gonna be the case, and then That seems to have turned around again.\n\nSpeaker 0: And I do think I've even Fiona, who's, you know, not exactly she's she's not on exactly the same page as you when it comes to Monica Horry. But she did say the other day. She's, god, could you imagine if somebody like Boris Johnson became an elected president.\n\nSpeaker 1: That's I think that's a good good line. I think it's it's I think that's right. I think you would hope that Tony Blair would become the elected president, but it could be Boris Johnson at which point you do worry about. Right. Next question from Discord.\n\nSo to encourage people to go on Discord. Discord is our stream where debate's happening, and it's from somebody who calls themselves not a PhD. Honestly, I can't believe how many times the question of what happened, why isn't the US the harbinger of democracy anymore, can be asked on this podcast, and at no point do people wonder, oh, wait, maybe it never was. Maybe the country didn't magically go from sponsoring coup after coup in the sixties, seventies, and eighties to magically being the world force for democracy in the nineties. What do you make of that?\n\nSpeaker 0: I think that is a PhD. Calls himself not a p not a PhD. I think there's a great PhD question there. Now there's a very, very fair point in that partly because American, less so under Trump, but most American presidents, they talk so much about America as the leader of the free world, as the great democratic force. But, actually, there is there is something in that about their about their you know, we've talked about this a lot.\n\nWe talked about it with Hillary Clinton. The the there's a mixed picture about America's America's role in the world.\n\nSpeaker 1: Good. And, also, this is another chance to plug my favorite book, Norman Mailer's Harlot's Ghost which is all about the CIA sponsoring these coups at exactly that period, and actually it's a very essentially making this point which not a PhD is making which Is, in a sense, the dark, troubling heart of American democracy is the weird connection between these these authoritarian special operations and its claim to be democracy. Here's a question for you. Veron, is Rupert Murdoch losing it, paying out 787,500,000 And firing Tucker Carlson, the jewel, and the Fox News crown.\n\nSpeaker 0: Is he losing it? Well, he's into his nineties. He's getting on, for sure. The Fox News settlement was must have been a very, very, very difficult or moment for him, but thoroughly deserved because Fox News' entire business model is founded on the exploitation of the 3 things that we talk about the whole time, terrorism, polarization, and post truth. Tucker Carlson is, you know, the questioner calls him the jewel in the Fox Fox News crown.\n\nTucker Carlson is the is an absolute, populist, polarizing, post truth. And the reason why this became such a the the settlement with the the people who'd done the,\n\nSpeaker 1: Dominion Voting Machines.\n\nSpeaker 0: Dominion Voting Machines. Yeah. The reason that's been so damaging is because the the the reality was exposed between what they were saying on air, presenting themselves as arbiters of, you know, as they call it, fair and balanced news, bullshit, and at the same time, what they were privately thinking, which is, you know, this is absolute nonsense. Now Tucker Carlson became the The guy who was kind of leading that, on air as it were, but he wasn't the only one. And the truth is within that organization, they all knew that that's the game.\n\nBy the way, it was the game from the word go. And it's why I think, although GB News is is seen as a bit of a joke by a lot of people, it's why we have to be very, very careful. Once you establish that it's normal for a country's main television channel, Fox News, which is watched more now than CNN, When it's accepted that lying and to feed your base, to to be to be to be nice to your viewers, to make them hear what they want to hear. That is very, very dangerous, and I think we've gotta be very, very careful we don't get the same thing here.\n\nSpeaker 1: You've interviewed Brian Cox on our leading podcast, and I believe, that in the settlement case with Jerry Hall, There was a clause put in saying that she couldn't give any information to the producers of succession. One of the interesting things, Also, I thought we're talking about earlier about, speaking truths to power, and I thought an interesting revelation on Murdoch came out of the end of the trial. So the end of the trial, the general counsel of FOX, which, you know, the senior lawyer, said to Murdoch that he'd done well. He said, I'm just gonna say it. They didn't lay a finger on you.\n\nAnd Murdoch has the self knowledge to disagree, And he pointed a finger at the lawyer who'd questioned him for dominion, and he said, I think he would strongly disagree with that. And Nelson, who was the man that Was doing the question, he said, indeed I do, and I thought that was interesting. With all his weaknesses in his nineties, he's not Totally blown up with his own legend. If if one of his staff is flattering him when he knows he's screwed up, he can still call it out in public.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I look. I I did, I don't I don't like doing those interviews. You know, you do I'm sure you get asked to do lots while we do interviews for broadcasters who are preparing obituaries.\n\nI I don't like doing them, but I did do one the other day for for Murdoch, and they're asking everybody at the end, Murdoch force for good or force for bad over his lifetime, and I'm afraid I was very much forced for bad. I think, ultimately, with Murdoch's, impact upon politics and media around the world. There were there were being amazing things that he's done. There's no doubt about that. But I think particularly the the the impact of Fox News on America and some of his journalistic habits here ultimately have been a force for bad.\n\nYeah. We got a very nice message from a guy called Theo Davis Lewis, who, amongst other things, he's he's politically active down in Wales, but he he also writes for the The Spectator. And he has he wants us to talk about something which has also been raised by, I'm gonna have to say this in Welsh because the name of the person is clearly something in Welsh, but I don't know what it means. It's Fauch Sines. I hope that is sort of vaguely anyway, the question is this.\n\nThere is so much huffing and puffing about the official adoption of the native Banau Banau Brycheiniog. Do you know about this one, Roy? You can still call them the Brecon Beacons. It's okay. Very little coverage of the main project for dramatic change in policy combat climate change and tourist pollution damage.\n\nThat should be the story. And Theo Davis Lewis has written a piece in The Spectator about this. So, basically, The the Brecon Beacons have been renamed in Welsh. Okay? So the official name is now the truth is according to Theo Davis Lewis, it always was, And yet it's become the latest sort of woke thing.\n\nNigel Farage is saying, this is absolutely awful, and what on earth do we do? And we can't call them the Brecon Beacons anymore. You can call them the Brecon Beacons, but it is actually part of Wales. And they are they are calling it this because then they're making it part of a bigger A bigger thing about, tourist pollution damage, and I think it's a very, very sensible thing to do. And what I think this is actually is a bit of a kind of anti Welshness and and and also anti Welsh language.\n\nWe talked about the language recently. Welsh is one of the top 50 most influential languages in the world according to the latest edition the world language barometer. So let's hear it for the Welsh language, Rory.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Very good. That that that that maybe was not your best question ever given that you began from the moment she got to the end of it having introduced it as a question to me, but we'll move on move on to a a next question.\n\nSpeaker 0: You can you can still answer. You can still answer.\n\nSpeaker 1: Right? I think I think you did a good job. You did a good job there. Reaction to Biden visit. Brian Walsh, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts as to the coverage afforded by the British press with respect to the presidential visit to Ireland, north and south.\n\nSome has been borderline racist, perpetuating 19th century tropes and possibly revealing more about the individual author's worldview as much providing any insightful commentary. Is this representative of the state of Anglo Irish and Anglo American relations?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I we we we touched on this when we were in in Belfast. I think there is an element of, I think it's more about actually us feeling very unsure in our own identity at a time when the Irish actually feel pretty confident, not least because they're projecting 6% growth, and we're sort of limping on along with Russia. So I thought the coverage some of the coverage in the UK media of Biden's visit was utterly ridiculous. I really do. I know you think he was a bit rude, to the UK, but I I just think he's he he was show wearing his Irish shoes on his sleeve.\n\nHe was welcomed there perhaps more than he had been in in Belfast. And and I just think the sort of, you know, the Andrew Neals and the GBBs people just threw their toys out of the pram.\n\nSpeaker 1: I was talking to somebody in Belfast while we were there just when I was out on the streets, And he felt, for what it's worth, a real sense of hurt that Biden hadn't engaged more. He very much Felt that the US had been absolutely vital to the Good Friday Agreement as as you very much say, very much acknowledge, And he was very sad that he felt that Biden wasn't leaning in harder, spending more time in Northern Ireland getting directly involved. And I think that that was striking, that he seems to have sort of, instead of doing what I think Would have been more Clinton style, which is to roll his sleeves up and say, okay. I'll get involved. He seemed to be more saying, sort yourselves out, or if you don't, I'm not gonna make a proper visit.\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, I think he'd I think he'd done he would argue, I think, that he'd done the sleeves rolling in Washington when he met the parties and tried, at number 10's behest to try and get them over the line because he's told that was that that's what what it required. And then when that did\n\nSpeaker 1: happen a day or two using his immense Political capital and influence on the ground in Belfast at that critical time.\n\nSpeaker 0: The the the I don't know the answer to that. But there was all this talk about there was gonna be They ate dinner, and king Charles was going to go, and all that kind of stuff. I don't know is the answer, but he was always going to do that trip to Ireland. And I think that, you know, I'd I he look. The truth is he's the president of America.\n\nHe probably gets asked to go to every country in the world every day of the week. He has to make judgments about how he uses time. The other thing, the optics, I think they may have thought that the optics of him being around around the Good Friday Agreement at a time when Bill Bill Clinton was there. Hillary Clinton was there. George Mitchell was there.\n\nHe there is an argument that it would look like he was trying to insert himself into something that was actually about something else. I don't know. Here's a good one, Troy, for you. You can definitely answer this one. I I I will just be quiet.\n\nGibson Fender, is Tony Blair still the best politician in the UK? Unpopular opinion for sure, But who, since he left, has been better? Come on.\n\nSpeaker 1: I I remain extremely grumpy, like many of us, about the Iraq war and think that revealed something troubling about him. At the same time, obviously, spending more time with you and seeing a bit of him, I have been very, very struck by his energy, his intelligence, his skill at communication, his commitment. So I think you you mount a very, very, powerful defense. Is is the question who's the best politician or the best ex prime minister?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, Well, the question is, who since he left has been better?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's very difficult to to compare people who've not been prime ministers to people who've been prime ministers, haven't Have they? Or would\n\nSpeaker 0: you say any of the prime ministers have been better?\n\nSpeaker 1: No. I'm probably not as an effective prime minister. Although I would say that I I have a much profound, affection for Theresa May. I I I I\n\nSpeaker 0: I know\n\nSpeaker 1: you do. I I like her very much as a person. I think she's a wonderful kind of I love her values.\n\nSpeaker 0: I will say as well for Theresa May, when you couldn't stay to do Mary McAleese, but Mary McAleese was very, very nice about Theresa May.\n\nSpeaker 1: Alison, lots of questions asked, including some quite serious ones we're gonna get to hop into, so let's just take a quick break. Welcome back to the Restless Politics question time with me, Rory Stewart.\n\nSpeaker 0: And me, Alice Campbell. Charlie O'Neil. Yep. As you've both done many, many TV and radio interviews over your careers, what would you say are your favorite and least favorite TV or radio shows to go on and why.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I don't particularly like the comedy shows. So I did things like Have I Got News For You, but I I feel a bit weird as a politician going on to what's fundamentally a comedy show.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I played my bagpipes on that one.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, there we go. I see it's a good good decision good decision. Always good decision. Funny I'd stuck to the piping a bit more and been a bit more serious, I would have been Much more successful. I think I always enjoy the today programme.\n\nLove doing the today programme. Happy doing news tonight. Love hard talk. Question time I quite enjoy. How about you?\n\nSpeaker 0: I I like the ones that I really, really like The Late Late Show in Dublin. Always enjoy doing that. I I like I do like the longer form ones. I know what you mean about the comedy of things, but I like the ones where you can kind of not be the the the job with Newsnight and the Today Programme, those programmes, I think people just go into a mode. The interviewers are in a mode.\n\nThe interviewees are in a mode. I do remember when my first book came out, and, of course, I'd had a lot of trouble with the stay program over the whole Andrew Gilligan that led to the Hutton inquiry, David Kelly's death, etcetera. So When my 1st volume of diaries came out, I was, like, the 8:10 interviewee on the Today program with John Humphries. And I think I'm right in saying it's the only time they ever went through the news and the sport. They just kept going.\n\nI think John Humphries was determined just to keep going until I either lamp at him or I'd lost my rag or or whatever. So I I like it when you do have a bit of that's why I enjoy this podcast. I like it when you've got a little bit of time to explain, to explore. I think The Late Late Show is is I I would put down as, one of my favorites. Talking of bagpipes, talking of bagpipes, Rory, Aileen Pierce, Where have you most enjoyed playing the pipes?\n\nEither because of the location, the audience, or the occasion. And Aileen says You'll find that the correct answer is Hillsborough Castle throne room. This was where I played the lament that I wrote for the the departed For\n\nSpeaker 1: Mo Mulam and other\n\nSpeaker 0: peacemakers, for Mo Mullam and David Trimble, etcetera. I played it to there was a the after you left on the Thursday, there was a really nice event at Hillsborough Castle, which is the official residence of the King, I guess, in Northern Ireland. And it was for schoolchildren from across the divide, as it were, from all over Northern Ireland, and I and I played it there. And it actually for me, it is often about the acoustics. The acoustics in the hall in Belfast were great.\n\nThe acoustics in Hillsborough Castle We're great. I go every year to play the bagpipes at Charles Kennedy's grave, and I do that partly out of friendship, but also to be honest because it's one of the beautiful burial grounds in the world. And, I maybe this is my depressive character, but I do have a bit of a I do love a lament. I love a good lament. Where have you most enjoyed playing the pipes?\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think the worst the worst place I played the pipes was in Hong Kong because I found someone the humidity was really Screwing around with my my reeds and my drones.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. They have. Trying to\n\nSpeaker 1: think what the best place home in Scotland's probably the best place. But Unlike you, I'm really, really bad. I've only played in big pipe bands where my lamentable performance can be disguised by the noise of the other people around me. Betting markets are giving Kamal Kilijdaroglu a 60% chance of winning the next Turkish Presidential election. So that's the leader of the main opposition party.\n\nDo you think this is a reasonable estimate of his chances? What happens if he wins? So Very, very interesting turnaround. Partly sparked, I think, we when I was in southern Turkey in the earthquake zone, we talked a little bit about\n\nSpeaker 0: the earthquake.\n\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. The ways in which the response to the earthquake might have affected Erdogan's Erdogan's position and popularity thoughts on Turkey?\n\nSpeaker 0: Well, first of all, I think it I'm right in saying this is my my son Rory speaking to me now, The Real Rory, because he knows a lot about betting markets. And I think, in general, Betting markets tend historically this is certainly the case in America and Britain. They tend historically to be more accurate in their predictions of elections than the polls. That's the first thing I'd say. Now I think Turkey's probably a bit different.\n\nI think if that is how the betting markets are looking at it, Then and the polls are kind of in roughly the same place. Then what that says to me is Erdogan will do absolutely everything he has to do to try to turn that around. And I suspect that I wouldn't I I think a 60% chance of winning sounds great. But I think to oust him, You're gonna need more than that at the start of the campaign. If he wins, that's a massive, massive, massive change.\n\nI mean, to the in a way, I think that the in a way, the Turkish election may be the most important in the world this year.\n\nSpeaker 1: Well, just to just to remind people a little bit about about what's going on here. So he's the leader of the CHP, which was the traditional ruling party, sees itself back to Kamal Ataturk, was close to the military, and was the ruling party that was basically displaced by Erdogan's party, which was more of an Islamist party and more of a party that applied, appealed to people who the poorer, The more religious elements in society. So and the CHP was destroyed, really, by Erdogan and has been rebuilt, by Kili Tscharoglu, who is a man who very, very, you know, intellectually strong, was a senior civil servant, Has had an extraordinary life as a politician. He's he's sort of we we were staying in the Europa Hotel, which has the record for being the when we were in Belfast, you and I, the most Attacked hotel in the world, but he has to be one of the most attacked politicians in the world. He's been, you know, punched in parliament.\n\nHis Convoys been hit by missiles from the PKK. He was then bombed by the Islamic state. Somebody tried to lynch him at a soldier's funeral. So I think he's somebody who has managed to, with a very quiet manner, unite the 6 opposition parties behind him Mhmm. And has made a brand of Technocratic calm, and and it will be fascinating to see him come through.\n\nHe's a deeply reassuring figure.\n\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Math Matthew Hisband, How do you and Rory feel about government ministers dressing like this, I'll explain in a minute, and using this type of rhetoric on social media against disabled and vulnerable people, while the likes of Michel Mone laughs at the gullibility of the country while stealing millions. And this is something I commented out at the time. This is a guy called Tom Purse Glove, There is a minister in the DWP. And when he she when he talk when the the Matthew talks about ministers dressing like this, he's wearing, like, a police flak jacket.\n\nIt's got DWP on it, and he's basically saying, we're gonna get you. If you're cheating your benefits, we're gonna get you. And as somebody said on in the media. He he he looks like he's trying to look like Liam Neeson in Taken. He looks like a kind of, you know, robot cop out to get people.\n\nAnd there were 2 thing. Well, I did think it was, it was attention seeking, unnecessary, and and and and there there is, as Matthew points out, The massive contract contrasts with the lack of action going against people who've actually ripped off massive sums of the public purse, not just a few quids here and there in benefits. But the other thing that really troubled me was that his his Twitter handle is at vote purse glove. And this video was posted on a DWP government site. Now we're in a local election period.\n\nTo have your Twitter handle as at vote and then your name, even though you're not standing as a candidate, I'm afraid that that, to me, Simon we saw Simon and Casey in Belfast. Somebody in the civil service needs to get a grip of the relentless, in small ways and large ways, politicization of the resources of the state. You cannot have a handle of vote purse glove and have that promoted by your government department, in my humble opinion.\n\nSpeaker 1: That seems good. Okay. Final question for me because I think we're coming to the end here. Grace, I'm expecting my 1st child, and I found that since being pregnant, I've become utterly obsessed with the news. I can't stop reading, scrolling, listening to all things news, which inevitably is more bad than good.\n\nI feel it's the important and responsible thing to do to be up to date on what's going on in the world. But I'm having dreams about war and the future of the planet, all that fun stuff. Do you have any tips on avoiding news anxiety? Did you find becoming parents altered your news consumption or your reactions to world events?\n\nSpeaker 0: My advice, Grace, is read books, not newspapers, and listen to music, not the news.\n\nSpeaker 1: And and our podcast. You you don't think our podcast is contributing to her anxiety?\n\nSpeaker 0: I hope not. I think we try I think we've got quite calming voices. No. I I I can see that, but I I I honestly I know because we you and I try to stay reasonably well informed. Okay?\n\nBut I don't read newspapers. We We don't have a single newspaper delivered to our house. I feel terrible saying that having been journalists, but we don't. I don't I very rarely watch the news. I don't feel that there's much going on that I don't know about because big stuff you get to hear about.\n\nAnd I think it's actually deciding what you're interested in and then kind of trying to explore that in greater detail. And I'm serious about reading books, not newspapers. I got more. You've mentioned a couple of books that you read ahead of going to Belfast, for example, David Atrik's book on The Troubles and the one you talked talked about earlier. And, likewise, that book, if I were to say to somebody, right, you wanna try and get inside what's happening in Northern Ireland, or you wanna get inside Europe.\n\nThere's some amazing sort of books on the history of Europe. You're gonna learn more than you are by reading some nonsense in the newspaper. So, Grace, books, not newspapers. Music, not the news.\n\nSpeaker 1: And I'll I'll finish with just answering question from Harrison. Where do you find the best place to get your news from? I've been promoting a lot, and I like to keep promoting The New York Times on international news and always look at Al Jazeera. Always worth looking at Algecirib. They do surprising amount of serious reporting on places that other people are not reporting.\n\nSpeaker 0: My final question is from Sarah Kate, And this allows me to do something which I don't normally do. You normally do it for me, which is to plug my book, which I finally got in my hands, the real thing.\n\nSpeaker 1: And very beautiful, beautiful book.\n\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But the thing is, Sarah's questions suggest, Roy, that despite you plugging my book relentlessly on this podcast, as I promised to return the compliment when yours comes out in September, I think she slightly misunderstood the book. She says, you keep talking about engaging young people, which is really important, but we all need to be engaged in politics, And probably loads of people from a mixed range of ages ages aren't engaged. Is it still worth them reading, but what can I do? How do we engage everyone?\n\nOf course, it is. What can I do is all of us? What can all of us do? And the answer is we have to do whatever we can do.\n\nSpeaker 1: Everybody read that book carefully, and we'll take some questions on\n\nSpeaker 0: the book.\n\nSpeaker 1: In fact, we'll question you to make sure you've read it carefully enough.\n\nSpeaker 0: In the newsletter, we're but but both you and I, Rory, are going to do a thing through the The rest is politics where people can get signed copies. We we we will explain in the newsletter how that gets done.\n\nSpeaker 1: Very good. Okay. Thank you all so much. Bye bye. See\n\nSpeaker 0: you soon.",
